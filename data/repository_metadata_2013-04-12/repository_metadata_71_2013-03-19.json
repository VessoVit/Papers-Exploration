The work starts with standard Hebbian learning then adds a compensatory modifier that forces the total synaptic weight leaving a neuron toward a constant.  This enables overlapping CAs because neurons that are in multiple categories have reduced weight stopping Assemblies merging. This provides a biologically plausible learning rule that eases the ability of CAs to overlap.  A more complex CA system based on this work, is being developed as part of a current EPSRC grant (EP/D059720/1).","bibo:AuthorList":["Huyck, Christian R."],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"C Huyck.

The counterexamples, suggested by Allais (1953)  and Ellsberg (1961), deserve special attention because they point at our lack of understanding of how humans make decisions.  The paradoxes of decision-making are particularly important for the ACT-R theory which currently relies on expected utility.  The paper presents two alternative methods: a random prediction method that uses subsymbolic computations and a method that uses symbolic reasoning for qualitative decision-making.  Both methods are tested on ACT-R models of the paradoxes, and the advantages of each method are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Belavkin, Roman V."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Allais.

The comparison is made by evaluating the performance of simple decision-theoretic agents in stochastic environments.  It is shown that not only the random choice strategies can achieve performance comparable to the max EU method, but under certain conditions the Monte-Carlo choice methods perform almost two times better than the max EU.

The entropy feedback is used to control these parameters and strategy, which in turn improves greatly the learning in the model as well as the model match with the data.

For example, the ACT-R cognitive architecture (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998) uses a powerful conflict resolution theory that allowed for modelling many characteristics of human decision making.  The results of more recent works, however, pointed to the need of revisiting the conflict resolution theory of ACT-R to incorporate more dynamics.  In the proposed theory the conflict is resolved using the estimates of the expected costs of production rules.  The method has been implemented as a stand alone search program as well as an add-on to the ACT-R architecture replacing the standard mechanism.  The method expresses more dynamic and adaptive behaviour.  The performance of the algorithm shows that it can be successfully used as a search and optimisation technique.","bibo:AuthorList":["Belavkin, Roman V."],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J R Anderson and C Lebiere.

The same programmes are also delivered to students at our London campus.  All programmes employ the same course management assessment and quality-control procedures so that all students ahave an equivalent learning experience.  These procedures comply with the standards laid down by the  Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) of the Higher Education Funding Council of of England (HEFCE).  Recently a sustainability analysis was completed correlating programme income with staff salary costs for all programmes offered by the University.  Using these figures we have been able to estimate the benefits of delivering the programmes with Global Campus e-learning materials in terms both of learning enhancement and cost reduction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Milankovic-Atkinson, Maya","Sadler, Chris"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2005).

Subsequently the authors adapted their existing model of culturally competent health care practice, and in this paper they propose it as a model for the development of culturally competent researchers. \r\nDiscussion\r\nThe model put forward by the authors consists of four concepts: cultural awareness, cultural knowledge, cultural sensitivity and cultural competence. A culturally competent researcher is one who is able to apply the related skills and knowledge in project design, data collection, analysis, report writing and dissemination. Furthermore, the authors identify two layers of cultural competence, those of culture-generic (knowledge and skills that are applicable across ethnic groups) and culture-specific competence (knowledge and skills that relate to a particular ethnic group).  The relationship between these two layers is a dynamic and spiralling process as illustrated by the model. \r\nConclusion\r\nCurrent health policy in many developed countries focuses on inequalities of health and managing diversity, including ethnicity. Thus the authors conclude that the development of culturally competent researchers will lead to both valid research and culturally competent practice by health care professionals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Papadopoulos, Irena","Lees, Shelley"],"dc:date":"2002-02-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":112418,"sim:weight":0.387697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.381838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539325,"sim:weight":0.353019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100463,"sim:weight":0.291083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99172,"sim:weight":0.248753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386857,"sim:weight":0.232019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.23167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225618,"sim:weight":0.226381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.224926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The sample consisted of 106 Ethiopians resident in the UK.\r\nResults: The majority of the participants fled Ethiopia due to political reasons. Whilst 65% of them had lived in the UK for over five years only 7% had full refugee status. Many of the participants faced difficulties with the immigration system, housing and social services and felt socially isolated. Many also had problems with gaining employment or employment appropriate to their qualifications, and 29% were unemployed. The majority of the participants believe that happiness is a prerequisite to healthiness and also an indication of healthiness. On the other hand the majority believed that sickness is caused by disease and mental illness is caused by both supernatural and psychosocial causes. Most of the participants sought the help of their GP in the first instance of illness although some had experienced difficulties accessing health services due to language problems and poor understanding of the primary health care system. The participants also believed that the stress of adaptation and settlement affected their mental health and led to stress and depression.\r\nConclusion: Migration, adaptation and settlement experiences impact on the health of refugees and are dependent on a number of barriers and enablers, both at a personal and societal level. These should be taken into account in the provision of health and social care services, in particular services should be provided in a culturally competent manner.","bibo:AuthorList":["Papadopoulos, Irena","Lees, Shelley","Lay, Margaret","Gebrehiwot, Alem"],"dc:date":"2004-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91801,"sim:weight":0.389387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159601,"sim:weight":0.371099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99772,"sim:weight":0.367488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108260,"sim:weight":0.363017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.349592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664196,"sim:weight":0.336986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107216,"sim:weight":0.33655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158128,"sim:weight":0.33655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45508,"sim:weight":0.335592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.327166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4161169,"sim:weight":0.327157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340786,"sim:weight":0.319049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47549,"sim:weight":0.317056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91023,"sim:weight":0.31176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43567,"sim:weight":0.301978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710046,"sim:weight":0.300355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57395,"sim:weight":0.291869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48382,"sim:weight":0.290693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383512,"sim:weight":0.290203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43687,"sim:weight":0.28376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To date few attempts have been made to measure the effectiveness of education and training programmes which are designed to promote cultural competence.  A research project commissioned by mental health service providers was undertaken to deal with the increasing need for cultural competence in a number of mental health care settings. It involved the delivery of a training intervention with an assessment of cultural competence before and after the intervention. The training intervention was negotiated with the participating teams and was based on the Papadopoulos, Tilki \u0026 Taylor model (1998). The project included the design and development of a tool for assessing cultural competence (CCATool). The paper discusses the challenges faced by the trainers during this intervention and proposes a set of principles for the development of effective cultural competence programmes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Papadopoulos, Irena","Tilki, Mary","Lees, Shelley"],"dc:date":"2004-11-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.310486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56059,"sim:weight":0.309368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4153920,"sim:weight":0.305683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91320,"sim:weight":0.299366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91540,"sim:weight":0.299366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108284,"sim:weight":0.292555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75080,"sim:weight":0.290579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109013,"sim:weight":0.275147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16179,"sim:weight":0.273934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97904,"sim:weight":0.263751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.263171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158045,"sim:weight":0.262388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539325,"sim:weight":0.260412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158974,"sim:weight":0.25982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154825,"sim:weight":0.253488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76136,"sim:weight":0.244134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.243969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160632,"sim:weight":0.243695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155247,"sim:weight":0.241449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160403,"sim:weight":0.238299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We describe a population-based search algorithm for cost minimisation of multicast routing. The algorithm utilises the partially mixed crossover operation (PMX) under the elitist model: for each element of the current population, the local\r\nsearch is based upon the results of a landscape analysis that is executed only once in a pre-processing step; the best solution found so far is always part of the population. The aim of the landscape analysis is to estimate the depth of the deepest local minima in the\r\nlandscape generated by the routing tasks and the objective function. The analysis employs simulated annealing with a logarithmic cooling schedule (logarithmic simulated annealing—LSA). The local search then performs alternating sequences of descending and ascending steps for each individual of the population, where the length of a sequence with uniform direction is controlled by\r\nthe estimated value of the maximum depth of local minima. We present results from computational experiments on three different routing tasks, and we provide experimental evidence that our genetic local search procedure that combines LSA and PMX performs better than algorithms using either LSA or PMX only.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zahrani, M.

It was then demonstrated that a supervised feed forward method gave more accurate results in predicting point mutation in genes than the neural network backpropagation method. This paper brought the technique to the attention of other researchers as to how the method can be used for this and for the prediction of other diseases. The technique had been widely used in analysing environmental data is now commonly used in Bioinformatics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khan, Nawaz","Chukwuemeka, Ikejiaku","Rahman, Shahedur"],"dc:date":"2005-05-23","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"W G Baxt.

A context graph is used to map data in order to establish an integration domain for the participating multi-resource database federation. Data are presented in a consolidated form upon retrieval from the multiple databases. The approach presented in this paper is novel in the sense that, it can be implemented within a component database and can initiate data consolidation collected from multiple sources without users\u0027 intervention. The approach has received considerable interest from the research community.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khan, Nawaz","Stockman, A.
