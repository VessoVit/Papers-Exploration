Its value lies in describing the surface chemomechanical properties of ingredients and\r\nexcipients used in food, nutraceutical, cosmetic (cosmeceutical), and natural drug-food product\r\nformulations that traverse the food sciences. Two surfactants, two food and drug-grade polymers,\r\nand five naturally occurring food and serum proteins were tested and used to estimate and model\r\ninterfacial viscoelasticity. Equilibration times of \u003e15 min were found to give sufficiently stable interfaces\r\nfor routine assessment. The viscoelasticity of the air–water interface was estimated with reference\r\nto model solutions. These model solutions and associated self-assembled interfacial nanostructured\r\nadsorbed layers were fabricated using a preliminary screening process with the aid of a specialized\r\nfoaming apparatus (C300 values), surface tension measurements (23–73 mN/m), and referential surface\r\nshear and dilation experiments. The viscoelasticity measured as a percentage of surface damping\r\n(D) of a pendulum was found to range from 1.0 to 22.4% across the samples tested, and this\r\nrepresented interfacial viscosities in the range of 0-4630 µNs/m. The technique can distinguish\r\nbetween interfacial compositions and positions itself as an easily accessible valuable addition to\r\ntensiometric and analytical biochemistry-based techniques.","bibo:AuthorList":["Collins, G.W.","Patel, Avani","Dilley, Alan","Sarker, D.K."],"dc:date":"2008-05-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387341,"sim:weight":0.301751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.287257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101462,"sim:weight":0.275117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.269492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.260978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98459,"sim:weight":0.260616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46779,"sim:weight":0.254122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.25245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102622,"sim:weight":0.250596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75750,"sim:weight":0.23943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98877,"sim:weight":0.238041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102703,"sim:weight":0.235069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98482,"sim:weight":0.231624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99449,"sim:weight":0.229781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43251,"sim:weight":0.229343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98959,"sim:weight":0.224552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18038,"sim:weight":0.218596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631673,"sim:weight":0.216439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.215997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98706,"sim:weight":0.213014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the existing tool support for creating Euler diagrams is limited to generic diagram editing software that uses mouse and keyboard interfaces. A more natural and convenient mode of entry is via a sketching interface.  In addition, it is known that sketching, as opposed to using an editing package, facilitates greater cognitive focus on the task of diagram creation. This paper presents the first sketch tool for Euler diagrams. In particular, we describe the recognition mechanism and conversion that takes a sketched Euler diagram and converts it into a formal diagram drawn with ellipses and circles. The semantics of the sketch is computed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Delaney, A.","Plimmer, B.","Stapleton, G.","Rodgers, P."],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631948,"sim:weight":0.516089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8418,"sim:weight":0.365213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98469,"sim:weight":0.164747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.158873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998215,"sim:weight":0.150654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12338,"sim:weight":0.149903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12403,"sim:weight":0.143735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.142323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.13762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997910,"sim:weight":0.136376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4393,"sim:weight":0.12188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.121315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8526,"sim:weight":0.116714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.113805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.113759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8313,"sim:weight":0.113529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26045,"sim:weight":0.0898147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931886,"sim:weight":0.0889814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99366,"sim:weight":0.0811451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931817,"sim:weight":0.0543144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The corpora were collected from dialogues in which two participants collaboratively solved Tangram puzzles with a puzzle simulator. Extra-linguistic information such as operations on puzzle pieces, mouse cursor position and piece positions were recorded in synchronisation with utterances. The speech data was transcribed and time-aligned with the extra-linguistic information. Referring expressions in utterances that refer to puzzle pieces were annotated in terms of their spans, their referents and their other attributes. The Japanese corpus has already been completed, but the English counter-part is still undergoing annotation. We have conducted a preliminary comparative analysis of both corpora, mainly with respect to task completion time, task success rates and attributes of referring expressions. These corpora showed significant differences in task completion time and success rate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tokunaga, Takenobu","Iidra, Ryu","Yasuhara, Masaaki","Terai, Asuka","Morris, D","Belz, A."],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Bahar Baran, Berrin Dogusoy and Kursat Cagiltay.

Here we describe a study of library users’ and\r\nstaff members’ expectations about the public library’s role in supporting citizens’ \r\n“healthwork.” We conducted our research in a public library in the United Kingdom that operates on a model of patron self-service. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews with library patrons and staff members as well as a\r\nwritten survey of patrons who had visited the library because of a health concern. Our findings suggest that the library’s users regard the public library as a highly trusted source of health information. The majority of surveyed users were in search of books relevant to their health concern, and more than half were able to locate what they needed on their own. While generally self-sufficient, some of the survey respondents as well as those who took part in the interviews indicated that they had consulted library staff for help, although they appeared uncertain about the level of reference support they should expect. Members of the library’s\r\nreference desk staff who took part in the interviews expressed frustration over policies that limit the time available to support patron’s inquiries, and many lacked training, particularly in online health information resources.

{"identifier":7966,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Innovation as Politics: The startling rise and reshaping of innovation in UK parliamentary discourse 1960-2005","bibo:abstract":"As Nick von Tunzelmann has argued, a major, sometimes the major, influence on industrial progress has been governmental institutions and ideologies, which shape the general climate of business opinion (von Tunzelmann, 1995: 21-22). Adherence to political ideology in government policy on innovation has been particularly keen in the UK (von Tunzelmann, 2004: 331). The primary form for disseminating these ideologies is language. This paper shows systematic evidence on the political discourse of innovation over a forty-five year period, and analyses both its stable and changing meanings. It asks whether the term innovation has become a ‘floating signifier’, a plastic concept used for a variety of political purposes.\r\n\r\nThe term innovation has become central to academic, political and practitioner discussion of the economy and the future of business (Barber and White, 1987; Fagerberg and Verspagen, 2008, Martin, 2008). In the UK innovation is central to the current Government’s policies and those of the opposition. Indeed, figure 1 shows that there has been a tenfold increase in the use of the term in parliamentary debates over the past forty-five-years. Researchers have taken a discourse approach to explore various aspects of innovation (e.g. Lovell, 2008; Salaman and Storey, 2002; Suchman and Bishop, 2000). A recent article by Linton begins to examine the language of innovation within the academic literature, suggesting that interpretation is influenced by one’s perspective (Linton, 2009).\r\n\r\nYet in addition to the academic literature, an important field of linguistic use of the term innovation is the field of politics. This paper starts to empirically research the use of innovation by tracing the plasticity of meaning of the term through forty-five-years of political debate in the UK Parliament; a period spanning from Wilson’s ‘white heat of technology’, through Thatcherism to Blair’s New Labour (e.g. Meredith, 2003). Before describing the  methodological approach to the research the paper explores the conception of meaning that underpins this investigation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Perren, Lew","Sapsed, Jonathan"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.584944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.58231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.432743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.402485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381996,"sim:weight":0.398088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.388778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.382427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382013,"sim:weight":0.37385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.371679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46821,"sim:weight":0.370718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45075,"sim:weight":0.353572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.346269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.331309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929836,"sim:weight":0.329107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.325591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44140,"sim:weight":0.315584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.190623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.186859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109759,"sim:weight":0.175356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.158755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The complex interplay between crustal and sea-level movements continues to influence the morphological development of the Scottish coast. A number of geophysical models predict ongoing uplift of the Scottish landmass. However, a number of recent studies based upon the analysis of satellite altimetry data indicate a late 20th Century acceleration in the rate of eustatic sea-level rise.\r\n\r\nDetailed geochemistry, radiometric dating, and diatom analysis on selected sediment cores from four mature coastal marsh environments in Argyll, western Scotland, provides an opportunity to investigate the linkages between Twentieth century crustal movements, eustatic sea-level rise and recent rates of sedimentation recorded within marsh sediments across the proposed Scottish glacio-isostatic uplift dome.\r\n\r\nSolid-phase major and trace element geochemistry has been used to examine the extent to which post-depositional physical disturbance and/or chemical reactions may have influenced the reliability of the radiometric dating methods. Geochemical data indicate that the evolution of these marsh environments has not been significantly influenced by physical disturbance and overall the supply of minerogenic material to the marshes has been quite uniform.\r\n\r\nVertical distributions of \u003csup\u003e210\u003c/sup\u003ePb\u003csub\u003eexcess\u003c/sub\u003e and \u003csup\u003e137\u003c/sup\u003eCs activity have been measured and used to develop models of recent marsh vertical accretion. Dating of the cores reveals subtle variations in the rates of sediment accumulation over the last c. 70 years between sites. For much of the last hundred years or so, sedimentation rates have been in good overall agreement with various estimations for sea-level rise, although at the more easterly sites these estimates are generally exceeded. However, quasi-equilibrium between marsh sedimentation and sea-level rise for much of the Twentieth Century is indicated from the Diatom analysis.\r\n\r\nOver the most recent period of marsh development (\u0026lt;10 years), a significant increase in the rate of surface sedimentation is recorded at all sites across the study area. Diatom analysis of these surface layers reveals an increase in the relative abundance of marine (polyhalobous) taxa in the near-surface sediments. This signifies a very recent increase in the rate of regional relative sea-level rise indicating that a regional threshold in coastal forcing has now been exceeded.\r\n\r\nThese findings provide clear evidence that recent relative sea-level rise is now outpacing estimated rates of glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) across the proposed Scottish uplift dome.","bibo:AuthorList":["Teasdale, P.","Collins, P.E.F.","Firth, C.R.","Cundy, A.B."],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Ackerman.

This paper undertakes such analysis in the Console Games sector, articulating the impact of the innovation activities of video games studios producing complementary inputs on its technological trajectory and dominant design. The recent introduction of a new dominant design in the sector constitutes a natural experiment that indicates the presence of inertias in the innovation behaviours of these agents. These inertias are explored through an in-depth study of 7 UK games studios, which identifies self-reinforcing organisational, management and recruitment practices linked to the culture and values of the communities involved in games development, resulting in cultural homogeneity in both workforce and management positions. This homogeneity favours incremental innovation and obstructs the exploration of alternative dominant designs, thus impacting on the outcomes of market competition, and shaping the sector’s technological trajectory","bibo:AuthorList":["Mateos-Garcia, Juan","Grantham, Andrew","Sapsed, Jonathan","Steinmueller, W Edward","Voss, Georgina"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Artificial fluorescent particles designed to mimic the size and density of organic slurry particles were found to move off the grassland via inter-flow (surface + lateral through-flow) and drain-flow. Where both pathways were present the drains carried the greater number of particles. The results of the natural fluorescence and δ\u003csup\u003e13\u003c/sup\u003eC of water samples were inconclusive. Natural fluorescence was higher from slurry-amended lysimeters than from zero-slurry lysimeters, however, a fluorescence decay experiment suggested that no slurry signal should be present given the time between slurry application and the onset of drainage. The δ\u003csup\u003e13\u003c/sup\u003eC values of more than 0.7 µm and less than 0.7 µm material in drainage were varied and unrelated to discharge. The mean value of  more than 0.7 µm δ\u003csup\u003e13\u003c/sup\u003eC in water from the drain-flow pathways was higher from the lysimeter which had received naturally enriched maize slurry compared to the lysimeter which received grass slurry indicating a contribution of slurry-derived material. Values of less than 0.7 µm δ\u003csup\u003e13\u003c/sup\u003eC from the same pathway, however, produced counter intuitive trends and may indicate that different fractions of the slurry have different δ\u003csup\u003e13\u003c/sup\u003eC values.","bibo:AuthorList":["Granger, S.R.","Bol, R.","Dixon, L.","Naden, P.S.","Old, G.H.","Marsh, J.K.","Bilotta, G.S.","Brazier, R.E.","White, S.M.","Haygarth, P.M."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":63130,"sim:weight":0.602132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385655,"sim:weight":0.373762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385658,"sim:weight":0.329893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10043,"sim:weight":0.327341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384739,"sim:weight":0.310845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85626,"sim:weight":0.31017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53688,"sim:weight":0.303461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75485,"sim:weight":0.300432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385208,"sim:weight":0.300084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11157,"sim:weight":0.299565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381434,"sim:weight":0.295202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52008,"sim:weight":0.293653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76824,"sim:weight":0.286213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53673,"sim:weight":0.283153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5447763,"sim:weight":0.277416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84241,"sim:weight":0.27574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60624,"sim:weight":0.272105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":359802,"sim:weight":0.268594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1153238,"sim:weight":0.265944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385236,"sim:weight":0.261486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The reasons for doing this have until now been unknown. An analysis of the pith for mineral content showed high levels of sodium to be present in the samples. By contrast, lower levels were found in bark of other tree species, and also in leaf and fruit samples eaten by chimpanzees. The differences between the Raphia samples and the non-Raphia samples were highly significant. It is concluded that Raphia provides a rich and possibly essential source of sodium for the Budongo chimpanzees. Comparison of a chewed sample (wadge) of Raphia pith with a sample from the tree showed a clear reduction in sodium content in the chewed sample. Black and white colobus monkeys in Budongo Forest also feed on the pith of Raphia.

It is seldom possible to rationally justify one’s actions from incontestable first principles nor are there remaining any established conventions or traditions which are not themselves contestable; instead we are responsible for our own choices and cannot rely merely on some other authority (see for instance Sartre, 1948, p. 36-8). This freedom can be regarded either as a wonderful opportunity or a paralysing responsibility or indeed as both.  \r\n\r\nSomething as complex as architecture cannot therefore be determined merely through rational deduction from first principles. But if architecture cannot be determined in this way, how then do designers work?  How can designers appropriately resolve those aspects of what they are designing that are either so under-constrained that it does not matter how they resolve them or so over-constrained that there is no way to resolve them satisfactorily?  Is design necessarily completely subjective?  And how can we deal with the ethical questions that this subjectivity raises?","bibo:AuthorList":["Sweeting, Ben"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The aim was to improve the thermal efficiency of the engine, by extending the lean limit of combustion stability, through promotion of stable charge stratification. The investigation was carried out using a modified 4-valve single cylinder head, derived from a 4-cylinder, pent-roof, production, gasoline engine. The cylinder head was modified by dividing the intake tract into two, separate and isolated passages; each incorporating a production fuel injector. The fuel injection timing and duration were controlled independently for each injector. The performance effects of a single or multiple fuel injection event on a single-sided injector were compared to simultaneous and phased fuel injection for the pair of injectors, with both open valve or closed valve fuel injection timings. A model of the engine, implemented in the Ricardo WAVE software and refined using in-cylinder pressure data, was used to support the findings. The initial experimental results showed good agreement with the model’s prediction and baseline data obtained in a previous study. Analysis of the experimental results for the alternative injection strategies showed that the engine could be operated with far leaner mixtures at low speeds and loads. Combustion stability, defined for a single-cylinder engine as 10% CoVGIMEP, was improved for each engine condition tested. At 1000 rpm and 1.0 bar GIMEP, the lean combustion limit was extended from 14:1 air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) to 17.5:1. At 1500rpm and 1.5 bar GIMEP, the lean combustion limit was extended from 17.5:1 to approximately 21:1 AFR. At 1800 rpm and 1.8 bar GIMEP, the lean combustion limit was improved from 21:1 AFR to 22:1. The improved tolerance of the combustion system to charge dilution, due to the optimised injection strategies, was evaluated for high levels of trapped residuals. The relevance to conditions required for controlled auto-ignition combustion is discussed. Finally, the influence of the new strategies upon the rates of heat release and the combustion duration were evaluated and compared to cycle-resolved measurements of the concentration of unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust gases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Begg, S.M.","Lourenco Cardosa, T.P.","Heikal, M.R."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8561,"sim:weight":0.739054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8168,"sim:weight":0.573368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5595,"sim:weight":0.486738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14440,"sim:weight":0.446883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52556,"sim:weight":0.330781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930626,"sim:weight":0.316619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9378,"sim:weight":0.299553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45512,"sim:weight":0.295622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52085,"sim:weight":0.292531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386560,"sim:weight":0.288627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930216,"sim:weight":0.287975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45139,"sim:weight":0.284884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8636,"sim:weight":0.28028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1388256,"sim:weight":0.272235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45439,"sim:weight":0.268249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52008,"sim:weight":0.266671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.261037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8065,"sim:weight":0.257713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385665,"sim:weight":0.257401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5737,"sim:weight":0.250162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, the effects of injection and in-cylinder pressure on NO formation were investigated temporally and spatially to offer new insight into the formation of NO. Excitation and collection strategies were notably fine-tuned to avoid the collection of spurious signal due to oxygen (O2) fluorescence. NO fluorescence was first recorded slightly after the onset of the diffusion flame and until late in the expansion stroke. The early low levels of NO were located on the lean side of the high density of hydroxyl radicals (OH). The absence of NO inside the flame plume could however not be investigated because of the severe attenuation of the laser light attributed to hot CO2 molecules, intermediate species and soot. The formation rate of nitric oxide was found almost constant during the mixing-controlled combustion, the OH densities were restricted to the upstream part of the flame and moved inwards. High OH densities and high soot densities were not found to coexist. Finally, at the end of fuel injection, the spray collapsed on itself thus resulting in high densities of OH and NO throughout. Some of the NO seemed to be formed after the end of apparent combustion, when OH radicals were not detected. The observed fluorescence signal increase was linked to a rapid cooling of the flame plume and the associated freezing of the thermal NO mechanism. Injection pressure was found to influence the location and extent of regions with high densities of NO, but not the overall formation or width of the flame plume. Raising the in-cylinder pressure from 5 MPa to 7 MPa led to a shorter flame penetration and ignition delay with more NO formed early and in the upstream part of the flame. The plume and flame front width were seen to contract with rising in-cylinder pressure, and higher rates of NO formation could be observed as a result of increased air density and local temperatures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Demory, Romain","Crua, Cyril","Heikal, Morgan"],"dc:date":"2010-05-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8065,"sim:weight":0.617019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6799,"sim:weight":0.539575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83592,"sim:weight":0.494714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6803,"sim:weight":0.444058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":787849,"sim:weight":0.435584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7773,"sim:weight":0.435229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6650,"sim:weight":0.433001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":600453,"sim:weight":0.430513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930216,"sim:weight":0.425531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103660,"sim:weight":0.4114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":378963,"sim:weight":0.406404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91520,"sim:weight":0.405965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220189,"sim:weight":0.402711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":534106,"sim:weight":0.402664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51769,"sim:weight":0.399331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76824,"sim:weight":0.398589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6439,"sim:weight":0.391669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91082,"sim:weight":0.391325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45439,"sim:weight":0.382151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9391,"sim:weight":0.366839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first is to do with the kinds of territories which receive attention in urban spatial discourse and the second focuses on specific problems with existing theories. Using a walk from Mile End tube station to a residence alongside a canal this paper highlights the characteristics of a middle-ground territory between the centre and periphery. It will interrogate various theories and models that have brought together walking and space, ranging from the picturesque promenade to the situationist dérive. The nature of this walk will reveal the shortcomings of these theories, in particular the emphasis on aesthetic motivation or self-consciousness of the walk. Walking through these ‘lost’ territories, forced by necessity, the experience of self and space fits neither the preconception of urban space (based on the model of the historic core) nor the myth of the ‘natural’ or green suburban realm. The paper argues for new models for understanding such spatial territories. Beginning with Michel de Certeau’s concept of walking the suggestion will be for a complex formal-social approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Diaz, Luis"],"dc:date":"2007-08-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931336,"sim:weight":0.248702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65604,"sim:weight":0.229251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103281,"sim:weight":0.194065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930159,"sim:weight":0.191466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75485,"sim:weight":0.179439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76824,"sim:weight":0.175029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631627,"sim:weight":0.174629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930216,"sim:weight":0.173814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.169317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.164834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57855,"sim:weight":0.159088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45439,"sim:weight":0.157147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930842,"sim:weight":0.155984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1928322,"sim:weight":0.147864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386560,"sim:weight":0.14717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2890,"sim:weight":0.141383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49926,"sim:weight":0.139238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2815,"sim:weight":0.136484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":379971,"sim:weight":0.133957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53673,"sim:weight":0.133819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Employing manual measuring and 3D body scanning in conjunction with a digitally enabled knitting system, 3D shaped knitwear has been developed to fit the individual body shape of a cohort of women over UK size 16.  Wearer analysis proves that women value the prototype garment’s comfortable fit, which eliminates stitch distortion whilst reducing the drooping and folding commonly found in ‘outsize’ clothing (Myers McDevitt, 2004:246).  This research employs a widely available Shima Seiki flat bed knitting machine in combination with an SDS1 programmer, creating accessible and transferable outcomes for all systems.\r\nOne of the unique aspects of this research is integrating design with technical knitting skills so that reproduce-able garments are developed with full cognisance of the manufacturing process.  Once the research is completed, the template library of schemata will have international commercial value.  As knitting principles are common, and a universal colour coded language is used, a contribution will be made to the development of a successful dialogue between knitwear designer and technician (Eckert, 1999) towards bespoke or mass customised production.\r\nChapman proposes that consumer/product relationships may contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle (Chapman, 2005); it is possible that custom fitted garments may equally contribute in the clothing market. Additional anecdotal evidence, gathered through a survey carried out during the research, suggests that larger women are keen to embrace a fresh approach to clothing for their size.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haffenden, V M"],"dc:date":"2009-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Abbott and F Sapsford.

This type of heritage is usually located in neighbourhoods among the public, who live and interact with them on a day to day basis. The paper recognises the challenges involved in requiring non-experts to use software and hardware for 3D graphics, which are not yet of common use. Hence, the research has been focused from early stages to gather feedback in order to lower the threshold of 3D technologies. Specifically, this paper addresses the development and use of tools to allow users to create 3D content and integrate it with semantic information. The information is disseminated in a web based format. As a result, the public sculptures and monuments database supports scholar and public dissemination by presenting a variety of integrated documentation on the project website: http://www.publicsculpturesofsussex.co.uk","bibo:AuthorList":["Rodriguez-Echavarria, Karina","Morris, David","Arnold, David"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Wieneke, J Nutzel and D Arnold.

This will be\r\nachieved by implementing biologically inspired Artificial Life (Alife) architectures into their control mechanisms. The method to achieve this is inspired by the constructionist “Synthetic Psychology” approach adopted by neurologist Valentino Braitenberg (Braitenberg 1984). The architecture described in this thought experiment is comprised of a network of functional components and is an abstraction of the neural-architecture of human and mammal brains. The objective of this project is to implement a memoryprediction mechanism (Hawkins and Blakeslee 2004) that will enable virtual characters to behave in unpredictable, unique and interesting ways and allow them to become more sensitive to their environment and events, thus further\r\nsuspending disbelief. \r\nIn addition to proposing a process for creating simulated\r\ncharacters we also aim to evaluate a method of automatically\r\ndetecting emergent behaviours exhibited by characters using\r\nKohonen self-organizing maps (SOM). SOMs have proven\r\nuseful in finding emergent properties in systems from other\r\nfields such as usability analysis, marketing and medicine.\r\nWe believe this capability can assist during the process,\r\nwhich would otherwise require long-term observation for\r\nevaluation. Implemented using Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio 2008, this project will produce a series of prototype virtual “Vehicles” based on the designs found in Braitenberg\u0027s work, but in some cases amended with more recent findings about the neural architecture of the brain as described by Hawkins (Hawkins and Blakeslee 2004), Bonhoeffer (Engert and Bonhoeffer 1999) and Braitenberg himself.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rosenkind, M","Winstanley, G","Blake, A.L."],"dc:date":"2008-11-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Bates.

This paper argues that the incompatibility of the two sets of approaches has been overstated and that there is actually much that each can learn from the other. Cognitive approaches, which have often been accused of offering an effectively individualised, static, and representationalist understanding of organisational knowledge, can benefit from taking on board the practice-based view of knowledge as historically, culturally, and socially situated. However, the paper also suggests that practice-based theories would do well to draw insights from cognitive approaches, particularly regarding the role of cognitive frameworks or schemata in guiding knowledge processes. Without this, practice-based theories struggle to offer a fully developed account of how practices are constituted, reproduced, and potentially transformed through the interplay between routine and reflective action. To provide an example of how cognitive and practice-based approaches can be integrated, the latter part of the paper offers an empirical illustration of how a team of consulting engineers represent and perform alternative schemas of project work through their day-to-day practices. This provides the opportunity to reflect on both the theoretical and methodological challenges of pursuing a rapprochement between practice-based theory and cognitive approaches to organisational knowledge and learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marshall, Nick"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R P Abelson.

This will enable the UK to emerge from the recession in a far stronger position.\r\n\r\nNext-generation, super-fast broadband will be a vital part of the emerging digital economy’s infrastructure, enabling dramatic improvements in connectivity and offering new possibilities for businesses, public services and local communities.\r\n\r\nNESTA estimates that the provision of universal super-fast broadband could directly create 600,000 new ICT jobs, with £18 billion added to GDP. The indirect effects could be far larger. California is an economy approximately the size of the UK – it has been estimated that ultra-fast broadband installation there could add $366 billion to economic output and create two million new jobs.\r\n\r\nBut this fibre-optic infrastructure is expensive, with a baseline cost of universal provision running to £5 billion. NESTA is recommending a radical new deal with the telecommunications industry that will deliver superfast broadband rapidly and at minimal immediate cost to consumers or government.\r\n\r\nOfcom, the communications regulator, should use its powers to provide radio spectrum access rights to communications companies in return for installing a fibre-optic broadband network: a ‘spectrum for speed’ swap. In addition, with intelligent government procurement, this will rapidly deliver the universal super-fast broadband network the UK will need to compete in a digital world.\r\n\r\nAs part of this deal, broadband providers will be required to deliver free, basic broadband services to the most deprived households in the UK.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meadway, James","Mateos-Garcia, Juan"],"dc:date":"2009-01-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":95137,"sim:weight":0.55331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337968,"sim:weight":0.456583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337967,"sim:weight":0.421781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106621,"sim:weight":0.301875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337726,"sim:weight":0.301849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109246,"sim:weight":0.294273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.256871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.25033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.240271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.239499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929836,"sim:weight":0.234942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930155,"sim:weight":0.234096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.231289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.205843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336683,"sim:weight":0.20456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.197247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88494,"sim:weight":0.176942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106809,"sim:weight":0.170458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.153274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83708,"sim:weight":0.141557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The papers and workshops question and employ creativity in many different ways.

Others discuss how creativity may be enhanced or stifled through changes to educational policy or structures, or equally, through theoretical and critical studies or the commercial realities of professional practice.\r\n\r\nThe papers are loosely divided into three strands. The first examines the subject of creativity with reference to overarching themes including entrepreneurship, design management and professional practice, as well as through a number of different disciplinary fields. These papers explore the limitations and opportunities presented by different teaching scenarios and contexts both within and beyond the university. The second strand examines how teaching, learning and research methods and the instruments of evaluation, assessment and curriculum design may be used innovatively, reflectively and creatively to enhance student learning; and the third strand explores questions of creativity, diversity, disability and the implications and opportunities for teachers as well as their students to reflect upon their position in the context of Higher Arts Education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boddington, Anne","Clews, David"],"dc:date":"2007-07","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"present Finally.

The passive scalar tracer is injected\r\ninto the flow field by means of a steady source term. We examine the distribution of the tracer once a periodic state is reached, in which the rate of injected scalar\r\nbalances advection and the molecular diusion kappa. We study the two-dimensional velocity field u(x, y, t) \u003d 2 cos2(omega*t)(0, sin x) + 2 sin2(omega*t)(sin y, 0). As omega is reduced from an O(1) value the flow alternates through a sequence of states which are either globally chaotic, or contain islands embedded in a chaotic sea. The evolution of the scalar is examined numerically using a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme. \r\n\r\nBy time-averaging diagnostics measured from the scalar field we find that the time-averaged length of the scalar contours in the chaotic region grow like kappa^{-1/2} for small kappa, for all values of omega, while the dependence of the time-averaged maximum scalar value, C_max, depends strongly on omega as kappa varies. In the presence of islands C_max is proportional to kappa^{-alpha} for some alpha between 0 and 1 and with kappa small, and we demonstrate that there is a correlation between alpha and the area of the periodic islands, at least for large omega. The limit of small omega is studied by considering a flow field that switches from u \u003d (0, 2 sin x) to u \u003d (2 sin y, 0) at periodic intervals. The small omega limit for this flow is examined using the method of matched asymptotic expansions.\r\n\r\nFinally the role of islands in the flow is investigated by considering the time-averaged effective diffusion of the scalar field. This diagnostic can distinguish between regions where the scalar is well mixed and regions where the scalar builds up.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, M. R.","Thuburn, J.","Gilbert, A.

The response to such a field of given angular frequency depends on the profile of the vortex and can be calculated numerically. An effective diffusivity can be determined as a function of radius and may be used to evolve the profile over a long time scale, using a diffusion equation that\r\nis both nonlinear and non-local. This equation, containing an additional smoothing parameter, is simulated starting with a Gaussian vortex. Fine scale steps in the vorticity profile develop at the periphery of the vortex and these form a vorticity staircase. The effective diffusivity is high in the steps where the vorticity gradient is low: between the steps are barriers characterized by low effective diffusivity and high vorticity gradient. The steps then merge before the vorticity is finally swept out and this leaves a vortex with a compact core and a sharp edge. There is also an increase in the effective diffusion within an encircling surf zone.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the properties of the evolution of the Gaussian vortex, an asymptotic model first proposed by Balmforth, Llewellyn Smith and Young (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 426, 2001, p. 95) is employed. The model is based on a vorticity distribution that consists of a compact vortex core surrounded by a skirt of relatively weak vorticity. Again simulations show the formation of fine scale vorticity steps within the skirt, followed by merger. The diffusion equation we develop has a tendency to generate vorticity steps on arbitrarily fine scales; these are limited in our numerical simulations by smoothing the effective diffusivity over small spatial scales.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, M.

We present results for the position of the lower branch neutral stability point and the magnitude of the unstable Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) mode at this point for both a parabolic body and the Rankine body. For the Rankine body, which has an adverse pressure gradient along its surface far from the nose, we find a double maximum in the T-S wave amplitude for sufficiently large Reynolds numbers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, M.

When the external strain field is smoothly switched off, the\r\ncat\u0027s eyes may persist, or they may disappear as the vortex relaxes back to axisymmetry. A numerical study obtains criteria for the persistence of cat\u0027s eyes as a function of the strength and time-scale of the imposed strain field, for a Gaussian vortex profile.   \r\n\r\nIn the limit of a weak external strain field and high Reynolds number, the disturbance decays exponentially, with a rate that is linked to a Landau pole of the linear inviscid problem. For stronger strain fields, but not strong enough to give persistent cat\u0027s eyes, the exponential decay of the disturbance varies: as time increases the decay slows down, because of the nonlinear feedback on the mean profile of the vortex. This is confirmed by determining the decay rate given by the Landau pole for these modified profiles. For strain fields strong enough to generate persistent cat\u0027s eyes, their location\r\nand rotation rate are determined for a range of angular velocities of the external strain field, and are again linked to Landau poles of the mean profiles, modified through nonlinear effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, M.

In this limit the disturbance decays exponentially in time at a rate that is linked to a pole of the associated linear inviscid problem (known as a Landau pole). As a model of a typical vortex distribution that can give rise to cat\u0027s eyes, here distributions are examined that have a basic Gaussian shape but whose profiles have been artificially flattened about some radius r_c. A numerical study of the Landau poles for this family of vortices shows that as r_c$ is varied so the decay rate of the disturbance moves smoothly between poles as the decay rates of two Landau poles cross.\r\n \r\nCat\u0027s eyes that occur in the nonlinear evolution of a vortex lead to an axisymmetric azimuthally averaged profile with an annulus of approximately uniform vorticity, rather like the artificially flattened profiles investigated. Based on the stability of such profiles it is found that finite thickness cat\u0027s eyes can persist (i.e. the mean profile has a neutral mode) at two distinct radii, and in the limit of a thin flattened region the result that vanishingly thin cat\u0027s eyes only persist at a single radius is recovered. The decay of non--axisymmetric perturbations to these flattened profiles for larger times is investigated and a comparison made with the result for a Gaussian profile.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, M R","Gilbert, A.

Now the vortex is allowed to spread viscously: initially r_ext lies outside the vortex but as it spreads, vorticity is advected into the cat\u0027s eyes, leading to a local flattening of the mean profile of the vortex and so to enhanced mixing and spreading of the vortex. Together with this is a feedback: the response of the vortex to the external strain depends on the modified profile. The feedback  is particularly strong when r_ext coincides with the radius r_cat at which the vortex can support cat\u0027s eyes of infinitesimal width. There is a particular time at which this occurs, as these radii change with the viscous spread of the vortex: r_ext moves inwards and r_cat outwards. This resonance behaviour leads to increased mixing of vorticity, along with a rapid stretching of vorticity contours and a sharp increase in the amplitude of the non--axisymmetric components. \r\n\r\nThe dynamical feedback and enhanced diffusion are studied for viscously spreading vortices by means of numerical simulations of their time evolution, parameterised only by the Reynolds number R and the dimensionless strength A of the external strain field.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, M.

One tool to quantify this is to measure the flux of scalar across contour lines of constant scalar. This gives a diffusion equation in area coordinates with an effective diffusion that depends on the structure of the scalar field, and in particular takes large values when scalar contours become very extended. The present paper studies the properties of this effective diffusion using a mixture of analytical and numerical tools. \r\n\r\nFirst the presence of hyperbolic stationary points, that is saddles, in the scalar concentration field is investigated analytically, and it is shown that these give rise to singular spikes in the effective diffusion. This is confirmed in numerical simulations in which complex scalar fields are generated using a time--periodic flow. Issues of numerical resolution are discussed and results are given on the dependence of the effective diffusion on grid resolution and discretization in area or scalar values. These simulations show complex dependence of the effective diffusion on time, as saddle points appear and disappear in the scalar field. It is found that time--averaging (in the presence of an additional scalar source term) removes this dependence to leave robust results for the effective diffusion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, M.

Three estimates of inviscid thresholds for the formation of satellites are computed and compared: two estimates use qualitative\r\ndiagnostics, the appearance of an infection point or neutral mode in the mean profile.

Titanite and allanite from a range of mineral deposits in the area have been analysed for U–Pb isotope systematics and trace element chemistry using laser ablation quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Analyses of a single sample from the regional scapolite–albite alteration give an age of 1903 ± 8 Ma (2σ) and may be contemporaneous with the early stages of Fe mineralization (1890–1870 Ma). Analyses of titanite and allanite from undeformed IOCG deposits indicate initial alteration at 1862 ± 16 Ma. In many deposits subsequent metamorphic effects reset titanite isotope systematics from 1790 to 1800 Ma, resulting in a spread of U–Pb isotope analyses along concordia. In some instances core regions may record evidence of early thermal events at around 2050 Ma. Titanite and allanite from deformed IOCG deposits on major shear zones record ages from 1785 ± 21 Ma to 1777 ± 20 Ma, corresponding to deformation, metamorphism and secondary hydrothermal alteration as a result of late orogenic movements. The lack of intracrystalline variations in titanite and allanite trace element chemistry suggests that hydrothermal fluid chemistry and metal source were the main controls on mineral trace element chemistry. Titanite from undeformed Fe oxide–apatite and IOCG deposits is typically light rare earth element (LREE) enriched, and shows low U/Th ratios and low Ni in both intermediate to acid and basic volcanic-hosted deposits. This is consistent with a granitic source for metals. Minor variations in trace element patterns are consistent with the influence of aqueous complex formation on relative REE solubility. Deposits related to the Nautanen Deformation Zone have relatively heavy REE (HREE)-enriched titanite, and LREE-depleted allanite, with high U/Th ratios and elevated Ni contents, consistent with leaching of metals from the local basic volcanic rocks. All hydrothermal titanites are high field strength element enriched (Nb, Ta, Zr) indicating their transport as a result of either high salinities or high F contents, or both. The data overall support models of IOCG-type mineralization as a result of regional circulation of saline hydrothermal fluids in association with major crustal structures, with at least some metallic components derived from the granitoid rocks of the area. All the deposits here show evidence of subsequent metamorphism, although penetrative fabrics are restricted to regional-scale deformation zones.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, M.P.","Storey, C.D.","Jeffries, T.E.","Ryan, C."],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M D Barton and D A Johnson.

Although, commercial head-eye trackers offer advantages when compared to Open Source Software (OSS) solutions, their use for research presents the same problem as many proprietary software and hardware: restricted access to data and protocols. To overcome these problems, this paper describes the development of OSS which was designed to be used with either commercial or open source hardware. Particular focus was on designing the software from the ground up, to work with immersive environments. As a result, the Point of Regard (PoR) head-eye tracking software uses an open source library which takes as data input a users\u0027 head position, head orientation and eye data from any device giving the freedom to the developer for manipulating the resulting combined data.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morris, D","Rodriguez-Echavarria, Karina","Arnold, D"],"dc:date":"2008-07","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"KG.

Because of this inherently interdisciplinary character, VR domain can be viewed as a melting pot of various technologies which although complementary are non-trivial to put together. Frameworks can be used to address this challenge as they offer advantages such as reusability of components, as well as easiness of replacements, extensions, and adaptations. Hence, this paper presents developments within the EPOCH project, in particular the Characterize NEWTON, to improve and release frameworks that support the incorporation of avatars in interactive real-time 3D VR systems. The purpose is to enable avatars to be interactive and to react to model metadata; thus adding realism and engaging the user’s interest. This vertical middleware offers the advantage to be based on open source generic frameworks, such as OpenScenegraph and OpenSG as well as offering complementary functionalities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arnold, D.B.","Day, A","Glauert, J","Haegler, S","Jennings, V","Kevelham, B","Laycock, R","Magnenat-Thalmann, N","Maïm, J","Maupu, D","Papagiannakis, G","Thalmann, D","Yersin, B","Rodriguez-Echavarria, Karina"],"dc:date":"2008-02","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J MAÏM, S HAEGLER, B YERSIN, P MUELLER, D THALMANN and L V GOOL.

The view of using ICT contextualisation mechanisms, such as 3D immersive virtual environment, in museums and heritage sites is explored in this research. Hence, this paper describes efforts towards exploring the acceptability of the interfaces and interaction techniques for Virtual Tours.

Hence it is necessary to offer a study package of remedial input to bring them up to the standard required for progression to subsequent years.\r\nIt has become progressively more difficult to achieve the required level of engagement with this study package. The problem came to a head in 2006/7 when most students failed to achieve a pass mark in the phase test used to gauge the success of its assimilation. Hence a programme of action was initiated to improve engagement with the study package as it was delivered, in near real-time, and to reduce the reliance of assessment upon examinations only. Computer moderated quizzes were introduced to stimulate engagement with guided reading materials very soon after those materials were delivered to the students. This new strategy gave pleasing results. The performance of the cohort on the phase test at the end of the material was very much improved. The addition of a ‘Coursework Element’ from the quizzes gave all students a significant lift on their overall marks, and this improved their confidence and gave them encouragement throughout the remainder of the year with their application-oriented studies, which built on this material.","bibo:AuthorList":["Awcock, G.J."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Neroth.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts a 2.8 per cent contraction in UK Gross Domestic Product over 2009, and fears that the world economy could shrink for the first time since the 1930s.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, the economy is projected to experience its worst recession since 1980, shrinking by 0.4 per cent in 2009, before growing again by 1.5 per cent in 2010. At the heart of this recession is the collapse of the financial services industry, with bank failures and nationalisations on a scale not seen for decades. New, tighter regulations on financial institutions are being imposed worldwide in response.\r\n\r\nBut these finance and business service industries were central to the UK\u0027s relative prosperity, fuelling economic growth and providing hundreds of thousands of jobs. From 2000 to 2007, financial services added 15 per cent to annual GDP growth.\r\n\r\nBut finance will not save us in the future. The challenge facing the UK economy is now to find the new sources of growth that will drive prosperity over the coming years. The knock-on effects of the global financial crisis are hitting Britain\u0027s non-financial businesses hard. Reduced business lending and lower spending is hitting British industry, sparking a chain reaction of distress, with industries from car manufacturers to shoe-makers seeking government help.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish Government has identified long-term challenges to Scotland\u0027s economy and society. These include boosting Scotland\u0027s growth, productivity, population and participation, and in delivering on the desired characteristics of growth - solidarity, cohesion and sustainability.Sitting idly by in the face of the worst recession of modern times is not an option. But bailing out industries piecemeal is no better.\r\n\r\nA coordinated approach is clearly preferable. The trouble, however, is that ‘industrial policy\u0027 carries with it a heavy history. It is redolent of failed attempts to boost post-war British manufacturing, a process of ‘picking winners\u0027 that rarely came good.\r\n\r\nNESTA argues that there is a better option.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meadway, James","Mateos-Garcia, Juan"],"dc:date":"2009-03-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":8173,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Other","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Demanding Growth: Why the UK needs a recovery plan based on growth and innovation","bibo:abstract":"Recovery from the recession will require an imaginative approach from government. Traditional intervention policies have sought to prop up old industries. But such short-term fixes will not produce long-term growth. Instead, government policy should focus on innovation and growth, supporting innovative sectors that have the potential for strong growth once the recovery begins. It is a move away from corrective intervention towards creative intervention.\r\n\r\nActing decisively and intelligently is necessary to transform an economy that had become unduly reliant on financial services. This is not about a return to post-war industrial policy, where government tried to ‘pick winners\u0027. Rather it is about being willing to create the conditions in which innovation can flourish.\r\n\r\nThese conditions will include the development of networks and may mean a degree of cooperation rather than competition initially. There are good examples of where such a policy has worked. The Finnish telecommunications industry, including Nokia, grew from a national economic strategy developed in the recession which followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. In Britain, defence equipment is developed through a planned market approach which helps to develop the latest military hardware. Even the growth of Silicon Valley as the hub of international IT was partly a spin-off from the subsidised American defence industries.\r\n\r\nOur response to the recession should not seek to build national champions. But it should support new areas of emerging demand, where important long-term trends are giving rise to new markets. Three areas for potential growth are especially promising: the green economy; creative industries; and healthcare, including services for an ageing society and biotechnology.\r\n\r\nNESTA believes that these are all areas of high future demand, significant existing strengths, and strong technological changes. The green economy and healthcare could have a combined market size of £93 billion by 2013, with the creative industries alone contributing £85 billion to GDP.\r\n\r\nSuccess in these areas requires the government to support and empower businesses through a combination of infrastructure development, regulation that actively encourages growth, and the use of government procurement to stimulate demand.\r\n\r\nProcurement, in particular, is successfully used to support innovative small businesses in countries like South Korea and the United States. Such a recovery plan can deliver good results at relatively low cost, provided it is well-targeted. Upgrading our broadband network would cost a third of the price of a third runway at Heathrow.\r\n\r\nCarefully targeting existing funding would transform the environment for industries in the three targeted areas. In the Appendix, we show how a very specific targeting at one creative industry, videogames, could help create new jobs with extra investment, tax credits and education, at an extra cost of just over £15 million. We estimate that this sort of support, across the creative industries, could help create over 100,000 new jobs by 2013.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meadway, James","Mateos-Garcia, Juan"],"dc:date":"2009-03-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In parallel with middle aged women, women of size 16 and above find clothes shopping fruitless, and frustrating. Consequently both bigger and or older women become excluded from their peer group and disregarded by fashion. Consideration is also given to the psychological affects of larger body size. This research addresses these issues in the practical context of knitwear.\r\nOne significant finding of this research is that larger and or older women’s response is to look to custom made clothing. Towards this end, garment templates in an internationally transferable format have been created to facilitate the possibilities of bespoke production within the European Union.\r\nA pilot study has culminated in a capsule collection of prototype garments and contributed to the development and inception of a main study.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haffenden, Vikki"],"dc:date":"2007-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":378011,"sim:weight":0.392933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5995,"sim:weight":0.343293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5628,"sim:weight":0.313905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":534106,"sim:weight":0.301957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8306,"sim:weight":0.29318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6603,"sim:weight":0.289142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385655,"sim:weight":0.273053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83592,"sim:weight":0.267337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65922,"sim:weight":0.251798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9309,"sim:weight":0.239917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26803,"sim:weight":0.237364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29563,"sim:weight":0.23694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8502,"sim:weight":0.231741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77000,"sim:weight":0.231622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":600453,"sim:weight":0.231269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930216,"sim:weight":0.230643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28288,"sim:weight":0.228753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91520,"sim:weight":0.22711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384632,"sim:weight":0.226674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":487518,"sim:weight":0.221678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I argue that recognition should be given to laughter and humour as both a conscious reflective strategy and a `nonrepresentational\u0027 embodied and contagious phenomenon, for laughter and humour are intimately connected both to the subject positions of walkers with visual impairments and to the embodied, muscular practice of walking itself. I note that, while humour is a useful individual coping strategy that gives people with blindness a sense of liberation from a notion of `the blind\u0027 as subjects of pity, laughter and humour can also betray a certain pessimism, sometimes used as a way of coping with, rather than actually challenging, some of the subtle prejudices that they face as users of rural space.","bibo:AuthorList":["Macpherson, H.M."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Agyeman and R Spooner.

For instance the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) recently published its curriculum map for introducing ethics into the engineering curriculum for courses that do not explicitly cover this at present. The guidelines include a suggested three step approach, including an audit of current methods, a plan of action for the future and the implementation of the plan. The authors are attempting to begin the process of introducing ethics into its engineering and product design courses using these three stages. Currently, the team is about to enter the final and potentially most challenging stage of the process. This paper is presented as a case study, giving an overview and evaluation of the experiences of this team thus far, with reference to other case studies from overseas and our own experiences in the UK.","bibo:AuthorList":["Covill, D","Singh Gill, D","Katz, T","Morris, R","Boks, C","McMahon, C","Ion, W","Parkinson, B"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K Humphreys.

A database of student videocasts can encourage a community approach in learning, where students can learn from the knowledge, tips, dead ends, tricks and approaches of their peers.   Practical issues associated with the use of online teaching material and assessment methods are included.

When comparing respondents with one or more adult children, there was no significant\r\ndifference in the likelihood of experiencing familial isolation between people living in single person households and those living in larger households. A majority of those living in single person households had at least regular contact with a sibling, adult child or close friend and participated in a social organisation. Friends compensate to some extent for a lack of support from the family, although in southern and eastern European countries, other relatives appeared to be more important in support networks. People living in single person households were more likely to experience isolation, but this was largely related to advanced age and childlessness. Whilst a very small minority in Japan were living in single person households, they were significantly more likely to be severely isolated than those living in single person households in other countries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Banks, Laura","Haynes, P.","Hill, Michael"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5084149,"sim:weight":0.290823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.274364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15476,"sim:weight":0.272886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160271,"sim:weight":0.266006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65922,"sim:weight":0.258678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931336,"sim:weight":0.250952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930842,"sim:weight":0.246037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586072,"sim:weight":0.245933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.244726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5447770,"sim:weight":0.244324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1924421,"sim:weight":0.238619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5447763,"sim:weight":0.23185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5447789,"sim:weight":0.226837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197558,"sim:weight":0.22604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9429093,"sim:weight":0.205896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18009,"sim:weight":0.203348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":728897,"sim:weight":0.20274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":758551,"sim:weight":0.20274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082258,"sim:weight":0.196786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1925566,"sim:weight":0.194309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The current global recession will likely increase this trend still further.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rush, Howard","Smith, Chris","Kraemer-Mbula, Erika","Tang, Puay"],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1512571,"sim:weight":0.650936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43295,"sim:weight":0.544965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5065605,"sim:weight":0.537826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.535608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.53514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96261,"sim:weight":0.533646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665713,"sim:weight":0.530367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225496,"sim:weight":0.522093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.512374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":991456,"sim:weight":0.512023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1083769,"sim:weight":0.507959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.505121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.495899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931685,"sim:weight":0.488591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187782,"sim:weight":0.48493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.481797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826872,"sim:weight":0.472102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89658,"sim:weight":0.445934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98865,"sim:weight":0.440103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":901911,"sim:weight":0.432921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Warming of these joints in rock can lead to instabilities and rockfall events. In the following study, a series of direct shear tests was performed with artificial samples simulating ice-filled rock joints. The direct shear tests were carried out in two testing modes: constant strain and constant stress. In constant stress tests, the ice-filled joints show a parabolic relationship between normal stress and shear stress unlike the linear relationship usually found in mineral filled rock joints (Barton 1974). Constant stress tests were also conducted in which the samples were allowed to warm up until failure occurred while a constant normal stress and a constant shear test were applied. Different failure modes could be identified, either driven by breaking the connection of ice and concrete or ductile deformation of the ice or a combination of both.","bibo:AuthorList":["Günzel, F.K."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2003).

It relies on the concept of absorptive capacity and the recent advances in its understanding, specifically the distinction between a potential absorptive capacity and a realised absorptive capacity. The paper calls for differentiating between the de facto absorptive capacity, which is taken by firms usually without the consent of the other party and the de jure absorptive capacity which is taking place in the context of ‘rightful’ arrangements between different firms such as strategic alliances, clusters or learning networks. \r\n\r\nRelying on the qualitative investigation of two fully-fledged learning networks in Ireland, the paper identifies the factors which can have an impact on the de jure absorptive capacity at least in small firms. The individual in the interface between the firm and the network, the degree of alignment with the network resources allocation process, the participation to network ground activities and the ‘no fear to fail’ culture in the organisation of the receiving firm have proved to be critical in regulating the de jure absorptive capacity. The paper calls for a better understanding of the de jure absorptive capacity, which can have profound implications for both organisational behaviour and policy-making.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tsekouras, George","McGovern, Philip","Brady, Tim"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"JB Barney.

It is the conceptualisation by which the firm’s top managers not only identify and understand these, but by which they assign them worth within a wider corporate strategy. In our analysis, we consider how the frame can influence – and be influenced by – patterns in the firm’s technology inputs, outputs and\r\nultimately its operating performance. Using the top 10 integrated oil companies active in the upstream petroleum industry, we test the frame as a heuristic for interpreting the patterns in R\u0026amp;D expenditure, patenting, publications and operating performance metrics according to predicted effects. The panel-data econometric evidence supports most of the predicted effects, with the exceptions arguably affected by longer-term trends or by interesting divergences\r\nbetween firm views and employee behaviours. We conclude that there is evidence to support our view that technology frames matter because they set the boundaries in which firms plan and act, and they provide us with one means of conceptualising ‘routines’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Acha, V.","Von Tunzelnann, G.N."],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(1982).

De-regulation of the industry and rapid technological change have increased competition and changed the cost base of the industry. Major customers are going global and they want to source from key suppliers on a global basis. They want telecommunications services delivered end-to-end with guaranteed service levels. To begin with this involved C\u0026amp;W offering managed services, then later to providing network outsource, and on to providing IT and network outsource, and finally on to applications service provision as the gap between networks and computer operations closes. The advent of the Internet facilitated this globalisation process. \r\nC\u0026amp;W has faced this challenge by completely re-organising itself. It has withdrawn from some markets such as mobile, residential and entertainment services to the public in order to focus solely on business-to-business customers. The rest of the paper describes these changes in the organisation, what C\u0026amp;W has learnt along the way, and how they tried to capture and transfer this learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brady, Tim","Cobb, John","Davies, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":113814,"sim:weight":0.529219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46163,"sim:weight":0.496218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.478381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.476597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.439109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101228,"sim:weight":0.435702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46637,"sim:weight":0.433907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.431638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.431204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44479,"sim:weight":0.426606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.426578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.414862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.411076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.4095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383501,"sim:weight":0.371506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.275826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.20942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":134,"sim:weight":0.196543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.160895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109246,"sim:weight":0.155302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper explores this paradox through an empirical study of practices and routines in the Electronic Games Development Industry (EGDI) in the UK and USA. Conventional wisdom suggests that UK games developers lag behind their USA counterparts in managing the creative process. The paper identifies and analyses observed differences in practice between British and American developers. Moreover the paper also shows considerable similarities in behaviour and in the adoption of newer practice across the two countries.

{"identifier":8262,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Double Brides: narratives of desire in the ‘wedding dresses’ of lesbian couples after the Civil Partnership Act UK, 2004.","bibo:abstract":"This paper seeks to activate a particular fashioned garment (a bronze lamé cocktail dress from 1952), with its own set of fictions (constructed as recounted memories), narratives (related through a photographic record of its original wearer) and mythologies (as conjured through the particular symbolic meaning of specific contexts), to bring new critical-creative understanding to a contemporary story.\r\n\r\nThe Partnership Act 2004 (UK) permitted same-sex ‘marriages’, and in September 2006 my partner and I enacted our ‘special day’. With two ‘brides’, the ‘wedding dress(es)’ became material sites of self-identification and mediated contestation. My partner, at the last moment, refused her shop-bought frock for a cocktail dress owned by her mother and worn to her mother’s sister’s wedding in 1952. The layers of significance captured in this dress were considerable – it had been created specially for this woman’s sister’s wedding, and its use as a means by which a working class woman from London became regal and filmic just for a day are captured in a black and white photograph from the wedding reception. This image in turn finds numerous reflections in the imaging and construction of post-War womanhood through fashion, film and popular cultural references in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These tell a broader tale of fashion culture’s reconfiguration of women as elegant, glamorous, ‘womanly’ after the confusion of gender roles, and their silhouettes, during the war years. \r\n\r\nMy role in September 2006 became that of a seamstress, charged with making good a dress falling apart at the seams. These acts of repair took place before and during the celebrations, and the dress took on a key significance in marking, documenting, investigating and explaining the significance and meaning of our day with its own constructed fictions, narratives and mythologies. As a ‘text’, the dress documented the slippages of gender role, glamour, and ‘womanliness’ our story enacted\r\n\r\nUsing material cultural concepts and ideologies variously mobilised via Burman’s The Culture of Sewing (1999), my maternal grandmother’s whitework embroidery, and Gober’s Untitled (Bridal Photo) (1996), this paper examines how the sewing of a garment – previously used in my family to enact the discipline, frugality and virtue of Northern Irish Presbyterianism – was used here to (re)construct (queer) femininity. The dress, already invested with the perceived decadence of 1950s London, tempered with the respectability of my partner’s mother’s successful role as wife and mother, is relocated on a lesbian body, thereby reconfiguring its constructed meanings of the feminine. Yet, by being configured as a bridal gown, this garment re-entered the feminine normative, only to quick skip away as the ‘groom’ gets revealed as a ‘second bride’. \r\n\r\nThe tendency of the dress to fall apart throughout the ‘marriage’ day, and to require repeated mending, set up a dynamic of fixity and slippage, with sewing being the act of temporary anchorage in a field of uncertainty. The tight, white stitching, taught by my puritanical grandmother (a keen homophobe within her generation and context), was re-activated in the subversive construction of a ‘lesbian bride’. \r\n\r\nBut, and to continue to trouble the normative, just as most grooms work hard to eagerly unlace the body, this female ‘groom’ laboured to sew up the gaps where flesh threatened to emerge…","bibo:AuthorList":["Harper, Catherine"],"dc:date":"2007-05-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103271,"sim:weight":0.245675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8260,"sim:weight":0.215898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.195391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16699,"sim:weight":0.184183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15239,"sim:weight":0.175822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.17511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2829,"sim:weight":0.171972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386224,"sim:weight":0.166987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2860,"sim:weight":0.166418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2916,"sim:weight":0.161089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.160395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2928,"sim:weight":0.147128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.132594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101450,"sim:weight":0.124185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77048,"sim:weight":0.122845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4484,"sim:weight":0.121307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2826,"sim:weight":0.116087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9840,"sim:weight":0.114236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16761,"sim:weight":0.113797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2907,"sim:weight":0.102834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

If one’s well-being is bound to absolute somatic and psychic pleasure, then fur’s material fetish - its tactile, visual and olfactory stimulation, coupled with its generous allowance for the fetish-purist’s idealized disavowal – offers precisely the heady mix of sex, sadism, seduction and sensuality that keeps fur both perennially attractive and ascendant in the fashion industry. \r\n\r\nThis paper examines how fur worn on the body dynamically co-joins the fetishistic disavowing pleasure of its rich surface with the overt deliberateness of suffering at its point of production, arguing that fur fabric manages to perform this oscillation between the disclaimer of the fur fetishist and the de-fetishized knowingness of the fur sadist, corrupting both in its insinuation that the deep and complex perversion of Western fur appreciation lies in the fetishist’s obverse acceptance of the ‘attraction of repulsion’, the oftentimes inversion of the traditional male fetishist in the legions of fur-wearing femme fatales, and the Sapphic implications of such femmes’ somatic insertion into the fur that still is inflected as female genitalia. Underpinning the paper’s concern with the ecstatic pleasure of the stroke of soft pelt passing across skin, the paper questions the how knowing acceptance of agony, disavowing desire for the sex-death nexus, critical subordination of emotion and empathy informs the fashioning of a certain form of well-being while peeling the skin off another.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harper, Catherine"],"dc:date":"2009-04-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.296205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46776,"sim:weight":0.289683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44304,"sim:weight":0.286882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.28434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.276605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.273663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352208,"sim:weight":0.267138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383599,"sim:weight":0.263129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101523,"sim:weight":0.258488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45867,"sim:weight":0.258351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48343,"sim:weight":0.258109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.257492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.255794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383589,"sim:weight":0.252351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.243433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.243321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.242841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48412,"sim:weight":0.235841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381913,"sim:weight":0.235665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45831,"sim:weight":0.22905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper describes the process of financial negotiation and the impact of financial considerations in four UK multicentre trials. These trials had met, or were on schedule to meet, recruitment targets agreed with their public-sector funders. The trials were considered within a larger study examining factors which might be associated with trial recruitment (STEPS).\r\nMETHODS - In-depth semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted in 2003–04 with 45 individuals with various responsibilities to one of the four trials. Interviewees were recruited through purposive and then snowball sampling. Interview transcripts were analysed with the assistance of the qualitative package Atlas-ti.\r\nRESULTS - The data suggest that the UK system of dividing funds into research, treatment and NHS support costs brought the trial teams into complicated negotiations with multiple funders. The divisions were somewhat malleable and the funding system was used differently in each trial. The fact that all funders had the potential to influence and shape the trials considered here was an important issue as the perspectives of applicants and funders could diverge. The extent and range of industry involvement in non-industry-led trials was striking. Three broad periods of financial work (foundation, maintenance, and resourcing completion) were identified. From development to completion of a trial, the trialists had to be resourceful and flexible, adapting to changing internal and external circumstances. In each period, trialists and collaborators could face changing costs and challenges. Each trial extended the recruitment period; three required funding extensions from MRC or HTA.\r\nCONCLUSION - This study highlights complex financial aspects of planning and conducting trials, especially where multiple funders are involved. Recognition of the importance of financial stability and of the need for appropriate training in this area should be paralleled by further similar research with a broader range of trials, aimed at understanding and facilitating the conduct of clinical research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Snowdon, Claire","Elbourne, Diana R.","Garcia, Jo","Campbell, Marion K.","Entwistle, Vikki A.","Francis, David","Grant, Adrian M.","Knight, Rosemary C.","MacDonald, Alison M.","Roberts, Ian"],"dc:date":"2006-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Health, Attributing revenue costs of externally-funded","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"Health, Attributing revenue costs of externally-funded"},{"rawReferenceText":"I Chalmers, C Rounding and K Lock.

Examples of such configurations can be found in regional clusters, in sector groupings, in heterogeneous groups sharing a common topic of interest, in user groups concerned with learning around a particular technology or application and in supply chain learning.  Although there is clear potential in such shared learning and some evidence of its being achieved in a few cases it is clear that learning in such configurations does not take place automatically. This paper addresses some of the management challenges involved in setting up and nurturing learning networks. It draws particularly on case examples of learning networks in operation in the automotive components and timber products industries in South Africa.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bessant, John","Barnes, Justin","Morris, Mike","Kaplinsky, Raphael"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99444,"sim:weight":0.504701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.497316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.494245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.46827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.464933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.42191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.416693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.400722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.390255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.377308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.371782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.363516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.354116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.348699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383501,"sim:weight":0.345014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46637,"sim:weight":0.34131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.324939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.318921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.305621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77362,"sim:weight":0.304616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Crucial to this claim is the belief that mobile devices are becoming increasingly integral to the lives of users – whether for work or leisure, and that they are inherently transformative. Their ‘always-on’ connectivity and increasing processing [1] power and capabilities distinguishes them from other ICTs. Their functionality goes beyond voice and data transfer. Their potential for identity confirmation and networking, for example, is unmatched – though there are considerable dangers. These include, amongst others, involuntary exclusion, surveillance, privacy, accountability and the need for openness. In many cases these are political questions that cannot be left to the market.","bibo:AuthorList":["Grantham, Andrew","Tsekouras, George"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Bell.

The use of ICTs within organisations of all types is approaching ubiquity with many such systems being viewed as mission critical. This spread and the increasing criticality of such systems itself relies upon the ability to develop complex software systems in a reliable and predictable fashion. However, there is widespread evidence that the development of software in such a fashion continues to present a formidable challenge to many organisations with software typically being delivered late, over budget and with reduced functionality.\r\n\r\nWhilst large software projects have always posed huge challenges for suppliers of bespoke software, the nature and scale of that challenge has evolved over the years. At the level of the individual firm, modern information systems development takes place in the context of a series of interconnected complexities concerning alignment with organisational goals, primary and secondary sourcing, integration of new systems and backward integration with existing systems. At the level of the industry, these complexities are in turn managed in the context in which specialist capability has largely migrated to the IT services industry, necessitating the involvement of a range of intermediaries. Such work takes place within the wider context of a range of highly flexible technologies with high rates of technical and skill obsolescence. Within this turbulent situation data across a range of performance metrics may be difficult or impossible to obtain with the result that organisations will often operate in the absence of reliable information.\r\n\r\nThis exploratory paper will provide a high-level examination of the major challenges associated with the development of large-scale complex software systems and trace the emergence of the current situation facing many organisations. In order to provide a context for the discussion, the paper will examine the recent growth and development of the software and computer services industry and draw on earlier work that assesses its maturity (Flowers and Brady, 2001). The development of complex sourcing for IT (Venkatraman, 1997) and the rapid growth and expanding role of intermediaries within the software industry will also be examined.\r\n\r\nThe nature and implications of the migration of specialist capability within the IT and software industry will be explored and the paper will build on earlier work in the area (Feeny and Willcocks, 1998) to argue that there has been the emergence of a series of capability gaps, traps and overlaps that provide a further layer of sourcing complexity to what is already a hugely complex procurement and development context. The issues and implications of this situation will be examined and it will be argued that the emergence of significant capability imbalances against the background of poor data provide the context for the continued uneven performance of complex software projects. The paper will conclude with an examination of the implications of this situation to the development of complex software projects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flowers, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"AGC.

She knows that the time invested in the creation of such delicate and exquisite works demands reciprocal time from a viewer. She knows the emotive value of the painstaking labour apparent in her stitched pictures. She knows that, having seduced her viewer with the delicate materiality of her work, she can deliver more robust fare.  Note then that her miniscule stitches are not always conventionally ordered in the same direction, but rather move in one direction and then against that grain, though always against the rectilinear order of the base fabric. Use this a clue that, in Jubelin’s work, textile convention (the ordered warp and weft of fabric) is matched against textile ‘un-convention’ or even self-conscious ‘poor craft’. Note that a frame may be overwhelmingly heavy or oppressive or dark. Consider the implications of this for the focus of ‘the work’ or the relation of the textile to the mechanism which constrains it. Note that the subject-matter is, for example, the Centennial Tree where Australia was proclaimed part of the British Empire, but see that the mood is studious rather than celebratory. Note that the staging of her works, always in groups, operational like linguistic signs (dots, brackets, phrases), ‘speaks’ a complex narrative of difference and misfit. Check one’s sense then of unease and discomfort and question why something as seemingly innocuous as an embroidery can be so affective.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harper, Catherine"],"dc:date":"2003-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46611,"sim:weight":0.350731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.348474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48412,"sim:weight":0.337098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.331455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.328081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.323441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47204,"sim:weight":0.318394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48270,"sim:weight":0.314922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.307439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.302823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46639,"sim:weight":0.293631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.29224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.290433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.286691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44804,"sim:weight":0.280243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.278949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.270035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.269399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352240,"sim:weight":0.261494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.254846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Theoretically it draws on the path creation and path dependence literature, with its proclivity towards structuration theory. Empirically it analyses four case studies of video games developers, which are innovating within two distinct genres: First-Person Shooters and Social Games. The study shows how organisational practice and routines play an important role in supporting genre. They direct the nature and pace of innovation, while maintaining the genre’s constraints. Conversely, when starting new paths, disembedding from prior practice and replacing it is critical. Upsets and shocks that are associated with dysfunctional practice can guide decisions to start new paths and new genres. While developers are constrained by the expectations of publishers, users, and content owners, what they do in terms of management practice affects the received structures and contributes to the reproduction of genres.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sapsed, Jonathan","Mateos-Garcia, Juan","Grantham, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.509426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.437807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.429973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.422296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.412809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.408387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.406355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88939,"sim:weight":0.39493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.371839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.367204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.361444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.346655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45332,"sim:weight":0.307778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98491,"sim:weight":0.222554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312597,"sim:weight":0.214335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83262,"sim:weight":0.173824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.15877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2820,"sim:weight":0.142737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.140537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71875,"sim:weight":0.140396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It\r\nincludes a review of the literature on polymer degradation mechanisms with particular\r\nemphasis on environmental degradation from ultra violet radiation.\r\nProducts manufactured from recycled polyolefin blends were subjected to accelerated\r\nweathering conditions and subsequent tests. Field–aged products were tested also.\r\nSamples were analyzed for changes in mechanical, rheological and chemical properties.\r\nScanning Electron Microscopy and Electron Probe Microanalysis were used to examine\r\nsamples for both impurities and signs of degradation.\r\nData obtained in this study, by means of tensile and melt flow tests, with GPC, gloss and\r\ncolour analyses carried out by Rapra1, showed that the effect of UV exposure, whether in\r\nthe field or artificial environments, was not significant as far as the mechanical properties\r\nof the materials were concerned. There was some change in the surface characteristics but\r\nsuch surface effects would not compromise the mechanical integrity of the product when\r\nrecycled.\r\nDuring reprocessing of the materials, it is likely that stabilizer is brought to the surface of\r\nany new moulding, thus renewing the surface characteristics. Hence damaged or end-oflife\r\nproducts need not be discounted from recycling. However, surface appearance may be\r\nan issue.\r\nSEM EDX Analysis was useful in identifying impurities in the recyclate, but there was no\r\nconclusive evidence of degradation as a direct result of exposure to UV radiation.\r\nThe variation in field-aged materials and the artificially aged materials showed that it is\r\nlikely that the difference in results for field aged and artificially aged material was due to\r\nvariability in the source materials and showed that in practice, it is difficult to control the\r\ncomposition of the mix coming from the waste suppliers. This was more significant for the\r\n1\r\nproperties of the materials than any UV exposure. This increase could be due to\r\ndegradative cross-linking. However, it was more likely to be caused by variability in the\r\nbatches of raw material.\r\nChain scission in polypropylene and cross–linking in polyethylene in mixed blends could\r\nhave a compensating effect on each other and lead to non–degradative effects although\r\nevidence for this was inconclusive.\r\nOverall, the study has shown that all the materials tested have generally maintained their\r\nmechanical properties with little change under accelerated UV exposure. This has positive\r\nimplications for the use of plastic recyclate of this nature in manufacturing processes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Julienne Carol, Attwood"],"dc:date":"2007-08-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1051585,"sim:weight":0.293771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270734,"sim:weight":0.26663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":878141,"sim:weight":0.243433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":772003,"sim:weight":0.239122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.226066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46973,"sim:weight":0.224015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46609,"sim:weight":0.223703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98459,"sim:weight":0.221545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26627,"sim:weight":0.217267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101474,"sim:weight":0.215583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386814,"sim:weight":0.213073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930233,"sim:weight":0.212362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632012,"sim:weight":0.208238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101355,"sim:weight":0.208097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.206762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102703,"sim:weight":0.204374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271236,"sim:weight":0.204025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98474,"sim:weight":0.2032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101264,"sim:weight":0.198645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45932,"sim:weight":0.190819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The system essentially used a fuzzy logic derived relief map of the test route and this was further validated and corrected based on the past trajectory from the GPS sensor. The information was then processed and translated in order to estimate the future elevation of the vehicle. Experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of the system for potential application in vehicle control for reduced fuel consumption and emissions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, S.H.","Walters, S.D.","Howlett, R.J."],"dc:date":"2008-09-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2007).

This has led to negative outcomes such as delays in delivery, low quality products and overshot budgets. In this paper, set in the empirical context of video game development, we present and analyse the Agile Programming Paradigm, an approach to the organisation of software projects that has recently emerged as an alternative to traditional, formal project management and organisation methodologies. The proponents of Agile advocate a bottom-up approach to management with an emphasis on constant product iterations and interaction with customers. They argue that a shift in attention from processes, documentation and measurement to ‘softer’ variables supports a development system better able to ‘embrace change’, which is understood as the\r\nkey limitation of formal, rational methods. We use emerging analyses of ‘organisational becoming’ first advanced by Tsoukas and Chia (2002) in order to frame our discussion theoretically, suggesting that the Agile Paradigm constitutes a potential answer to a key question formulated during their research, ‘what must organisation(s) be like if change is constitutive of reality’. In the empirical part of the paper we present three case studies of organisations that have implemented Agile techniques. This analysis informs a subsequent discussion where we assess the advantages and limitations of the Agile Paradigm. We conclude with an interpretation of our findings within the ‘Organisational Becoming’ philosophical framework.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mateos-Garcia, Juan","Sapsed, Jonathan"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930987,"sim:weight":0.57983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.524149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933113,"sim:weight":0.470156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.418859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.407756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48424,"sim:weight":0.40252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.402331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101625,"sim:weight":0.397306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44432,"sim:weight":0.397197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.390692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.385346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.384059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.381291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.380119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.378798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.378798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46637,"sim:weight":0.375371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.372114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.34817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45163,"sim:weight":0.347375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It suggests that \u0027emotion work\u0027 should be viewed not simply as an analyst resource of use to social scientists, but also as a participant resource used by ordinary social members.  Existing research on emotion work generally treats self-report data as offering a \u0027transparent\u0027 window through which the behaviour \u0027behind the talk\u0027 can be (more or less adequately) assessed.  This paper proposes instead that self-report data should be considered as talk-in interaction. Using data from our own research on young women\u0027s experiences of refusing sex, we show how young women\u0027s talk about (what analysts call) \u0027emotion work\u0027 can be analysed as a participant resource through which young women construct consensual versions of men as emotional weaklings, and portray themselves as active agents who are knowledgeable about heterosecual relationships. The implications of this analytic shift are explored in relation to feminist appraoches to sexual coercion, and with reference to qualitative data analysis more generally.","bibo:AuthorList":["Frith, Hannah","Kitzinger, Celia"],"dc:date":"1998-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"H Frith and C Kitzinger.

In order to accurately evaluate probabilistic characteristics of the seismic response of structures, the Monte Carlo simulation technique is still the only universal method of analysis when strong nonlinearities and input uncertainties are involved. Consequently, realizations of ground motion time histories taking into account both time and spatial variability need to be generated. Furthermore, for some design applications, the generated time histories must also satisfy the provision imposed by certain seismic codes stating that they have to be also response-spectrum-compatible. For these purposes, a spectral-representation-based methodology for generating fully non-stationary and spectrum-compatible ground motion vector processes at a number of locations on the ground surface is proposed in this paper. The simulated time histories do not require any iterations on the individual generated sample functions so that Gaussianity and prescribed coherence are suitably preserved. The methodology has also the advantage of providing the fully non-stationary and spectrum-compatible cross-spectral density matrix of the ground motion time-histories that can be used for reliability studies in an analytic stochastic fashion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cacciola, P.","Deodatis, G."],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H Hao and X N Duan.

The free-stream is assumed to be incompressible, high Reynolds number flow parallel to the chord of the body, with a small, unsteady, perturbation of a single harmonic frequency. We present a method which calculates Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) wave amplitudes downstream of the leading edge, by a combination of an asymptotic receptivity approach in the leading edge region and a numerical method which marches through the Orr-Sommerfeld region. The asymptotic receptivity analysis produces a three deck eigenmode which, in its far downstream limiting form, produces an upstream initial condition for our numerical Parabolized Stability\r\nEquation (PSE).\r\n\r\nDownstream T-S wave amplitudes are calculated for the flat plate, and good comparisons are found with the Orr-Sommerfeld asymptotics available in this region. The\r\nimportance of the O(Re^{−1/2} ) term of the asymptotics is discussed, and, due to the complexity in calculating this term, we show the importance of numerical methods in the\r\nOrr-Sommerfeld region to give accurate results.\r\n\r\nWe also discuss the initial transients present for certain parameter ranges, and show that their presence appears to be due to the existence of higher T-S modes in the initial\r\nupstream boundary condition.\r\n\r\nExtensions of the receptivity/PSE method to the parabola and the Rankine body are considered, and a drop in T-S wave amplitudes at lower branch is observed for both bodies,\r\nas the nose radius increases. The only exception to this trend occurs for the Rankine body at very large Reynolds numbers, which are not accessible in experiments, where a\r\ndouble maximum of the T-S wave amplitude at lower branch is observed.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the receptivity/PSE method to experimentally realistic bodies is also considered, by using slender body theory to model the inviscid flow around a modified super ellipse to compare with numerical studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, M.

The main objective of this network is to support the understanding of both worlds, providing training and facilitating knowledge acquisition of the domain from all perspectives, improving methodologies and techniques to fit better with the needs of the users, and debating new ways to introduce and use technology in CH that fits with the needs of the CH institutions. The methodology known as Learning Network integrates action learning techniques with the network approach producing a very powerful mechanism for sharing knowledge between different organisations. The vision is to create a network of centres, organized in a Europe-wide network, integrating a number of local CH and ICT institutions, policymakers, companies, research institutions and other stakeholders with a regional mission to improve the sector. The paper will further discuss the lessons learned, successes and challenges encountered during the implementation of the network.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kanellou, Despina","Grantham, Andrew","Rodriguez-Echavarria, Karina"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C Argyris and D A Schön.

The basic assumption is that the measurement of the real impact of Information and Communication Technologies on organisational forms and functions require the identification of the routines and everyday practices deployed before and after the implementation of a new system. Therefore the paper starts with identifying the inter- organisational routines deployed by learning networks and discusses the implementation of a technological platform in three learning networks in Austria, France and Ireland. The emerging technologies-in-practice are identified and the way that these technologies-in-practice fail or succeed to enhance the relevant routines is analysed. A survey among the learning networks members gives further insights into the actual aspects of the network routines that were affected by the introduced technology and its situated usages.  \r\n\r\nThe paper argues that, in the context of a network, only the alignment of transparent with receptive technologies-in-practice instigated by different stakeholders can produce a real impact on the inter-organisational routines and structures. In fact the alignment of technologies-in-practice within the network can influence critically several repertoires of inter-organisational routines such as the communication and informal knowledge sharing routines, with critical implications for the improvement of the whole network.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tsekouras, George","Kanellou, Despina"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Andreau and C Ciborra.

This paper examines the institutions of the Debian community where issues of community identity, distribution of authority, and decentralisation have facilitated growth and development. These same institutions have also resulted in conflicts regarding community purposes and the quality and delivery of the community’s output. We examine the institutional redesign undertaken to address these problems and derive implications for F/LOS communities and companies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mateos-Garcia, Juan","Steinmueller, W.

Among liquid phase models, the analysis is focused on the model based on the assumption that the liquid thermal conductivity is infinitely large, and the so called effective thermal conductivity model. Seven gas phase models are compared. These are six semi-theoretical models, based on various assumptions, and a model based solely on the approximation to experimental data. It is pointed out that the gas phase model, taking into account the finite thickness of the thermal boundary layer around the droplet, predicts the evaporation time closest to the one based on the approximation to experimental data. \r\nThe values of the absorption coefficients of gasoline fuel (BP Pump Grade 95 RON ULG), 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (CH3)2CHCH2C(CH3)3 (iso-octane) and 3-pentanone CH3CH2COCH2(CH3)3 have been measured experimentally in the range of wavelengths between 0.2 μm and 4 μm. The values of the average absorption efficiency factor for all fuels have been approximated by a power function aRdb, where Rd is the droplet radius. a and b in turn have been approximated by piecewise quadratic functions of the radiation temperature, with the coefficients calculated separately in the ranges 2 - 5 μm, 5 - 50 μm, 50 - 100 μm and 100 - 200 μm for all fuels. This new approximation is shown to be more accurate compared with the case when a and b are approximated by quadratic functions or fourth power polynomials of the radiation temperature, with the coefficients calculated in the full range of 2 - 200 μm. \r\nResults of experimental studies of heating and evaporation of monodisperse ethanol and acetone droplets in two regimes are compared with the results of modelling. It is pointed out that for relatively small droplets the experimentally measured droplet temperatures are close to the predicted average droplet temperatures, while for larger droplets the experimentally measured droplet temperatures are close to the temperatures predicted at the centre of droplets.\r\n All the developed models have been implemented into the KIVA-2 CFD code and validated against available in-house experimental data referring to spray penetration and ignition delay in Diesel engines.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kristyadi, Tarsisius"],"dc:date":"2007-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The first has moved from organisation around functional disciplines to product-based, cross-functional teams, while the second has done the reverse. The paper reviews the effects of these different organisational solutions on the processes of knowledge integration within the firms, the effects on communities of practice and the ways in which the systems have developed and adapted in response to the reorganisations.

The aim is to identify the causes and consequences of divergencies between A- and B-type processes in a complex product, and to draw implications for theory and practice. The paper also develops a simple partial model to show what A-type processes actually \"look like\" in practice. The evidence indicates that in response to industrial turbulence, uncertainty, technical complexity and difficulties in capturing user requirements, software engineers and project managers fall back heavily on A-type informal systems and \"soft\" management becomes essential to project success. Success under such circumstances, B-type rational systems are inadequate to the task at hand and soft factors such as goodwill, negotiation skills, rule breaking and informal communications become essential to project success. These findings contrast with most approaches to software engineering which try to impose highly rational processes and tend to ignore soft issues. The paper also indicates potential benefits of the rational approach, sometimes overlooked by contemporary organisational scholars, by arguing that it is the manner in which B-type processes are developed and implemented which leads to divergencies and difficulties, rather than the processes themselves which are an essential part of orderly progress. While the findings may not be relevant to more simple products and tasks, other complex product systems may well face similar divergencies and project management challenges.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brady, Tim","Hobday, Michael"],"dc:date":"1998","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.215035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931240,"sim:weight":0.211948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1339,"sim:weight":0.200946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931672,"sim:weight":0.188467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.183783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.177474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9851,"sim:weight":0.176689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.174153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.16271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.161744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3206,"sim:weight":0.160393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931822,"sim:weight":0.153339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.152418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.146992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933572,"sim:weight":0.143293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.143293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.140486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931029,"sim:weight":0.139591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.139171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.137393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At the semantic level, two regions correspond when they represent the same set. However, we wish to construct a purely syntactic definition of corresponding regions, so that reasoning can take place entirely at the diagrammatic level. This task is interesting in Euler diagrams because some regions of one diagram may be missing from another. We construct the correspondence relation from `zones\u0027 or minimal regions, introducing the concept of `zonal regions\u0027 for the case in which labels may differ between diagrams.

An attempt to remove the need for such a reading tree (or perhaps to automatically generate a reading tree, which could be altered by a user if they wished to) has been given via an algorithm to generate a default reading from the diagram. This algorithm is based on a number of principles – most of which are properties of the diagram.

However, this involves extracting extra information about the reading order from the diagram creator. Progress has been made towards a default reading, which extracts this information implicitly from the diagram. In this paper, we investigate how humans read ambiguous constraint diagrams intuitively, without any instructions on the reading order. We test several principles which could be used in a default reading. We conclude that although some of these principles have significant effects, they also may conflict.

The expressive power of these languages varies, but the majority are monadic and some include equality. Spider diagrams are one such language, being equivalent in expressive power to monadic first order logic with equality. Spiders are used to represent the existence of elements or specific individuals and distinct spiders represent distinct elements. Logical connectives are used to join diagrams, increasing the expressiveness of the language. Spider diagrams that do not incorporate logical connectives are called unitary diagrams.

In this paper, we focus on visual languages based on closed curves, which are used in numerous computing applications.

Semantic parsing is realized through a bottom-up type parsing paradigm where the operators are based on semantic concepts, obtained from a lexicon. A statistically trained model specializes the parser, by guiding the runtime beam-like search of possible parses. The semantic representation is a logical form equivalent to a Discourse Representation Structure (DRS). Each output of the parser is given a probability according to how similar, given a contextual word similarity measure, the parsing process for the input was to those collected during the training phase. Contextual information during parsing allows for better coverage of large domains. The non syntactic but very semantic nature of the parser would make it very tolerant to noisy (recognized) speech input. Shallow parsing using First-Order Logic (FOL) allows for fast but meaningful enough processing of the input, which makes the parser well suited for real-time Spoken Dialogs Systems (SDS).","bibo:AuthorList":["Genereux, M."],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44655,"sim:weight":0.31416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.183879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18877,"sim:weight":0.170782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12338,"sim:weight":0.168733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.155963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.143185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930973,"sim:weight":0.141628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382076,"sim:weight":0.138759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.127237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.12512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43158,"sim:weight":0.124116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57954,"sim:weight":0.123851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931336,"sim:weight":0.103494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21797,"sim:weight":0.0601152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934425,"sim:weight":0.0515702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At present, existing CH collections are stored using all sorts of formats, sometimes proprietary, often defined roughly, which \r\nmakes it difficult to share or access heterogeneous information among the CH community. There is a need for a tool to map diverse formats into CIDOC-CRM, assisted by another tool using intelligent language technology to help the mapping whenever fields are underspecified or loosely described, both tools being complementary. In some cases, it may even be better to build fragments of a CIDOC database directly from informal descriptions in natural \r\nlanguage only, as the CH community may be reluctant to switch to new formats of data entry. Therefore, this paper focus primarily on the mapping of CH data described in natural language into CIDOC-CRM triples, the building blocks of the full CIDOC-CRM ontology. The methods exploits the propositional nature of CIDOC-CRM triples. Using WordNet as a lexical database and the WEB as corpus, we first extract triples from examples provided in the CIDOC-CRM literature, and then from text describing the medieval city of Wolfenbüttel.

Grammar Learning by Partition Search is a general method for automatically constructing \r\ngrammars for a range of parsing tasks; it constructs an optimised probabilistic context-free grammar by searching a space of nonterminal \r\nset partitions, looking for a partition that maximises parsing performance and minimises grammar size. The idea is that the considerable \r\ntime and cost involved in building new grammars can be avoided if instead existing grammars can be automatically adapted to new \r\nparsing tasks and new domains. This paper presents results for applying Partition Search to the tasks of (i) identifying flat N P chunks, \r\nand (ii) identifying all N Ps in a text. For N P chunking, Partition Search improves a general baseline result by 12.7%, and a method- \r\nspecific baseline by 2.2%. For N P identification, Partition Search improves the general baseline by 21.45%, and the method-specific \r\none by 3.48%.

This paper looks at treebank-training of generators, an alternative method for building statistical models for NL G from raw corpora, and two different ways of using treebank-trained models during generation. Results show that the treebank-trained generators achieve improvements similar to a 2-gram generator over a baseline of random selection. However, the treebank-trained generators achieve this at a much lower cost than the 2-gram generator, and without its strong preference for shorter reasations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Belz, A."],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18877,"sim:weight":0.23113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.218763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12338,"sim:weight":0.218763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99165,"sim:weight":0.217311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4393,"sim:weight":0.214719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931138,"sim:weight":0.206377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.206207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.195554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75649,"sim:weight":0.175394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.17479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46529,"sim:weight":0.167193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45917,"sim:weight":0.145992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98526,"sim:weight":0.142989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43158,"sim:weight":0.0838155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19896,"sim:weight":0.0784004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19857,"sim:weight":0.0714988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16075,"sim:weight":0.0700925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15803,"sim:weight":0.0685909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21797,"sim:weight":0.0685791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20593,"sim:weight":0.0683565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We find that our human subjects agree on choice of expression to a considerable degree, with three identical expressions selected in 50% of cases. We tested automatic selection strategies based on most frequent choice heuristics, involving different combinations of information about syntactic MSR type and domain type.

A long-tube, rate of injection rig was used to measure the injection rate of the fuel injection system. Quantification of cyclic variation and rate of injection were carried out for single and multiple-injection strategy. For multiple-injections, it was found that the injected mass of the first of the split was approximately 19% less than that of the single injection strategy for the same injection duration. The second split reduction was less than 4% in comparison to the single injection strategy. The transient response of the fuel injection equipment was characterised and compared with steady-state behaviour. The characteristics of the Proteus rig in terms of trapped air mass and transient incylinder temperature were investigated and quantified. The effect of in-cylinder temperature, density and pressure, as well as injection pressure on the characteristics of spray formation, for single and multi-hole nozzles were investigated using high speed video cameras. Cycle-to-cycle and hole-to-hole variations for multi-hole nozzles were investigated and attributed to uneven fuel pressure distribution round the needle seat, and subsequent cavitation phenomena. Simultaneous Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Mie scattering techniques were used to investigate spray formation and vapour propagation for multihole nozzles for single and multiple-injection strategy. The multiple injection work focused on the effect of dwell period between each injection. Two different modes of flow were identified. These are described as \u0027wake impingement\u0027 and \u0027cavity mode wake effect\u0027, resulting in increased tip velocity of the second split spray. The increase in tip velocity depended on dwell period and distance downstream of the nozzle exit. The maximum increase was calculated at 17 m/s. A spray pattern growth for the second of the split injections, the \u0027exceed type\u0027 was identified, resulting from an increase in tip penetration due to air entrainment of the first split and propagation into the cooler vapour phase from the first split. The effect of liquid core length near the nozzle exit was investigated using modified empirical correlations and the evolution of the discharge coefficient obtained from rate of injection measurements. The results showed increased injection pressure and increased in-cylinder gas pressure reduce both break-up length and break-up time. Penetration was modelled using conservation of mass and momentum of the injected fuel mass. The input to the numerical model was the measured transient rate of injection. The model traced the centre-of-mass of the spray and was validated against PLIF data for centre-of-mass. Overall, the same value of modelling parameters gave good agreement for single and split injection strategy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Karimi, K."],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5737,"sim:weight":0.6131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6249,"sim:weight":0.232332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8168,"sim:weight":0.228882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9080,"sim:weight":0.199431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76824,"sim:weight":0.194888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6476,"sim:weight":0.194593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51769,"sim:weight":0.188347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386560,"sim:weight":0.184542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":356535,"sim:weight":0.183286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52556,"sim:weight":0.181412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52085,"sim:weight":0.171677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385205,"sim:weight":0.169288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930216,"sim:weight":0.167536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":379971,"sim:weight":0.166729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103281,"sim:weight":0.162222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":197867,"sim:weight":0.153497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.151488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1926223,"sim:weight":0.13539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931336,"sim:weight":0.130564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8636,"sim:weight":0.124855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To characterise the spray, the nozzle flow was measured by the rate tube technique. The sensitivity of the flow to injection pressure was shown to follow the theoretical behaviour. Penetrations of the liquid spray were measured by means of high speed video imaging. The innovative measurements of the liquid penetration during the combustion allowed combustion phases and liquid jet lengths to be associated. Hydroxyl (OH) radicals were acquired by planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). Combined with high speed videos of the flame natural luminosity, they were used to identify precisely the evolution of combustion in time and space. The measured OH distributions compared favourably with results from simulations using the KIVA code. The OH radicals were shown to be present mainly in the mixing controlled phase, distributed in a thin layer around the vapour fuel in the jet, within the diffusion flame location. OH radicals could be seen as early as 0.4 ms before the pre-mixed heat-release spike and until the end of apparent heat release. In the conditions studied, the diffusion flame, therefore, spanned most of the combustion process, starting very soon after autoignition. Finally distributions of NO were acquired by LIF and compared with the evolution of combustion. NO was found to appear 0.5 to 1 ms after the development of the diffusion flame, on the lean side of the flame front, outside the region with a high density of OH radicals but also later on, downstream the spray, on the outskirts of the zone with high soot density. The formation rate of NO was found almost constant during the mixing controlled combustion, with a small increase at the end of injection, when the flame collapsed on the fuel spray. The observed increase was linked to a rapid cooling of the flame plume and the associated freezing of the thermal-NO mechanism. Varying injection pressures did not significantly affect the overall formation rate although peak NO densities were seen to gradually move downstream the flame plume with increased injection pressure. NO formation increased with the in-cylinder pressure in accordance with a higher density of air and higher local temperatures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Demory, R."],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5737,"sim:weight":0.602168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6249,"sim:weight":0.27276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8636,"sim:weight":0.271136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8168,"sim:weight":0.25757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6476,"sim:weight":0.240869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9080,"sim:weight":0.232634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930216,"sim:weight":0.196497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76824,"sim:weight":0.178527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52556,"sim:weight":0.176947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103281,"sim:weight":0.16666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.155457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94824,"sim:weight":0.149481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":197867,"sim:weight":0.148059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1926223,"sim:weight":0.145644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386560,"sim:weight":0.144666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":379971,"sim:weight":0.135162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385205,"sim:weight":0.130174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931336,"sim:weight":0.127434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1388256,"sim:weight":0.123102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1928322,"sim:weight":0.121242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The spray images were analysed to provide spray characteristics which include the spray tip penetration length, initial spray hesitation, nozzle opening time delay, hole-to-hole spray variation and spray structure. Both single and multi-hole nozzles were used to study these parameters. Fuel droplet characteristics within dense Diesel sprays were studied using Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) in an optical rapid compression machine. A comprehensive study of the PDA operating parameters was conducted. Additionally, the effects of injection pressure and in-cylinder pressure and temperature upon spray properties were studied. PDA has proved to be a valuable technique in providing an understanding of the structure and characteristics of sprays. However, the application of PDA to dense sprays is difficult. The results obtained are not always reliable and the accuracy of the results is often questionable. Phase Doppler Anemometers are not immune to errors and by carefully identifying these errors, the accuracy of the technique can be significantly improved. The effects of the PDA system parameters on the measurement accuracy have been studied. It was found that a thorough study of the operating parameters was required to tailor the system to the measurements of dense sprays. The photomultipliers voltages, the laser beam power and the size of the measurement volume all show significant effects on measured droplet diameters. Spray produced from a common-rail injection system proved to be a challenging environment for the PDA. Following the calibration of the PDA, investigations were conducted to study the effects of various parameters on spray characteristics including injection pressure, in-cylinder pressure and temperature. Results are presented for incylinder pressures ranging from 1.6 to 6 MPa and injection pressures from 60 to 160 MPa. The highest injection pressure produced faster droplets and improved the spray atomisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lacoste, J."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8604,"sim:weight":0.525585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338206,"sim:weight":0.28334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337603,"sim:weight":0.271972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337917,"sim:weight":0.254751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337654,"sim:weight":0.250619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337974,"sim:weight":0.247044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337869,"sim:weight":0.246757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337309,"sim:weight":0.246699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337749,"sim:weight":0.246575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338309,"sim:weight":0.244639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338154,"sim:weight":0.241789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338164,"sim:weight":0.241574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338384,"sim:weight":0.240515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337702,"sim:weight":0.239258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337860,"sim:weight":0.23626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337892,"sim:weight":0.236083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337675,"sim:weight":0.235403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337735,"sim:weight":0.235209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337678,"sim:weight":0.235079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337778,"sim:weight":0.234042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although several correlations for diesel spray penetration at different operating conditions have been presented in the literature, to date the findings are in-conclusive with only limited investigation into the operating envelope expected in present and future high speed direct injection diesel engines.\r\nThe present paper describes how two high-speed video cameras were utilised to achieved pseudo 3-dimensional imaging of the spray (backlit) and of auto-ignition sites (flame lumines-cence). It also describes how Schlieren imaging enabled vapour phase analysis. Data have been gathered for in-cylinder densities in the range 10 to 50 kg.m-3 and injection pressures be-tween 60 and 160 MPa. New correlations have been established for the penetration of both the liquid and vapour phases of a high-pressure diesel spray injected from a modern VCO nozzle common rail system. By increasing injection pressures and using small injector orifice sizes, it is thought that the injected diesel droplets reduce in size and penetrate further, hence increas-ing air utilisation, thus leading to faster evaporation rates and reduced ignition delay. An ex-perimental correlation for auto-ignition delay against in-cylinder density has been presented, suggesting that as the charge density increases, penetration is reduced but auto-ignition delay is reduced, indicating more favourable conditions for ignition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Laguitton, O.","Gold, M.R.","Kennaird, D.A.","Crua, C.","Lacoste, J.","Heikal, M.R."],"dc:date":"2002-11-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52556,"sim:weight":0.329972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930216,"sim:weight":0.301122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86083,"sim:weight":0.300164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386560,"sim:weight":0.292715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764307,"sim:weight":0.266684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57701,"sim:weight":0.260306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76824,"sim:weight":0.254343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":379971,"sim:weight":0.250239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.249197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45439,"sim:weight":0.249068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9541086,"sim:weight":0.247345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385236,"sim:weight":0.241037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75485,"sim:weight":0.235978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52201,"sim:weight":0.227044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53673,"sim:weight":0.214657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5084149,"sim:weight":0.212213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5447770,"sim:weight":0.20946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52008,"sim:weight":0.207696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384739,"sim:weight":0.205886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5447763,"sim:weight":0.199848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Proteus experiments aimed to simulate realistic Diesel engine working conditions whilst allowing visualisation of in-cylinder processes by various optical and laser diagnostics techniques. The spray penetration was explored by laser diagnostics methods such as Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and the Mie scattering techniques. High-speed video (HSV) images of the spray were also recorded to show the temporal evolution of the spray. Both liquid and vapour phases of the spray were captured by the LIF technique whilst Mie scattering only recorded the liquid part of the spray. In the current study, a 7-hole injector of the solenoid type was injecting 20mm3 of Diesel fuel each cycle at an injection pressure of 100MPa and in-cylinder pressures 2MPa and 6MPa. The fuel was injected in a split mode with various dwells between the 10mm3 + 10mm3 splits (or individual fuel injections). The instantaneous injection rate was measured by the long-tube rate technique. These data were taken as an input to the numerical model tracking the centre-of-mass (CoM) of the injected fuel. The modelling is based on the conservation of momentum of injected fuel mass in the presence of a realistic drag force acting on the whole spray as a physical body. This approach is particularly suitable for the dense sprays near the nozzle as an asymptotic case for the strong interaction between the spray droplets. Hence the CoM approach is seen as complementary to the traditional Lagrangian modelling for dispersed sprays widely employed by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. Air entrainment was modelled by the exponential decay of liquid fraction in the spray with a characteristic time t. Under the conventional assumption of the conical shape of the spray, the penetration of spray tip was associated with the height of the cone. This allowed the calculation of the frontal area A required in the expression for the drag force. The numerical CoM model was validated against the experimental CoM data in the range of in-cylinder pressures and dwells between two consecutive injections (or splits). The following four cases were calculated and validated against the experimental data: in-cylinder pressures (ICP) 2MPa and 6MPa, split injection strategy with dwells 0.425ms and 0.625ms between injections. In all cases, the injection pressure was 100MPa; under cold intake conditions of ambient air. For validation purposes the image processing software was extended to characterise the position of the centre-of-mass of injected fuel. The ratio of tip penetration to the position of the centre-of-mass, b was assessed from LIF images for ICP \u003d 2MPa and dwells 0.425ms and 0.625ms. An average value of the ratio with a corresponding standard deviation b \u003d1.85 ± 0.3was accepted for the validation of the model calculations versus experiment for all cases under consideration. An uncertainty corridor was constructed for the model validation against the HSV experiment. The corridor was formed by the curves corresponding to b \u003d 2.15 and b \u003d1.55 with the curve for b \u003d1.85 in the middle. A good agreement was observed between the calculated and experimental CoM penetration.

These explored issues of good practice as well as barriers to the successful uptake of research by practitioners and communication between academics and practitioners.  Findings indicate that there are – still – key perceptual and practical issues which work against practitioner access to and uptake of research that comes from the academic community.

{"identifier":8517,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Properties of Euler diagrams","bibo:abstract":"Euler diagrams have numerous application areas, with a large variety of languages based on them. In relation to software engineering, such areas encompass modelling and specification including from a formal perspective. In all of these application areas, it is desirable to provide tools to layout Euler diagrams, ideally in a nice way. Various notions of `niceness\u0027 can be correlated with certain properties that an Euler diagram may or may not possess. Indeed, the relevant layout algorithms developed to date produce Euler diagrams that have certain sets of properties, sometimes called well-formedness conditions. However, there is not a commonly agreed definition of an Euler diagram and the properties imposed on them are rarely stated precisely. In this paper, we provide a very general definition of an Euler diagram, which can be constrained in varying ways in order to match the variety of definitions that exist in the literature. Indeed, the constraints imposed correspond to properties that the diagrams may possess. A contribution of this paper is to provide formal definitions of these properties and we discuss when these properties may be desirable. Our definition of an Euler diagram and the formalization of these properties provides a general language for the Euler diagram community to utilize. A consequence of using a common language will be better integration of, and more accessible, research results.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stapleton, G.","Rodgers, P.","Howse, J.","Taylor, J."],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.170754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103021,"sim:weight":0.169022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.149459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.148338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2632,"sim:weight":0.147622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.142228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44505,"sim:weight":0.137418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47252,"sim:weight":0.12941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932650,"sim:weight":0.054343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We have worked on spider diagrams, which visually express logical statements. Ideally, automatically generated proofs should be short and easy to understand. An existing proof generator for spider diagrams successfully writes proofs, but they can be long and unwieldy. In this paper, we present a new approach to proof writing in diagrammatic systems, which is guaranteed to find shortest proofs and can be extended to incorporate other readability criteria. We apply the A* algorithm and develop an admissible heuristic function to guide automatic proof construction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the heuristic used. The work has been implemented as part of a spider diagram reasoning tool.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flower, J.","Masthoff, J.","Stapleton, G.","Blackwell, A.","Marriott, K.","Shimojima, A."],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8418,"sim:weight":0.340196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8511,"sim:weight":0.318401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8507,"sim:weight":0.299546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8406,"sim:weight":0.28433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8410,"sim:weight":0.263022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8378,"sim:weight":0.240287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8524,"sim:weight":0.239776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8408,"sim:weight":0.165029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.148875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.148833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931336,"sim:weight":0.146408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.144942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.140563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631627,"sim:weight":0.128302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.126563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75649,"sim:weight":0.11998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18009,"sim:weight":0.116474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385208,"sim:weight":0.114497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103281,"sim:weight":0.114063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76980,"sim:weight":0.111043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The objective was to establish how engine out NOx emissions can be reduced to the estimated levels required by the next emissions target ‘Euro 6’ and thus be able to apply the findings to the original 4-cylinder engine and minimise the requirement for currently immature NOx after treatment. It has been proposed that further reduction in compression ratio beyond current levels would be beneficial to engine out emissions and specific power, and could be facilitated by developments in cold start technology. The results of a study using this single cylinder facility to evaluate the effect of reducing compression ratio from 18.4 to 16.0 are presented. It was found that, although there was a small CO and HC penalty, either reducing the compression ratio or retarding the injection timing greatly reduced NOx and soot emissions when both premixed and diffusion-combustion phases were present. This effect was less significant when the combustion was solely premixed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Laguitton, O.","Crua, C.","Cowell, T.","Heikal, M.R.","Gold, M.R."],"dc:date":"2007-09-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This paper explores the pattern and pace of a sample of exporting TNC subsidiaries operating in the electronics industry in Thailand, showing how the different architectures of global value chains (centralised versus decentralised) shaped the technological progress of subsidiaries in this country. The case evidence suggests a wide variety in upgrading through time, with some subsidiaries failing to develop capabilities and remaining as ‘assembly only’ plants. Other more dynamic plants developed process engineering and product design skills, investing heavily in capability building. One common determinant in capability building appears to be the overall technology strategy of the global value chain leader (or parent company). In those subsidiaries which did not upgrade beyond assembly, technology decisions and processes were tightly controlled within the parent headquarter locations in relatively centralised international value networks. By contrast, the more dynamic plants exercised more discretion over local capability building.

This study was conducted to consider the use of calcaneal scanning with quantitative ultrasound—contact ultrasound bone analysis (CUBA)—to diagnose osteoporosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. \r\n\r\nMethods: Forty-six patients (11 men and 35 women) with established rheumatoid arthritis underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of the nondominant wrist and CUBA of the nondominant heel. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were used to determine the correlation between osteoporosis as diagnosed by the CUBA heel scan compared with the DEXA wrist scan given that DEXA is widely seen as the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. \r\n\r\nResults: The CUBA heel scan revealed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 44% for a diagnosis of osteoporosis compared with DEXA. The positive predictive value of the CUBA scan was 31%, and the negative predictive value was 94%. Therefore, if normal bone density is found using CUBA, there is 94% certainty this is correct. However, if osteoporosis is diagnosed using CUBA, there is only 31% certainty this is correct. In such instances a secondary scan using a different method (eg, DEXA) would be required. Future work should consider the effect of minor alterations to the equipment or scanning protocol, because this may improve diagnosis. \r\n\r\nConclusions: The CUBA unit could be used as a primary screening device. Given the cost and accessibility issues associated with DEXA, quantitative ultrasound may have a role in screening for osteoporosis in the primary-care setting to determine the most appropriate routes of referral for patients requiring further investigations.

Two engine operating parameters were used as inputs to the model, namely in-cylinder pressure and air density. Spray penetration length was modelled on the basis of these two inputs. The models derived using the two techniques were validated using test data that had not been used during training.

A description of the development of a single cylinder test facility is presented, being based on a production 4-cylinder DI diesel engine and designed to allow study of the emissions characteristics over a very wide range of operating conditions. The objective was to establish how engine out NOx emissions can be reduced to the estimated levels required by the next emissions target ‘Euro 6’ and thus be able to apply the findings to the original 4-cylinder engine and minimise the requirement for currently immature NOx after treatment.\r\nTo meet these needs, both the intake and exhaust systems were developed so that inlet air conditions and exhaust back-pressure could be individually varied over wide ranges independently of the other engine operating conditions. Several key operating points were defined across a load speed map to represent a typical drive cycle requirement. Baseline emissions data at these key points had been taken for the 4-cylinder engine and were reproduced on the single cylinder engine.\r\nIt has been proposed that further reduction in compression ratio beyond current levels would be beneficial to engine out emissions and specific power, and could be facilitated by developments in cold start technology. The results of a study using this single cylinder facility to evaluate the effect of reducing compression ratio from 18.4 to 16.0 are presented. This was achieved by modifying the piston bowl while maintaining the production engine squish clearance. Injection timing investigations were performed at a number of the key operating points and the corresponding pressure-time curves analysed to help explain the measured results. It was found that, although there was a small CO and HC penalty, either reducing the compression ratio or retarding the injection timing greatly reduced NOx and soot emissions when both premixed and diffusion-combustion phases were present. This effect was less significant when the combustion was solely premixed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Laguitton, O.","Crua, C.","Cowell, T.","Heikal, M.R.","Gold, M.R."],"dc:date":"2006-07-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"O Laguitton, C Crua, T Cowell, M R Heikal and M R Gold.

Two multi-hole injectors, of the solenoid type, were used; one with a faster response actuator. A high speed video image acquisition system was used to characterise the liquid spray formation, penetration, cone angle, and general spray structure. The experimental spray penetration data have revealed the onset of spray tip instability (cluster shedding) at the later stages of spray penetration. \r\nThe instantaneous rate and shape of injection for different operating conditions has been measured using an injection rate-tube technique. The combination of the above techniques has allowed an alternative approach in the use of empirical spray penetration correlation to be modified in order to gain information on breakup length. This was achieved by way of the derivation of a breakup length proportionality constant, where historically, this constant was found experimentally. \r\nAn approach to the modelling of transient spray penetration based on the momentum conservation of the in-jected fuel mass as a physical body of varying mass under that action of the drag force acting on the whole body.

The paper reviews the market- and resource-based views of the firm and argues that the activities of buyers directly and indirectly contribute to the innovation process of a firm as ‘signallers’, ‘revealers’ and ‘collaborators’. Examples are drawn from the video games industry which has particular constraints coupled with buyer and innovation demands arising out of fast-changing technologies, markets and resources that have ever-shortening shelf lives; namely, characters, title franchises and gaming/technology platforms. We suggest that, for the video game industry, buyers particularly value firms’ dynamic capabilities, specifically those capabilities that contribute to product creation and product development capabilities of ‘super developers’ over other considerations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Readman, Jeff","Grantham, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2006-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A two-stroke diesel Proteus engine has been modified to allow optical access for visualisation of in-cylinder combustion processes. Various optical techniques were used to investigate the combustion processes. These include high-speed video recording of the liquid phase, high-speed schlieren video recording of the vapour phase and laser-induced incandescence for soot imaging. The spray cone angle and penetration with time data extracted from photographic and high-speed video studies are presented.\r\n\r\nThe effects of droplet evaporation, breakup and air entrainment at the initial stage of spray penetration were studied theoretically using three models. It was found that the predictions of the model combining bag breakup and air entrainment are in good agreement with the experimental measurements.\r\n\r\nSpray autoignition was investigated using video, in-cylinder pressure, and schlieren recordings. Pseudo three-dimensional visualisation of the autoignition was achieved by simultaneous use of two high-speed video cameras at right angles to each other. The effects of elevated injection and in-cylinder pressures on the ignition delay and ignition sites have been investigated.\r\n\r\nLaser-induced incandescence was performed to obtain maps of soot concentration for a range of engine conditions. The influence of in-cylinder and injection pressures on soot formation sites and relative soot concentration has been studied. The work has been mainly focused on the specificities of soot formation under extreme in-cylinder conditions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Crua, Cyril"],"dc:date":"2002-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8484,"sim:weight":0.525585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338206,"sim:weight":0.292367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337861,"sim:weight":0.248543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337603,"sim:weight":0.235963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":873455,"sim:weight":0.224956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337917,"sim:weight":0.221256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337654,"sim:weight":0.217252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337974,"sim:weight":0.215054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337749,"sim:weight":0.214547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337869,"sim:weight":0.214209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337309,"sim:weight":0.213676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133658,"sim:weight":0.213436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338309,"sim:weight":0.212493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338154,"sim:weight":0.209891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338164,"sim:weight":0.209712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338384,"sim:weight":0.208792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337702,"sim:weight":0.207437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337892,"sim:weight":0.204948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337860,"sim:weight":0.204795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337621,"sim:weight":0.204358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, distributing functionality across different devices may create new problems for interaction and interface designers more used to creating consistency and coherence within a single technology.  As an example, we describe the design and development of a system that facilitates language learning from a combination of two devices, interactive television (iTV) and mobile phone, drawing on the strengths of each technology.

There were no significant differences between groups in the magnitude of peak plantar pressure in the forefoot region. Significant differences were, however, noted for temporal aspects of foot-pressure measurement. The duration of loading over sensors detecting peak plantar pressure was significantly longer in the rheumatoid arthritis group. In addition, the rheumatoid arthritis group demonstrated significantly greater force–time integrals. Significant increases in the temporal parameters of plantar pressure distribution, rather than those of amplitude, may be characteristic of the rheumatoid foot.

Successful well-managed companies thrive in mature markets by focusing on doing what they do, just a little bit better. Consequently, when a disruptive event, such as new technology or a regulatory  change comes along, the successful company is often blindsided. It is just not very good at the ‘doing it different’ type of innovation. The very attributes that make it successful in stable conditions hinder its ability to detect or exploit the change.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of failing to take advantage of such disruptive change are all too frequently severe. Companies lose out to new entrants. Eastman Kodak, for example, struggled to cope with a shift to digital photography. Xerox failed to capitalise on digital photocopying.

{"identifier":8632,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The Role of Action Learning in Supporting Continuous Innovation in Small to Medium Sized Firms (SMEs)","bibo:abstract":"It has long been recognised that innovation is a key motor of economic change, as it stimulates intense forms of competition. In order to innovate, our research suggests that businesses need to be proactive, able to audit the environment to identify change and opportunity.\r\n\r\nThey must be open to challenge, and prepared to experiment; but most of all learning is the key. Small businesses face particular obstacles whilst innovating on account of their size; these include a lack of time, funds, staff and expertise. Consequently, small businesses have a high propensity to failure. The records show that some 66% of businesses cease trading during the 3 to 10 year period. Successfully managing a business is a challenge that calls on a wide range of skills and knowledge (Levy et al 2004).\r\n\r\nFor most business managers, it is the pooling of experience that generates the most useful knowledge and builds competence. Experience has demonstrated the value of bringing small numbers of businesses together in facilitated groups where, in a non-competitive environment, they gain the synergetic benefits arising from the sharing of their combined knowledge and experience. This paper presents early results from a research project aimed at assessing the impact of action learning on the innovative capability of small and medium sized firms.\r\n\r\nTeams of senior managers from non-competing sectors embarked on a one-year process of group-based learning, underpinned by the methods and approach of action learning. Each participant identified an innovation goal of critical\r\nimportance to their organisation. In terms of continuous innovation this can involve goals directed at product, service and business process improvement. Operational improvements using inter-organisational action learning have been described and documented by Coghlan et al (2002). In this project, specific improvements in innovation management capability have been examined. Action learning ‘sets’ and targeted learning were employed to support the\r\nlearning required to allow action towards the achievement of these goals (Levy and Knowles, 2003). The paper tests the proposition that Action Learning, supported by targeted learning, is an effective, time and cost efficient method for supporting technological product and process innovation.\r\n\r\nThe paper argues that action learning develops innovation managers into \"reflective practitioners\". Reflective practice is a fundamental competence needed to enable effective innovation management (Pedler 1996) (Weinstein 1998). The paper reports that action learning set members found the process to be beneficial for supporting continuous innovation in their firms. The regular ‘touchpoint’ of the action learning process helped to create a continuity in thinking about innovation in their business. Indeed, the totality of meetings, when analysed identifies a process of continuous innovation of business thinking, business strategy and process.\r\n\r\nThe paper will present the results of post-programme interviews with participants and highlight learning and best practice in the use of Action Learning as a method for supporting Continuous Innovation in SMEs. Areas for further\r\nresearch will also be discussed and emerging research questions highlighted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Levy, Paul","Knowles, David","Junkar, Mihael"],"dc:date":"2005-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.415471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.409201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99444,"sim:weight":0.404307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.390024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.381405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102627,"sim:weight":0.352201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.336604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.3279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.304145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387062,"sim:weight":0.243198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.239873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9851,"sim:weight":0.226922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76980,"sim:weight":0.222221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48424,"sim:weight":0.22183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103021,"sim:weight":0.215866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45967,"sim:weight":0.205769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31868,"sim:weight":0.197839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.197523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.193897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102957,"sim:weight":0.185426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Adding complexity to the species area relationship, a new predictive model?","bibo:abstract":"Ghylls are linear valley features cut into the sandstone beds of the Weald of south-eastern England. The indigenous ghyll woodlands are highly species rich, supporting distinctive assemblages of cryptogamic plants. We assessed the ability of the species-area relationship, the Choros model and a modified version of the Choros model to describe variations in higher plant diversity. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to produce proxy environmental variables, multi-regression analysis of which allowed factors determining diversity to be investigated. Field layer diversity varied substantially between ghylls. The data did not fit the species area relationship. A statistically weak fit was provided by the standard Choros model. The modified Choros model, incorporating a PCA generated proxy variable for habitat diversity, provided a good fit. The results suggest that ghyll field layer diversity is primarily determined by habitat diversity and to a lesser extent by ghyll isolation, length and area.","bibo:AuthorList":["Waite, S.","Burnside, N.G.","Flint, A.R.","Eycott, A.","Scott, D.","Smithers, R.J."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8168,"sim:weight":0.571346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17005,"sim:weight":0.530892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8561,"sim:weight":0.528736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14440,"sim:weight":0.410529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8065,"sim:weight":0.390517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52556,"sim:weight":0.354212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930216,"sim:weight":0.352799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45439,"sim:weight":0.294671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9378,"sim:weight":0.293781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76824,"sim:weight":0.289036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8063,"sim:weight":0.28028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5737,"sim:weight":0.275984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220189,"sim:weight":0.273799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8482,"sim:weight":0.271136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384739,"sim:weight":0.264975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386560,"sim:weight":0.26004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9080,"sim:weight":0.25677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":379971,"sim:weight":0.252036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930626,"sim:weight":0.249506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52008,"sim:weight":0.233313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Simple classifications of types of image and of types of user are proposed. Consideration is then given in outline to how semantic content is realised by each class of user within each class of image. The argument is advanced that this realisation finds expression in perceptual, generic interpretive and specific interpretive content. This analytic framework provides the basis for the specification of a broadly encompassing evaluation study, which will employ the image/user type classification and the expert domain knowledge of selected user groups in the construction of segmented test collections of real queries, images and relevance judgements. From this study should come a better-informed view on the nature of semantic information need, and on the representation and recovery of semantic content across a broad spectrum of image retrieval activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Enser, Peter G.B.","Sandom, Christine J."],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1586072,"sim:weight":0.355268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15476,"sim:weight":0.335955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5447770,"sim:weight":0.331558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931336,"sim:weight":0.329512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52122,"sim:weight":0.326868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5084149,"sim:weight":0.325631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930842,"sim:weight":0.32505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52164,"sim:weight":0.324191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160271,"sim:weight":0.321435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5447763,"sim:weight":0.314929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385205,"sim:weight":0.31075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65922,"sim:weight":0.29628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.289232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50328,"sim:weight":0.286734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.284874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931323,"sim:weight":0.279231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76824,"sim:weight":0.278373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5447789,"sim:weight":0.274805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":379971,"sim:weight":0.27448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930216,"sim:weight":0.271462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recent progress has been made in obtaining data-rich results using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models within smaller river reaches, but the application of CFD to large rivers has not been fully developed due to our inability to: i) design numerically-stable meshes for complex topographies, and ii) collect high resolution data appropriate for model boundary conditions.\r\nHere, we test a new five-term mass-flux scaling algorithm to include bed topography over large spatial scales, where the discretised form of the mass and momentum equations are modified using a mass-flux scalling approach. Converged solutions were obtained using Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations with a κ–ε RNG turbulence closure. Topographic and velocity data were collected for a 38 km reach in the Río Paraná, Argentina, to provide boundary conditions and validation data. The model results demonstrate the importance of topographic steering on determining flow structures in large rivers and the difficulties in objectively identifying coherent secondary flows.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sandbach, S.D.","Hardy, R.J.","Lane, S.N.","Parsons, D.R.","Best, J.L.","Ashworth, P.J.","Reesink, A.J.H.","Amsler, M.L.","Szupiany, R.N.","Nicholas, A.P.","Orfeo, O.","Sambrook-Smith, G.H.","Dittrich, A.","Koll, Ka","Aberle, J.","Geisenhainer, P."],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We relate EulerView displays to sets of paths in the transitive closure of the directed dual graph of an Euler diagram, and provide methods for transforming hierarchies with symbolic links into an EulerView display. Linking the display directly to the file system enabled the export of both the directory structure and resource placement which enables users to build small manageable views of their categorisation structure within which to place resources and then export this onto the larger file system. Using the transformation methods developed, we consider the importation of ACM classification into EulerView, enabling users to categorise and\r\nstore resources such as articles within the imported ACM classification. EulerView is tailored to be appropriate for the ACM CCS application, and new techniques for focus and navigation within EulerView are developed.","bibo:AuthorList":["De Chiara, R","Fish, A."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Flickr: Organize your photos.","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"Flickr: Organize your photos."},{"rawReferenceText":"Benjamin B Bederson, Ben Shneiderman and Martin Wattenberg.

Previous studies have argued for a prototype approach to modality, but have not constructed such an account consistently. Section 2 sets out the need for a prototype analysis, and section 3 offers a set of criteria which define the core of the category of modality. We examine several English modal auxiliaries with respect to the criteria, concluding that some of them frequently fail to meet the criteria and are therefore not core members of the category – in other words, they have a low degree of modality. Section 4 locates modality within a wider framework. In section 5 we revisit two problems in the analysis of English modals, arguing that the proposed framework sheds new light on them. Section 6 criticises the alternative analysis put forward by the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (Huddleston and Pullum 2002). We conclude that the framework needs to be tested on other languages, but that it appears to be useful for English.","bibo:AuthorList":["Salkie, Raphael","Salkie, Raphael","Busuttil, Pierre","van der Auwera, Johan"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English.","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English.","refDocId":372038},{"rawReferenceText":"A minimalist treatment of modality.","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"A minimalist treatment of modality."},{"rawReferenceText":"Thoughts.

Bands have been identified as being built on several intrinsic states, including a proposed 9/2-[514]   [direct-product]1/2+[400] two-quasineutron configuration that forms the Kpi\u003d5- intrinsic state at 2228 keV, and on a previously assigned Kpi\u003d8- intrinsic state at 2786 keV. A half-life of 73(3) ns has been measured for the latter. Theoretical calculations have been performed by using the configuration-constrained blocking method based on a nonaxial Woods-Saxon potential. Large gamma deformation and gamma softness are predicted for the ground state and the Kpi\u003d5- intrinsic state, whereas a nearly axially symmetric shape is predicted for the Kpi\u003d8- two-quasiparticle configuration. The low value of the hindrance factor for the E1 transition depopulating the Kpi\u003d8- intrinsic state is discussed in the context of analogous transitions in neighbouring N\u003d74 isotones.","bibo:AuthorList":["Orce, J.N.","Bruce, A.M.","Emmanouilidis, A.","Byrne, A.P.","Dracoulis, G.D.","Kibédi, T.","Caamaño, M.","El-Masri, H.","Pearson, C.J.","Podolyák, Zs.","Stevenson, P.D.","Walker, P.M.","Xu, F.R.","Cullen, D.M.","Wheldon, C."],"dc:date":"2006-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100815,"sim:weight":0.631519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100740,"sim:weight":0.62857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100947,"sim:weight":0.62857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397192,"sim:weight":0.624984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100747,"sim:weight":0.600885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103048,"sim:weight":0.599335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100773,"sim:weight":0.594397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100927,"sim:weight":0.588578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102700,"sim:weight":0.587491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397095,"sim:weight":0.570041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100918,"sim:weight":0.564834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100997,"sim:weight":0.564834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100850,"sim:weight":0.554407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":396958,"sim:weight":0.526522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000446,"sim:weight":0.508648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100808,"sim:weight":0.503198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100681,"sim:weight":0.495541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397470,"sim:weight":0.46778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397469,"sim:weight":0.448878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100849,"sim:weight":0.436952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The fluorescence signal was also corrected for broadband interferences and laser pulse energy variations.\r\nThe formation of NO started with the onset of the diffusion flame, no fluorescence being recorded during the pre-mixed phase. The peak signal was recorded after the end of heat release, 1.5 to 2 ms after the peak mixing-controlled heat release rate. Whereas conditions on the lean side of the diffusion flame are ideal for the formation of NO, only a small portion of the NO fluorescence originated from this region. The model showed that the fluorescence signal level is hindered during the combustion by high levels of collisional quenching and, on a smaller scale, broader population distributions.\r\nTo estimate the location and extent of the diffusion flame, the NO results were correlated with planar LIF measurements of OH. The measured OH distributions compared favourably with results from simulations using the KIVA 3V release 2 code. The OH radicals are shown to be mainly present in the mixing controlled phase, distributed in a thin layer around the vapour fuel in the jet, within the diffusion flame location. OH radicals could be seen as early as 0.4 ms before the pre-mixed heat-release spike and until the end of apparent heat release. In the conditions studied, the diffusion flame therefore spans most of the combustion process, starting very soon after auto-ignition.\r\nFinally, high-speed videos of the flame luminosity were used to monitor the evolution of the flame and form the basis of corrections to the NO-LIF distributions. The first visible signs of combustion (carbon oxidation) matched the time and the location of the onset of the diffusion flame.","bibo:AuthorList":["Demory, R.","Crua, C.","Gold, M.R.","Heikal, M.R."],"dc:date":"2006-06-26","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Allen MG, McManus KR, Sonnenfroh DM and Paul PH.

{"identifier":103719,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Sheffield is not sexy","bibo:abstract":"The city of Sheffield’s attempts, during the early 1980s, at promoting economic regeneration through popular cultural production were unconsciously suggestive of later creative industries strategies. Post-work economic policies, which became significant to the Blair government a decade later, were evident in urban centres such as Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield in nascent form. The specificity of Sheffield’s socio-economic \r\nconfiguration gave context, not merely to its industrial narrative but also to the city’s auditory culture, which was to frame well intended though subsequently flawed strategies for regeneration. Unlike other cities, most notably Manchester, the city’s mono-cultural characteristics failed to provide an effective entrepreneurial infrastructure on which to build immediate economic response to economic rationalisation and regional decline. \r\nTop-down municipal policies, which embraced the city’s popular music, gave centrality to cultural production in response to a deflated regional economy unable, at the time, to sustain rejuvenation through cultural consumption. Such embryonic strategies would subsequently become formalised though creative industry policies developing relationships with local economies as opposed to urban engineering through regional government. \r\nBuilding upon the readings of industrial cities such as Liverpool, New Orleans and Chicago, the post-work leisure economy has increasingly addressed the significance of the auditory effect in cities such as Manchester and Sheffield. However the failure of the talismanic National Centre for Popular Music signifies the inherent problems of institutionalizing popular cultural forms and resistance of sound to be anchored and contained. The city’s sonic narrative became contained in its distinctive patterns of cultural production and consumption that ultimately resisted attempts at compartmentalization and representation through what became colloquially known as ‘the museum of popular music’. A personal narrative that is inextricably bound up in the \r\nconstruction of the city’s sound has informed many aspects of the article, providing subjective context to the broader discourse, that of sound and the city image.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mallinder, S."],"dc:date":"2007-09-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A McCann.

A review of trials funded by two UK funding agencies","bibo:abstract":"A commonly reported problem with the conduct of multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is that recruitment is often slower or more difficult than expected, with many trials failing to reach their planned sample size within the timescale and funding originally envisaged. The aim of this study was to explore factors that may have been associated with good and poor recruitment in a cohort of multicentre trials funded by two public bodies: the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme.\r\nThe cohort of trials was identified from the administrative databases held by the two funding bodies. 114 trials that recruited participants between 1994 and 2002 met the inclusion criteria. The full scientific applications and subsequent trial reports submitted by the trial teams to the funders provided the principal data sources. Associations between trial characteristics and recruitment success were tested using the Chi-squared test, or Fisher\u0027s exact test where appropriate.\r\nLess than a third (31%) of the trials achieved their original recruitment target and half (53%) were awarded an extension. The proportion achieving targets did not appear to improve over time. The overall start to recruitment was delayed in 47 (41%) trials and early recruitment problems were identified in 77 (63%) trials. The inter-relationship between trial features and recruitment success was complex. A variety of strategies were employed to try to increase recruitment, but their success could not be assessed.\r\nRecruitment problems are complex and challenging. Many of the trials in the cohort experienced recruitment difficulties. Trials often required extended recruitment periods (sometimes supported by additional funds). While this is of continuing concern, success in addressing the trial question may be more important than recruitment alone.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mcdonald, Alison M","Knight, Rosemary C","Campbell, Marion K","Entwistle, Vikki A","Grant, Adrian M","Cook, Jonathan A","Elbourne, Diana R","Francis, David","Garcia, Jo","Roberts, Ian","Snowdon, Claire"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Pocock.

These range from the routine capital projects to a one-off mega-project - Terminal 5 (T5). The paper concentrates on the learning gained from previous projects, individuals  and organisations that contributed to the innovative approach used to manage the T5 project. The T5 project uses \u0027integrated team working\u0027 to ensure that safety, time, budget and quality constraints are met. It has already reached 50% completion (March 2005) on time, within budget and with a high safety record. Under the \u0027T5 agreement\u0027, BAA holds all the risks associated with the project rather than transferring the risks to external suppliers.\r\n\r\nThe T5 project is Europe\u0027s largest and most complex project. The project, which has been called a \u0027landmark project\u0027 is also an example of a \u0027megaproject\u0027 (Flyvbjerg et al, 2003) because of it\u0027s scale, intensity and high cost and its potential to transform the practices of the UK construction industry. It is broken down into 16 major projects and 147 subprojects. At any one time the project  employs up to 6,000 workers and as many as 60, 000 people will have been involved in the project over its lifetime. The goal of the project is to increase the airport\u0027s current capacity of 67 million passengers a year to 95 million a year.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brady, Tim","Davies, Andrew","Gann, David","Rush, Howard"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.193174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.173551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.167196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.165495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.161431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.160646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5629,"sim:weight":0.138699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5941,"sim:weight":0.127897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71910,"sim:weight":0.127349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16701,"sim:weight":0.126017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.123012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.112115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82037,"sim:weight":0.11159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88518,"sim:weight":0.109364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9845,"sim:weight":0.109169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5539,"sim:weight":0.106521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88448,"sim:weight":0.105766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83001,"sim:weight":0.1017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15244,"sim:weight":0.101648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67025,"sim:weight":0.100821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At some stage however this persistent barrier to innovation may become a greater threat to progress because of changes in the internal or external environment. Which organisational practices are effective in triggering the innovation? This paper shows that successful patterns of practice depend on the nature of the innovation barrier to be breached. A study of 28 innovation projects from widely different sectors suggests a framework of three innovation barrier types; contiguous, discontinuous and persistent. Breaking through these constraints depends on matching the barrier to the appropriate mix of routine or non routine practice. Standard search routines are generally sufficient for contiguous barriers, which are straightforward ‘next steps’. Discontinuous innovation barriers require a mix of non routine practices with standard routines that can help to introduce the new. The third type, persistent innovation barriers are the obstinate problems that have become accepted as ‘the facts of life’, and must be taken out of the organisational mainstream to be resolved. The paper is illustrated with successful innovation projects where the constraints on innovation were pushed back. It also shows how a mismatch between the barrier type and organisational response creates conflicts in priorities and can undermine innovation. Implications of the research for managers and researchers are outlined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sapsed, Jonathan","John, Bessant","David, Partington","David, Tranfield","Young, Malcolm"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.57003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.461117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.425136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.421749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.413796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381996,"sim:weight":0.398784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.398156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.395015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382013,"sim:weight":0.393776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.388932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.382676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929843,"sim:weight":0.365568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.363161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9636137,"sim:weight":0.354042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45075,"sim:weight":0.331375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.322404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81882,"sim:weight":0.237402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.19587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.157319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.149816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They are generally considered helpful by parents, and objective studies report that in many different situations such courses have a positive effect on parenting.\r\no\tParents of children with special needs face particular challenges.\r\no\tThere are hardly any support courses that specifically target parents of children with special needs.\r\no\tIn children’s services work with parents more widely there is a growing emphasis on parent-professional partnerships. Most parenting support courses however, are facilitated by professionals.\r\n\r\nWhat does this project add?\r\n\r\no\tThe Insiders’ Guide parent support course is aimed specifically at parents of children with special needs.\r\no\tThe course goes a long way to meeting their learning and support needs.\r\no\tIt facilitated positive changes in parental confidence and competence (especially for those parents starting off feeling very unconfident).\r\no\tThe course was oversubscribed, popular with parents (including parents who would not normally attend such courses), and had a very low drop out rate.\r\no\tThe Insiders’ Guide course is co-facilitated by parents and professionals.\r\no\tCourse facilitators valued the experience and most felt that it improved their parenting and/or practice.\r\no\tThe evaluation provides evidence to suggest that the parent-professional facilitator partnership model is effective.\r\n\r\no\tWhat do we still need to find out?\r\no\tHow the Insiders’ Guide matches up when directly compared to other forms of parenting support.\r\no\tWhether or not the positive effect of the course is sustained over time.\r\no\tWhether a group of entirely unconfident parents would find the course helpful.\r\n\r\nWhat aspects of the course would it be most worth taking away and copying in other contexts?\r\n\r\no\tParent support course planners might usefully note that the combination of support, psychological reflection, information and education worked well.\r\no\tIt is worth investing in the detail. Pre-visiting prospective course participants in their own homes prior to them signing up is particularly helpful for getting less confident parents along to the course. Providing nice refreshments, a pleasant environment and a take home gift were highly appreciated.\r\no\tThe co-delivery model of the course (by a professional and a parent facilitator) was very effective and popular with participants and facilitators. It could be harnessed by children’s services to meet policy and practice objectives of partnership working in other contexts.\r\no\tIntensive co-training of facilitators appears to be crucial in ensuring this success.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hart, Angie","Virgo, S","Aumann, K"],"dc:date":"2006-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P McGill, E Papachristoforou and V Cooper.

In this paper I consider some of the literature which traces this\r\nassociation of landscape with the sense of sight. I focus on the suggestion that notions and concepts related to landscape are symptomatic of a pervasive ‘ocular-centrism’\r\nwithin western thought. I then highlight the ocular-centric approach to landscape which permeates much of the landscape and environmental-perception literature. \r\nConcerns are raised that the ocular-centric legacy of landscape may occlude alternative aspects of how the land is sensed and interacted with. I therefore proceed to explore research which addresses the ‘non-visual’ embodied aspects of our interactions with the land. It seems that sight isn’t necessarily the primary medium through which we come to know and organize our understandings of the land. In\r\nparticular I address the potential of recent attempts to re-conceptualize landscape as an ‘interaction’ or as ‘a moment in a process’ and in doing so question to what extent\r\nit is possible to move beyond landscape’s ocular-centrism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Macpherson, H.M.","Tress, G.","Fry, G.","Opdam, P."],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Appleton.

The aims of the research were to firstly; review the current academic debate on community participation in\r\nlandscape planning and management, secondly; reveal the current state of community participation within the NECF at both a strategic and local level and thirdly; consider the range of possible factors which determine the nature and\r\nextent of this community participation. This was achieved through a literature review, policy document analysis and in-depth interviews with individual NECF practitioners. Particular consideration was given to how individual practitioners might affect participatory processes. Research findings reveal participation practices within the NECF tend to focus on ‘creating and enjoying’ not ‘planning and managing’. This local, rather than strategic approach to participation was found to be more compatible with the 90 % private land ownership that the NECF has to work with. The study concludes, that research which focuses on practitioners as forming the major barrier to enhancing community participation is unjustified in the case of the NECF. To enhance participation practice the multiple social,\r\neconomic and material factors which converge to determine participatory processes within the NECF must be addressed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Macpherson, H.M."],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Agyeman and B Evans.

It is intended to inform the development of appropriate activities and indicators for the Bernard van Leer Foundation’s Social inclusion and respect for diversity issue area, particularly those which address the use of music in projects with young children. The study begins with an overview of musical development from prenatal to eight years of age and provides a review of the significant processes and outcomes of music education activities aimed at bringing together children in divided contexts. It is apparent that cross-community development of music skills has been and continues to be an effective means of addressing prejudice with young people. The study includes the analysis of interviews with 16 experienced practitioners in Northern Ireland regarding ways in which music plays a part in facilitating respect and inclusion with young people, and an analysis of five children’s focus groups. It concludes with recommendations to bring this knowledge to the early childhood and lower primary school sector and offers some questions for further study.","bibo:AuthorList":["Odena, O"],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G W Allport.

However, the risk management literature relating to E-Gov development projects is minimal compared with traditional Information System (IS) development projects. The success or failure of such projects depends on a number of obstacles to be overcome. Traditionally project actors use checklist, brainstorming, questionnaires, and workshop/focus-group to identify risk in IS development projects, and this research uses a similar approach applied in E-Gov development projects. This experiment investigates and attempts to use a causal core model known as CorMod to facilitate the applicability of applying a causal core model in a workshop/focus group environment to enhance the identification and analysis process of risk in the early stages of E-Gov development projects. The model/tool was based on the techniques of causal maps and has been used previously in three different traditional case studies of IS development projects with encouraging results. The model/tool combines different approaches such as brainstorming, questionnaires, and workshop/focus-groups. These methods have been used in IS traditional development projects, however, this research is concerned with their applicability within E-Gov development projects. One feature of CorMod is its ability to structure risk factors in development projects. This experiment, using CorMod, was conducted in the early stages of a large scale E-Gov development project based in Kuwait. The case study was conducted at a government agency within the government of Kuwait in charge on executing the national E-Gov program in the country. One main objective of this experiment is to improve the assessment of risk management approach in E-Gov development projects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Shehab, A.","Al-Fozan, Thalaya","Montibeller, Gilberto","Hughes, R.","Winstanley, G."],"dc:date":"2009-06-29","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Fran Ackermann and Colin Eden.

Changes in the way estates were conceived reflected changes in the concept of the city as a public arena. The alienation associated with the abstract spatial strategies of CIAM was replaced by new strategies that emphasised new visions of domestic urban street-life. In London, the last phase of this process saw the re-introduction of the street and terrace. Experiments with low-rise high-density housing proposed a humane public realm that can be seen as a culmination of an interest in public street-life that began with the Parallel of Art and Life exhibition. This project seeks to look at their perceived failure, interrogating both the intentions of the architects and planners and the resulting of their completion. Two key estates are used as case studies, each with differing configurations and consequent results.\r\n\r\nThe paper shows that while attempts were made to normalise the spaces of housing estates, in other ways they reinforced their status as ‘other territories’. These places remain ‘other’ defined by their condition as estates and as surviving fragments of old ideologies. An historical review will be combined with observations of how the public spaces are used today. This will achieve two aims: one, to re-read the projects in terms of Michel de Certeau’s optimistic notion of the everyday (appropriation as resistive practice); two, to reveal the contradictions of both the estates and the notion of heterotopia. It is believed that this analysis will show that these estates both link up with and cut themselves off from the city. Additionally, by looking at the heterotopic conditions of these estates, the problematic aspects of difference will be highlighted (when should difference be celebrated and when should sameness be sought?)","bibo:AuthorList":["Diaz, Luis"],"dc:date":"2005-05-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382003,"sim:weight":0.473694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930888,"sim:weight":0.458676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.45442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2700,"sim:weight":0.449944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.44723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.42985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.415181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.399077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.393712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.386346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352197,"sim:weight":0.383231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98889,"sim:weight":0.381091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930473,"sim:weight":0.380554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634697,"sim:weight":0.375618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382032,"sim:weight":0.365756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382031,"sim:weight":0.346554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313628,"sim:weight":0.343355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98899,"sim:weight":0.334166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45332,"sim:weight":0.331479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.330172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, progress has been somewhat sidetracked by disputes over the definition and purpose of routines, to the neglect of understanding where they come from and how they develop. Moreover, there are few empirical examples that explicitly attempt to trace the formation and development of organisational routines. This paper outlines evidence from a year-long ethnographic study of a recently formed company that was established to implement small-scale innovation projects. It offered a natural experiment through which attempts to establish new routines for innovation could be observed. To help structure these observations, the paper revisits the original distinction between the cognitive, motivational, and normative dimensions of routines made by Nelson and Winter (1982) and explores the dynamics between them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marshall, Nick","Tsekouras, George","Anna, Maron"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M C Becker.

This huge figure does not complete the whole sanpro market however, as there are a wide variety of reusable products also available. The disposable market has a great, negative environmental impact in terms of energy to produce (‘Life Cycle Assessment of Sanitary Pads and Tampons’, Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm, 2006) and end of life waste, it is therefore timely for a new, more environmentally friendly product suitable for a wide spectrum of women. \r\n\t\r\nThis paper will investigate the essential properties and requirements of the textile required for a new sanitary product and will determine how relevant these properties are in terms of user experience both for wear and for disposal or after care. \r\n\r\nTwo main products are investigated; disposable sanitary towels and reusable sanitary towels. Examining the physical characteristics such as absorbency, wicking, density and antimicrobial properties of the textile gives an indication of the suitability of the material choices. Users’ experience is also explored, as experiential data such as perceived comfort, dryness and reliability can only be determined by using the products. Research techniques have included focus groups and questionnaires. \r\n\r\nThis paper will establish the key criteria for external sanitary protection based on research and investigation into traditional and newly developed textiles with a focus on the importance of women’s experience of existing product.","bibo:AuthorList":["Darbyshire, Sally","Hicks, Toni"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.200207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634695,"sim:weight":0.178264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.173775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102591,"sim:weight":0.168652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3170,"sim:weight":0.166472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387205,"sim:weight":0.164899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.164796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.159687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.159646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.157868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.153365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101355,"sim:weight":0.148337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.143983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18732,"sim:weight":0.143708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103310,"sim:weight":0.136585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.131391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101474,"sim:weight":0.129711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98863,"sim:weight":0.124573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.124355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.12159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":103746,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Developing a Product for the Feminine Hygiene Sector","bibo:abstract":"In recent years there has been increased awareness of waste issues in the UK. Government funded organisations such as WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Program) set up in 2000, operate in the UK to raise awareness and have set up training programmes like Rethink Waste  to help companies reduce waste and improve resource efficiency. \r\n\r\nThe issue of waste is also very much in the public’s eye. Many well-known brands such as Kenco  and Innocent  have taken measures to reduce the impact their products have on the environmental damage associated with landfill waste . Because of this, many people are rethinking the products they buy and are purchasing products, which have better implications for the environment . One such user market that contributes over 200,000 tonnes  of waste per year in the UK is the feminine hygiene sector. This market produces huge quantities of disposable products from intimate feminine wipes to tampons and sanitary towels. All of the end-of-life waste of these products goes to landfill, or if flushed down the toilet will end up blocking sewers and littering beaches . \r\n\r\nThe menstrual cup, a reusable device that collects rather than absorbs menstrual blood has helped many women to change their habits, stopping over 700 million  disposable tampons going to landfill or sea littering. However, one of the existing problems with the menstrual cup for some women is that it is an internally worn device, which some women cannot use for reasons such as gynaecological conditions, vaginal discomfort or religious/cultural beliefs. With no other externally worn product on the market offering a similarly innovative solution to the Mooncup, there is an opportunity to develop a product for these women. \r\n\r\nThis paper explores the product development process of this alternative product. It will discuss how the first stage of the process, Concept Formulation, plays an important role in the development of a new product. It will also cover the following topics;\r\n\r\n•\tthe market research involved in such a vast, varied and generally unknown market\r\n•\tthe reluctance of many women to discuss a subject which affects them on a monthly basis\r\n•\tthe materials and innovations being made in similar markets such as nappies and incontinence pads\r\n•\tissues related with developing a reusable product that will be comfortable, convenient, durable, cost effective and environmentally superior over disposable products, in terms of waste and energy reduction.\r\n\r\nAlong with developing an alternative product to the menstrual cup, building a New Product Development (NPD) process for the company is an important aspect of the KTP project. This NPD structured process will allow Mooncup to expand their product range and grow successfully in a sustainable and thoroughly considered way in the future. Throughout the paper, the development of the NPD Process for Mooncup will be considered, as it is being built upon as the KTP project progresses. \r\n\r\nThe paper will conclude with the completed outcomes of the concept formulation stage of the NPD process. The main outcome being the decision on what the type of product will be designed over the remainder of the KTP project.","bibo:AuthorList":["Darbyshire, Sally"],"dc:date":"2011-05-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101474,"sim:weight":0.375642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98863,"sim:weight":0.352185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":400,"sim:weight":0.312516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102591,"sim:weight":0.310479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103310,"sim:weight":0.289865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.257042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.254687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3170,"sim:weight":0.247729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.245953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.245953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.240619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91147,"sim:weight":0.239628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.233017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.230864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.230864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.21526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.212843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.212588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109365,"sim:weight":0.19971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.191755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this contemporary retail atmosphere of “pile it high: sell it cheap” and “quick to market”, even designer goods have achieved a throwaway status. This modern culture of consumerism is the antithesis of sustainability and is proving a dilemma surrounding sustainable practice for designers and producers in the disciplines (de Blas, 2010). Design researchers including those in textiles/fashion have begun to explore what is a key question in the 21st century in order to create a vision and reason for their disciplines: Can products be designed to have added value to the consumer and hence contribute to a more sustainable industry? Fashion Textiles Design has much to answer for in contributing to the problems of unsustainable practices on a global scale in design, production and waste. However, designers within this field also have great potential to contribute to practical ‘real world’ solutions. ----- ----- This paper provides an overview of some of the design and technological developments from the fashion/textiles industry, endorsing a model where designers and technicians use their transferrable skills for wellbeing rather than desire. Smart materials in the form of responsive and adaptive fibres and fabrics combined with electro active devices, and ICT are increasingly shaping many aspects of society particularly in the leisure industry and interactive consumer products are ever more visible in healthcare. Combinations of biocompatible delivery devices with bio sensing elements can create analyse, sense and actuate early warning and monitoring systems which can be linked to data logging and patient records via intelligent networks. Patient sympathetic, ‘smart’ fashion/textiles applications based on interdisciplinary expertise utilising textiles design and technology is emerging. An analysis of a series of case studies demonstrates the potential of fashion textiles design practitioners to exploit the concept of value adding through technological garment and textiles applications and enhancement for health and wellbeing and in doing so contribute to a more sustainable future fashion/textiles design industry.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farrer, Joan","Finn, A"],"dc:date":"2011-03-29","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"i O\u0027Loughlin and S.

The transfer of the production of garments to overseas workers has had consequences for the wellbeing of local businesses, fashion designers and garment makers. The gradual decline of fashion manufacturing also appears to have resulted in a local fashion scene where many garments look the same in style, colour, fabric, cut and fit. The excitement of the past, where the majority of fashion designers established their own individuality through the cut and shape of the garments that they produced, may have been inadvertently lost in an effort to take advantage of cost savings achieved through mass production and manufacturing methods which are now largely unavailable in New Zealand. Consequently, a sustainable local fashion and manufacturing industry, with design integrity, seems further out of reach. This paper is focussed upon the thesis that the design and manufacture of a fashion garment, bearing in mind certain economic and practical restrictions at its inception, can contribute to a more sustainable fashion manufacturing industry in New Zealand.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farrer, Joan","Finn, A"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2104,"sim:weight":0.245458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634728,"sim:weight":0.204208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103749,"sim:weight":0.192326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103748,"sim:weight":0.192262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3170,"sim:weight":0.142761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103310,"sim:weight":0.141538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.140704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.125776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1927598,"sim:weight":0.118611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.118604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":795084,"sim:weight":0.116744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32432,"sim:weight":0.113237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9847,"sim:weight":0.113218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9845,"sim:weight":0.108747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88839,"sim:weight":0.106613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.106526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71910,"sim:weight":0.105204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.103431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.100366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26473,"sim:weight":0.0994758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is associated with professional development which could give access to Qualified Teacher Status. This part-time, school-based route is consistent with the growth of alternative routes into teaching that are based on an ‘apprenticeship model of teacher training’. This model is consistent with the dominant model of ‘reflective practice’ in teacher training. This study of a cohort of students in their first year of a part-time degree programme for TAs examines the role of experience from constructivist and sociocultural perspectives. It concludes that the TAs’ social context in school has a significant impact on the potential to learn from experience and this needs to be addressed in the design of such programmes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edmond, N"],"dc:date":"2003-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The immediate aim is to raise a number of issues – and hopefully controversies – that will contribute to a lively and informative conference. The paper is in three parts. In the first it reviews the milestones along the road of educational reform since the 1990s with a particular focus upon issues of school quality, effectiveness and improvement. In the second it discusses – with examples from a range of countries in which the author has worked – six key challenges we now face. The third part looks briefly at methodological developments and in particular the increasing importance attached to culturally appropriate approaches to researching and evaluating educational reform. It also outlines the case for making greater use of two research methods - life history, and narrative enquiry - in the quest for more meaningful evidence-gathering and analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stephens, D"],"dc:date":"2008-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Benavot.

The literature reveals sustainable business continues to be the focus of considerable academic interest, as well as practical importance. Interviews with seven local hospitality and tourism enterprises in the West of England provided valuable insights into the benefits of the scheme. These were related to environmental impacts, financial considerations, marketing opportunities, brand recognition and company image, and other issues such as public relations, personal moral responsibility, and political considerations. Challenges included several internal and external factors potentially preventing businesses from joining the GTBS, such as a lack of respondent knowledge of the sustainable tourism concept, the perceived expense of applying for and/or membership, a lack of time to complete the application process, and the amount of work involved in compliance. Recommendations to facilitate and encourage future membership included more information about the scheme and its marketing advantages, the need for regional organisations to spend more money on promoting the GTBS brand, and the necessity of educating consumers on the importance of sustainability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jarvis, N.","Weeden, C.","Simcock, N."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Being a chef is more than just a job, it is sacred work involving sacrifice and pain leaving a physical imprint on the individual in the form of burns, cuts and scalds. Such marks are the physical manifestation of chef culture.\r\n\r\nResearch limitations/implications – The findings are not generalizable to all chefs. Further research should focus on issues of gender and ethnicity, and on chefs working in different types of establishment and at different levels/status to those interviewed here.\r\n\r\nOriginality/value – The findings and the analysis provide valuable insights into chef identity. This analysis is important because the significance of concepts such as culture and identity for understanding specific job roles is still under explored within a hospitality context. Managers need to be able to understand and work with the cultural dynamics inherent in job roles because these impinge on key issues such as recruitment, retention and team building of all staff, not just chefs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Palmer, C.A.","Cooper, J.","Burns, P.M."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Barth.

A content analysis of representations of parenting in young children\u0027s picturebooks","bibo:abstract":"Although sex-role stereotyping in children’s books is a consistent focus of research, the study of the gender role stereotyping of parenting in children’s media is less common, despite a developing academic interest in the changing social meanings of fathering and mothering in contemporary societies. Previous analysis, though scarce, has suggested that fathers are under-represented in general and when present, are less likely to be seen expressing affection towards, or caring for, children than mothers. In this study we revisited representations of mothers and fathers in children’s picturebooks, updating previous research via numerous methodological developments. A content analysis of a representative sample of all young children’s picturebooks featuring representations of parents was undertaken. The results offered qualified support for previous research, and found additional differences in terms of presence around the home, emotional expression, appearances with, and contact with, children. The significance of the finding of no difference between parental sex in terms of childcare activity and explicit nurturing activity is considered in terms of a possible shift from invisible to involved fatherhood.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, Matthew","Walker, Carl","O\u0027Connell, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A M Allen, D N Allen and G Sigler.

This interrogation takes as its starting point the notion that interior architecture is a recently formed discipline. From this point of view the discipline’s relationship to history becomes clearly distinct from architecture’s. While this approach may give rise to certain problems, it also opens up a critical opportunity to challenge deeply embedded historiographical notions such as typology and chronology. \r\nThe key data consists of a selective review of architectural (and some interior design) histories outlining challenges to approaches in architectural history. The general problems of historiography gleaned from these critiques are used to develop guidelines for a history of interior architecture. The argument will outline key ideas in historiography focusing on Banham, Foucault and Tafuri. Key concepts will be identified such as the idea of operative history, critical history and microhistory. The argument will then suggest an approach which reflects (or rejects) these key concepts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Diaz, Luis"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This paper uses Sevenhuijsen’s (2003) ‘Trace’ approach to explore the use of the concept of ‘family’ across a number of interrelated social policy streams.

However, they have a darker side. Structure influences behavior, with the large and slow moving influencing the small and fast moving more than vice versa. In this paper it is argued that the structural and systemic features of Learning Management Systems and their uses in higher education may lead to the domination of the teacher and the learner by the system designers, the managers and the institution, an educational Fordism which may not always be in the best interests of the learner.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the ACE I/D frequency in different populations and geographic location; ACE I/D allele frequency in the Lebanese population and ACE II genotype contribution to the geographic trend were also identified. Five hundred and seventy healthy volunteers were recruited from the Lebanese population. Genomic DNA was extracted from buccal cells, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction; products were then identified by gel electrophoresis. The frequencies of the different ACE I/D genotypes were determined and tested for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). To assess the relationship between ACE I/D frequency and geographic location, and to identify how the Lebanese\r\npopulation contributes to the geographic trend in ACE I/D frequencies, Eurasian population samples and Asians were incorporated in the analyses from the literature. The frequency of the I allele in the Lebanese population was 27% and the corresponding II genotype was at a frequency of 7.37% (in HWE; P\u003d0.979). The ACE I allele and genotype frequencies show an association with\r\nlongitude, with frequencies increasing eastwards and westwards from the Middle East.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saab, Y.B","Gard, P.R","Overall, A.D.J"],"dc:date":"2007-08","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Al-Eisa, M Z Haider and B S Srivastva.

Factions within the field have emerged as the field has struggled to find a new identity for what social psychology is. In spite of recent efforts to forge connections across these paradigmatical territories many academics remain locked in perpetual disagreement to this day.This new book proposes a way out of the crisis by letting go of the idea that psychology needs new foundations or a new identity, whether biological, discursive, or cognitive. The psychological is not narrowly confined to any one aspect of human experience; it is quite literally everywhere. Drawing on a range of influential thinkers including Michel Serres, Michel Foucault, AN Whitehead and Gilles Deleuze, the book proposes a strong process-oriented approach to the psychological which studies events or occasions. Aspects of experience such as communication or embodiment are treated as thoroughly mediated – the product of multiple intersecting relationships between the biological, the psychic, and the social. The outcome is an image of a ‘mobile’ reflexively founded discipline which follows the psychological wherever it takes us, from the depths of embodiment to the complexities of modern global politics.The critically important new text is written in a way that is accessible for undergraduate students as well as more advanced readers and could be an exciting gateway into a new understanding of the rich, historical discipline of psychology","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Stephen D.","Stenner, Paul"],"dc:date":"2009-07-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Obtaining dynamic information about the neurotransmission process (specifically the release and reuptake of 5-HT) requires the development of new approaches to measure the extracellular 5-HT concentration profile. In this work constant-potential amperometry has been utilised at +650 mV vs. Ag|AgCl to measure in vitro the overflow of 5-HT. Steady-state levels of 5-HT have been observed, due to continuous mechanical stimulation of the tissue from the experimental protocol. Measurements are conducted at varying tissue–electrode distances in the range of 5 to 1100 µm. The difference in the current from the bulk media and that from each tissue–electrode distance is obtained, and the natural log of this current is plotted versus the tissue–electrode distance. The linear fit to the log of the current is derived, and its intercept, I0, with the vertical axis and its slope are calculated. The reciprocal of the slope, indicated as slope−1, is used as a marker of reuptake. The ratio between intercept, I0, and the reciprocal of the slope, I0/slope−1, is a measure of the flux at the tissue surface and it can be used as a marker for the 5-HT release rate. Current measurements for ileum and colon tissue indicated a significantly higher reuptake rate in the colon, showed by a lower slope−1. In addition, the ratio, I0/slope−1, indicated that the colon has a higher 5-HT flux compared to the ileum. Following the application of the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine, both tissues showed a higher value of slope−1, as the reuptake process is blocked preventing clearance of 5-HT. No differences were observed in the ratio, I0/slope−1, in the ileum, but a decrease was observed in the colon. These results indicate that ileum and colon are characterised by different reuptake and release processes. The new approach we propose provides pivotal information on the variations in the signalling mechanism, where steady state levels are observed and can be a vital tool to study differences between normal and diseased tissue and also the efficacy of pharmacological agents","bibo:AuthorList":["Patel, B.A.","Marcelli, G."],"dc:date":"2010-07-02","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P R Wade, J Chen, B Jaffe, I S Kassen, R D Blakely, M D Gershon and J Neurosci.

Carbon adsorbents were assessed for their in vitro cytotoxicity against a V79 cell line using a material extraction method in combination with a colony formation assay. Results were compared to those from a commercially available cellulose-coated carbon adsorbent, developed for direct haemoperfusion. Initial findings demonstrated an inhibition of colony formation and an apparent cytotoxic effect. However, it was found that this inhibition occurred as a result of protein and ion adsorption by carbon materials possessing large surface area and highly developed porous structure. Consequently, these essential nutrients were unavailable to the cells during colony formation. Modifications to the cytotoxicity assessment methods were required in order to take into account nutrient loss. Subsequently it was determined that the carbon materials do not show a cytotoxic response towards the V79 cell line under the modified conditions employed. The suggested approach may be useful in the assessment of other biomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and other nanoparticles which possess large surface area. The preliminary data support the ongoing investigation of these adsorbents as candidates for use in extracorporeal therapies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barnes, L.M","Phillips, G.J","Davies, J.G","Lloyd, A.W","Cheek, E","Tennison, S.R","Rawlinson, A.P","Kozynchenko, O.P","Mikhalovsky, S.V"],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1559968,"sim:weight":0.313994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98474,"sim:weight":0.288182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98558,"sim:weight":0.224347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661446,"sim:weight":0.177384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99002,"sim:weight":0.175168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145592,"sim:weight":0.17358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17932,"sim:weight":0.172075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.167785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384221,"sim:weight":0.159792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387350,"sim:weight":0.159284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5357459,"sim:weight":0.158251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146047,"sim:weight":0.154913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383986,"sim:weight":0.153533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.149177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930233,"sim:weight":0.143262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102703,"sim:weight":0.141976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":955497,"sim:weight":0.13883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.137515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102601,"sim:weight":0.132487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98452,"sim:weight":0.131537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

From the iconic German steel helmet to practice trenches on Salisbury Plain, and from the ‘Dazzle Ship’ phenomenon through medal-wearing, diary-writing, trophy collecting, the market in war souvenirs and the evocative reworking of European objects by African soldiers, this book presents a dazzling array of hitherto unseen worlds of the Great War.\r\n\r\nThe innovative and multidisciplinary approach adopted here follows the lead established by Nicholas J. Saunders’ Matters of Conflict (Routledge 2004), and extends its geographical coverage to embrace a truly international perspective. Australia, Africa, Italy, Germany, France, Belgium and Britain are all represented by a cross-disciplinary group of scholars working in archaeology, anthropology, cultural history, art history, museology, and cultural heritage. The result is a volume that resonates with richly documented and theoretically informed case studies that illustrate how the experiences of war can be embodied in and represented by an endless variety of artefacts, whose ‘social lives’ have endured for almost a century and that continue to shape our perceptions of an increasingly dangerous world.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moriarty, Catherine","Saunder, N","Cornish, P"],"dc:date":"2009-07-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The first artist to win a scholarship in sculpture to the British School at Rome, and a soldier in the First World War, he was a sought after sculptor of war memorials. His figurative designs of those that fought remain evocative of the Great War and its cost. The Guards\u0027 Division Memorial at Horse Guards Parade (1922-5) is his most prominent work in London and he designed sculpture for the Imperial War Graves Commission Memorial to the Missing at Ploegsteert, Belgium (1926-9). \r\n\r\nDuring the 1930s Ledward turned from the established practice of modelling in clay to carving stone direct. While other artists pioneered the development of modern sculpture, ultimately towards abstraction, Ledward\u0027s work remained figurative. His belief that sculpture had a social purpose, both as a fine and an applied art, led to his involvement in a wide range of projects. In 1934 he co-founded the firm Sculptured Memorials and Headstones in an attempt to promote carving by regional artists in native stone. He made architectural sculpture for many major buildings in the capital. \r\n\r\nProfessor of Sculpture at the Royal College of Art, elected to the Royal Academy in 1937 and a President of the RBS, Ledward was an outspoken member of the art establishment. He was involved in debates about the place of sculpture in twentieth-century society and the professional standing of the sculptor. This book examines the shift in values that Ledward found so troubling and that preoccupied him in the years after the Second World War. \r\n\r\nThe Sculpture of Gilbert Ledward places attention on the processes and practice of sculpture and reproduces many sketches and working drawings previously unpublished. It is the first comprehensive record of Ledward\u0027s work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moriarty, Catherine"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6199095,"sim:weight":0.383291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43380,"sim:weight":0.365261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43014,"sim:weight":0.318786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145750,"sim:weight":0.317715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48277,"sim:weight":0.312541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764029,"sim:weight":0.310467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43299,"sim:weight":0.304209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382007,"sim:weight":0.291935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44647,"sim:weight":0.291049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316069,"sim:weight":0.288938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43596,"sim:weight":0.286547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108601,"sim:weight":0.281512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382085,"sim:weight":0.280884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710190,"sim:weight":0.275791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43804,"sim:weight":0.271869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352197,"sim:weight":0.267071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051969,"sim:weight":0.266048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771724,"sim:weight":0.263229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.260328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382031,"sim:weight":0.248249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recent studies have identified a lack of effective entrepreneurship as a barrier to the future development of a world-class creative industries sector.\r\n\t\r\nThe Higher Education Academy has worked closely with the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts and others including the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship to find ways in which the learning environment and curriculum can be shaped to deliver more effective entrepreneurship education across the Higher Education sector and for specific subjects. The Creating Entrepreneurship project brought together a range of agencies to focus the debate on what can and needs to be done to develop effective entrepreneurship education in art, design and media subjects across the UK Higher Education sector.\r\n\r\nCreating Entrepreneurship is informed by extensive reviews of policy relating to enterprise and entrepreneurship education from Governments and government agencies across the UK and reviews of contemporary literature on entrepreneurship education. A survey of over 80 art, design and media courses determined the type and range of existing entrepreneurship education. Student and graduate focus groups in over 15 HEIs, involving around 150 students provided a Student Voice in the research.

The report includes a paper on visual research by the editor, summaries of speakers\u0027 presentations, reports on the debates by delegates and by guest student reporters.\r\n\r\nContributors to the forum debate and the report have worked with or undertaken research on visual media. David Crow’s book Left to Right discusses how pictures, rather than words, have become the dominant form of communication. Trevor Hearing worked for many years as a TV cameraman and is interested in how documentary video will be used as a “creative academic research tool”. The TechDis project offers resources to assist disabled students, many of which are focused on how visual media can assist learning. Alistair McNaught, Senior Advisor for Further Education, has been discussing how these materials might be of particular use to art, design and media students. Simon Ofield is a contributor to the journal: Visual Culture in Britain and is particularly interested in connections between spatial and visual cultures. The massive potential of mobile technologies to form social networks and digital photography has driven an exponential rise in the number of images we are attempting to manage and is part of John Piper’s work at Kodak’s European Research Labs. Finally, Anita Taylor is a teacher and painter with a particular interest in drawing as a means of creative development, not only for artists, but for all of us living and working in the knowledge economy. David Clews\u0027 introductory essay discusses these contributions and wider issues of visual research and visual thinking. His paper builds on earlier work on visual learning including a research project, Imaging in Education funded by the Eastman Kodak Research Fund.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clews, David"],"dc:date":"2008-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83543,"sim:weight":0.304759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155193,"sim:weight":0.301048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.295504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.291602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.284841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.282946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341327,"sim:weight":0.281363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.276095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.274679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.273997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.268312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10755,"sim:weight":0.267985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43635,"sim:weight":0.264992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.264806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.261405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.259877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795073,"sim:weight":0.256473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.251092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193190,"sim:weight":0.248596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.247057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Contributors were asked to create an image-based representation of their perception of sustainable design and to answer a questionnaire that questioned the viability of different sustainable design strategies and the degree of sustainable design application in relation to their practice. 2154 contributions were received from across the international and disciplinary design fields and formed a live evolving archive over the four days of the event. The information gathered represents a unique census of the industry and was disseminated and published via a book ‘Designers, Visionaries and Other Stories’ (Earthscan 2007) and online, and it fed the content for the following ‘masterclass’ series –‘100% Sustainable?’ 2007.\r\n\r\nInformed by the research gathered the subsequent event ‘100% Sustainable? – 2007’ consisted of 9 disciplinary specific master-class workshops tasked with forming ‘101 Approaches to Sustainable Design’; a resource of useable sustainable design strategies applicable to the range of design disciplines. These workshops were steered by 20 influential and internationally acclaimed design practioners, researchers and company representatives including Tejo Remy, Bill Dunster, Dr Kate Fletcher, Philips, ICI. The results and contributions gathered from the event provide, unique insights and practical tools and resources published for use by the design populace nurturing sustainable design progress within the design industry.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 the project exhibited a 96 square meter event space and scale model environment of ‘contentious’ scenarios in which exemplar, sustainable design products were presented and broadcast around the exhibition Earls Court. Four one day seminars and workshop sessions ‘Growing, Learning, Modelling and Making’ explored different approaches to Sustainability using mixes of academic and industrial participants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gant, Nick"],"dc:date":"2006-09-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":3170,"sim:weight":0.407186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.336718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.308436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.265438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.253574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.252129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The PMC was founded in 1965 to promote the art of printmaking and the work of contemporary printmakers. The membership is broad and open to work covering digital print forms, print construction bookwork, print installation and all the traditional forms of print. PMC holds regular members shows around Britain.\r\nThrough our careful selection process for this exhibition, we wanted to show work that demonstrated a rich variety of printing processes from traditional print methods such as etching to the more recent digital enhanced prints. To include the work by older and established printmakers and show work by younger artists just emerging from University; showing an eclectic mix of styles and approaches to their work and subject matter. Printmaking in\r\nBritain has gained a new vigor with the introduction of new digital possibilities and by its incorporation into traditional methods of print. The computer in print practice has driven a revaluation of approach by many artist printmakers extending practice into fields such as installation, print constructions, complex text works and book pieces, also printworks on a new epic scale. This has renewed interest in the traditional methods and strengthens the interest in the need for drawing in the new forms.\r\nThe use of digital imaging makes this an exciting, challenging, and innovative time to be an artist printmaker investigating new potentials. It also encouraged a major revaluation of printmaking processes in general; raising the issues of authenticity and ownership. These are current issues within contemporary art practice and the growth of works of art readily available on the World Wide Web, blurring the distinction between ‘original’ and ‘reproduction’.\r\nThe challenge now is to move on from the legacy of traditional print to a broader definition of its possibilities, be they in the field of art in public, art in the gallery or on the web. Creating a synergy between processes old and new opening up new areas of freedom and diversity, establishing a unique repertoire of aesthetic tools. The atmosphere among British Printmakers has become increasingly inventive and positive within print where the activity is seen as positive and inventive, the medium of the bold and possible.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martynov, Andrey","Nazansky, Vladimir","Rooms, Verle","Gollifer, Sue","Besant, Derek","Popov, Sergei","Kiyono, Koichi"],"dc:date":"2009-09-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1351671,"sim:weight":0.550128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225608,"sim:weight":0.347304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.329278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051969,"sim:weight":0.323962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.317942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105058,"sim:weight":0.315708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103460,"sim:weight":0.311702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1636448,"sim:weight":0.311538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113848,"sim:weight":0.305575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930822,"sim:weight":0.30008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.291094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771724,"sim:weight":0.282908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48277,"sim:weight":0.281964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.271337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1344239,"sim:weight":0.268498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.266856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.266004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.26488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159948,"sim:weight":0.264483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.262574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The technological, semiotic and aesthetic affinities between the two mediums only heightened a perception of the radical differences in terms of their supposed distinctive temporalities. This essay explores the writings of Kracauer, Bazin, Barthes and Metz to consider the ways in which photography and film have consistently been theorized as fundamentally distinct mediums as regards the temporalities they embody and the experiences of tense that they promote. The essay goes on to suggest that such orthodoxy is in the process of being challenged by, on the one hand, theoretical approaches that suggest that photography might involve more complex notions of time, and on the other hand, by the increasing convergence of the technologies of the moving and still image and the ways in which this has been exploited by contemporary artists.","bibo:AuthorList":["Green, David","Green, David","Lowry, Joanna"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.303803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051961,"sim:weight":0.301964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710584,"sim:weight":0.296088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46627,"sim:weight":0.295045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.288669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99028,"sim:weight":0.276504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931412,"sim:weight":0.272605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709961,"sim:weight":0.271577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.264428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.258597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.256144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45332,"sim:weight":0.254834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710586,"sim:weight":0.252252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.251165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447850,"sim:weight":0.241418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652829,"sim:weight":0.236597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352169,"sim:weight":0.236573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.2355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.234514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710188,"sim:weight":0.231798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

High-resolution monitoring of catchment hydrology and the concentrations of SS and volatile organic matter (VOM) were carried out in the first-order channel of the Den Brook headwater catchment in Devon (UK) during the 2006–2007 hydrological season. The widely used ‘rating curve’ (discharge-concentration) approach was employed to estimate yields of SS, but as demonstrated by previous researchers, this study showed that discharge is a poor predictor of SS concentrations and therefore any yields estimated from this technique are likely to be highly uncertain. Nevertheless, for the purpose of providing estimates of yields that are comparable to previous studies on other land uses/sources, this technique was adopted albeit in an uncertainty-based framework. The findings suggest that contrary to the common perception, grasslands can be erosive landscapes with SS yields from this catchment estimated to be between 0.54 and 1.21 t ha\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e y\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e. In terms of on-site erosion problems, this rate of erosion does not significantly exceed the commonly used ‘tolerable’ threshold in the UK (1 t ha\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e y\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e). In terms of off-site erosion problems, it is argued here that the conventional expression of SS yield as a bulk annual figure has little relevance to the water quality and ecological status of surface waters and therefore an alternative technique (the concentration–frequency curve) is developed within this paper for the specific purpose of assessing the ecological threat posed by the delivery of SS into surface waters. This technique illustrates that concentrations of SS recorded at the catchment outlet frequently exceed the water quality guidelines, such as those of the EU Freshwater Fisheries Directive (78/659/EC), and pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms. It is suggested that failure to recognise improved temperate grasslands as a potential source of particulate material could result in the non-compliance of surface waters to water quality guidelines, deterioration of ecological status and failure of water quality remediation measures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bilotta, G.S.","Krueger, T.","Brazier, R.E.","Butler, P.","Freer, J.","Hawkins, J.M.B.","Macleod, C.J.A.","Quinton, J.N."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60643,"sim:weight":0.467393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61637,"sim:weight":0.44336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60630,"sim:weight":0.436245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":92218,"sim:weight":0.403675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108092,"sim:weight":0.399713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.3958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.395791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.378333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":383348,"sim:weight":0.354441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108951,"sim:weight":0.349625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60661,"sim:weight":0.347817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.347332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63007,"sim:weight":0.338818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387005,"sim:weight":0.329376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":359802,"sim:weight":0.328623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384788,"sim:weight":0.326464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62195,"sim:weight":0.318066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62968,"sim:weight":0.317851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63533,"sim:weight":0.316651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.312006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

(Laurance, 2004) The average British woman has a proportionally larger stomach and waist than her 1950’s counterpart, and is a size 16.    Paradoxically, women of size 16 and above find clothes shopping frustrating, humiliating and fruitless. (Shabi, 2004) This contiguity presents an interesting and novel area of investigation.\r\nUK consumers spend £23 billion a year on clothing , when viewed in the context that two thirds of British women are overweight (Laurance, 2004) , a picture develops of a dissatisfied yet growing market.\r\n\r\nAims and Outcomes\r\nIs the primary value of knitted fabric on larger bodies its inherent stretch? This research questions whether such a method of achieving fit is satisfactory by exploring shaping methods in combination with direct body shape data. It also challenges the ‘norm’ of the size 12 woman, (disproved by SizeUK findings)   and the horror of fat which is demonstrated from haute couture (Evans, 2003, p85-96) to the high street (Shabi, 2004). \r\nOutcomes are anticipated to include creating a vocabulary common to both designers and technicians, thereby enabling the production of bespoke knitwear for larger women.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nCase study, qualitative methodologies allow multi-method, reflexive and evolving research within a selected participant group, whilst siting the question in its real-world setting. (Marshall and Rossman, 1999)  A pilot study has commenced, the results of which will be available by June 2005. \r\nAn electronic survey, derived from the Heath Carter endomorphic somatotypes, (Carter, 1980) is gathering additional body shape information.\r\n\r\nMeasuring\r\nMeasuring the body is by traditional methods and exact body ‘clones’ of the participants facilitate experiments. Measurements are between pre-established landmarks; negative spaces are gauged and stance documented, establishing the body’s proportional girth and silhouette. Drawings, photographs and video provide a visual record and data for knit prototyping. \r\n\r\nKnitting \r\nSamples are knitted on a 12gge Shima Seiki 102ff machine and SDS1 system at the University of Brighton. This versatility pursues a thread of the research; enabling bespoke knitwear through a dynamic, digital relationship with the consumer.\r\nConsistency of yarn is established, which pre-supposes the price point of custom made knitwear will initially justify a quality fibre. (Berry, 2000).\r\nSingle jersey is the selected structure; it is supple and not as complex to ‘read’ as other structures when shaped around the body. Purl fabric constructions provide permanent surface-pattern-to-stitch ratios to show distortion. (Smirfitt, 1975), (Spencer, 1983) Narrowing, increasing, stitch quality, gathering, progressive doubling and flèchage will add three dimensional shape.\r\nTests of knitted shapes on the body will make particular note of wrinkling, strain, bulk, flare and drape.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nRelationships between body shape and fabric is currently found to be the most contentious over protruding parts of the body, specifically bust, hips, stomach and particularly around the shoulders. Space between body and knitting over concave body areas is directly influenced by the degree of ease introduced elsewhere. The investigation of ease and its application to specific areas represents the ongoing practical content of the research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haffenden, V.M."],"dc:date":"2005-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8078,"sim:weight":0.513093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1123059,"sim:weight":0.264637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1123020,"sim:weight":0.232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771695,"sim:weight":0.227568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102639,"sim:weight":0.221239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.206968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9340286,"sim:weight":0.197871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771838,"sim:weight":0.191055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634695,"sim:weight":0.179869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.176143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634214,"sim:weight":0.176005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101412,"sim:weight":0.170499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.168852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.168852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.168852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.168852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.168852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.168852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.168852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.168852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They analyse\r\nevidence for how intergenerational dynamics interact with HIV-related vulnerability, through the likely influence of being AIDS-affected on vulnerability to HIV infection, and through intergenerational reproductions of structural disadvantages and social determinants of HIV vulnerability. They review evidence of AIDS’ impacts on children and of contextual influences on their vulnerability to infection, linked to\r\norphaning, inequality and lack of education. They point to the paucity of longitudinal research into this area and challenges in uncovering structural determinants of vulnerability. Pressure for generalised ‘hard’ evidence in global policy fails to capture context-specific dynamics. Focus shifts from the notion of children\r\nas passive ‘objects’ of study to one that includes ‘agency’ as central to adolescents maturing and interacting with multiple challenges.

The Samoa Plan for 1992-2001 is a typical example of this problem, which has wider implications for other SIDS. The paper undertakes, from a historical perspective, a detailed critical analysis of the plan (undertaken by the then EU Tourism Council of the South Pacific) concluding that a) the flaws and contradictions in tourism master planning could have been avoided by a more careful reading of classic planning texts from as early as the 1960s, and b) the plans are too complicated, take little account of local sensibilities, and fail to recognise the balance that needs to be struck between national plans and the regional context in geographic locations where individual island states are, in effect, too small to ignore intra-regional cooperation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burns, P.M."],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The methodology draws on in-depth interviews and participant observation of significant actors in the tourism sector. The research findings suggest that understanding the intricate political system and power structure in a society is the key to understanding sustainable tourism policy development, planning and implementation. In the case of North Cyprus, policy development was found to be a product of political influence (referred to as ego-driven politics in the text), specifically the use of public resources as an instrument for political power, retention and that the politicisation of the public sector is the underlying cause of the weakened progress in sustainable tourism development. It is therefore essential to have a clear understanding of political issues, key political actors’ interests and how to mitigate personal interests to facilitate and maintain sustainable tourism development in such small states.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yasarata, M.","Altinay, L.","Burns, P.M.","Okumus, F."],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77045,"sim:weight":0.786527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101270,"sim:weight":0.777744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222808,"sim:weight":0.771526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101516,"sim:weight":0.770252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101263,"sim:weight":0.723972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.679731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77201,"sim:weight":0.677678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75287,"sim:weight":0.576216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101372,"sim:weight":0.498153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.436049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187512,"sim:weight":0.384278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108611,"sim:weight":0.345416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45075,"sim:weight":0.286496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709917,"sim:weight":0.28216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381989,"sim:weight":0.275884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.273608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.273445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.270843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.247999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.244187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, everyday life, with everyday mobilities and everyday risk are more often the predominant concern of the majority of citizens in the West (Tulloch and Lupton 2003). This paper is situated at this more local level, aimed at understanding a microcosm of everyday life: the corporeal mobilities of the journey to school, drawing out broader implications for a society shaped by both risk and mobility. In particular, the discussion here follows on from Jenkins’ (2006) paper on risk, parenting and young people in using socio-cultural theory to question the assumptions made about parental management of risks to their children and particularly theories of ‘paranoid parenting’ (Furedi 2001). It is argued here that it is localised everyday risk discourses, and their construction according to gender and generation, that are most signiﬁcant in shaping mobility","bibo:AuthorList":["Murray, Lesley"],"dc:date":"2009-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100371,"sim:weight":0.404066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":396926,"sim:weight":0.365675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48857,"sim:weight":0.328229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.303196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10612,"sim:weight":0.280166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15490,"sim:weight":0.264834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47248,"sim:weight":0.262005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145729,"sim:weight":0.257674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187769,"sim:weight":0.245284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1344737,"sim:weight":0.22785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.223777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98868,"sim:weight":0.215497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101412,"sim:weight":0.210284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86094,"sim:weight":0.204781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2473,"sim:weight":0.204397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15542,"sim:weight":0.204246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43663,"sim:weight":0.20255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020996,"sim:weight":0.20154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15434,"sim:weight":0.200995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.197597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Policy initiatives associated with inclusion, tackling teacher workloads and the reformation of children and young people’s services have resulted in a proliferation and diversification of roles in schools with the creation of new ‘associate professional’ roles such as ‘higher level teaching assistants’, ‘cover supervisors’, ‘learning mentors’ and ‘parent support advisors’. The ‘extended schools agenda’ has also seen groups such as counsellors, mental health workers and social workers brought into schools. In a context of modernisation and workforce remodelling there has also been a blurring of boundaries between previously distinct roles. This paper provides an analysis of these developments and considers the implications for notions of expertise and professionalism in the\r\nchildren and young people’s workforce, and for pastoral care in schools in particular. Professional development and accreditation for these roles present a mixed picture in which foundation degrees have an important part to play, but for which there is equivocal government support. The use of ‘professional standards’ premised on a model of competence deriving from work-based learning raises important questions about the nature of professional expertise in professional practice relating to pastoral issues. At the same time as it is proposed to raise the status of teaching to ‘masters’ level, the neediest and most problematic children in schools are increasingly likely to be working with\r\nlower paid, lower status staff who may have no formally recognised qualifications. The implications of this for the pastoral care function in schools are explored.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edmond, N","Price, M"],"dc:date":"2009-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4157530,"sim:weight":0.462545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47016,"sim:weight":0.428018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106236,"sim:weight":0.42624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155211,"sim:weight":0.411272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159877,"sim:weight":0.410781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157532,"sim:weight":0.39622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154291,"sim:weight":0.395631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99936,"sim:weight":0.391785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4150567,"sim:weight":0.38424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154587,"sim:weight":0.37958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155807,"sim:weight":0.374844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151293,"sim:weight":0.365931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156367,"sim:weight":0.354468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159119,"sim:weight":0.347277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157832,"sim:weight":0.341983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154182,"sim:weight":0.332037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158350,"sim:weight":0.328169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157831,"sim:weight":0.32801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157829,"sim:weight":0.320085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156007,"sim:weight":0.319679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A microelectrode array was used to monitor proton concentration and histamine levels from isolated guinea pig stomach tissue. The device was partially modified using iridium oxide to form a series of pH sensors, whereas unmodified gold microelectrodes were used to measure the level of histamine in the gut. Real-time measurements in the presence of the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine produced significant decreases in the overall  pH response, as expected. Also, a significant variation in the  pH response in between pH sensors was observed in the presence of pharmacological treatment due to structural features of the tissue. No significant differences in iH were detected in the presence of ranitidine as expected. More significantly, clear variations in  pH responses between animals in control conditions and those in the presence of ranitidine was observed highlighting possible variation in parietal cell density and/or variations in tissue activity. These results identify great possibilities in applying these multi-sensing devices as a long-term stable personalised diagnostic tool for pharmacological screening and disease status.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bitziou, E.","O\u0027Hare, D.","Patel, B.A."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.300454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.268892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101346,"sim:weight":0.250469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47635,"sim:weight":0.250179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.241811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45651,"sim:weight":0.231017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.230276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.22898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.22249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.203651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45684,"sim:weight":0.203364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46011,"sim:weight":0.202743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.200858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.195144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.193925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77276,"sim:weight":0.190068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101347,"sim:weight":0.189223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.186832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.186314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.184057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Few hospitality and tourism studies, and those that focus on climate change, consider small firms\u0027 perspectives and thus this paper provides a voice to the sector. It explores whether small hotels are aware of climate change issues in their day-to-day operations, and how they are strategically responding to the change. The findings are framed by Lewin\u0027s (1951) three step theory, a cornerstone for understanding organisational change. The research findings, based on interviews with 11 small hotel owners and managers, indicate most of the hotels showed concern and some awareness about the impacts of climate change on tourism in Granada, but did not think the impacts would significantly affect their establishments. Some of the hotels were already employing environmental management strategies but felt that the local city council should act as a catalyst for further and co-ordinated action on climate change and provide support to the local small hotel sector. Local political inaction was seen as a major barrier to responding to climate change. The majority of hotels had difficulty relating to Lewin\u0027s model. Instead the results show managing change should be considered as a continuous process more than a set of distinct and discrete steps.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jarvis, N.","Pulido Ortega, A."],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9321256,"sim:weight":0.386489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Alternatively, empirical or simple methods based on linear elasticity can be used, but their limitations are significant. A calculation procedure is developed for retaining walls propped near the crest, with reference to Eurocode 7 (BS EN 1997-1:2004), which can be used to address safety and serviceability requirements in design and takes account of both the real nature of soil behaviour and the flexibility of the wall.  The results of the calculation are compared with those derived from a conventional limit equilibrium analysis and are used to develop look-up charts which can be used in design to take account of bending moment reduction due to wall flexibility effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Diakoumi, M.","Powrie, W."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2680700,"sim:weight":0.434031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101278,"sim:weight":0.407532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101614,"sim:weight":0.386505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269877,"sim:weight":0.28927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269982,"sim:weight":0.261586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101451,"sim:weight":0.239205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101390,"sim:weight":0.229771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99089,"sim:weight":0.219023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101592,"sim:weight":0.217611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103078,"sim:weight":0.216852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22948,"sim:weight":0.211714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386982,"sim:weight":0.20333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9019115,"sim:weight":0.199979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81450,"sim:weight":0.193674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46885,"sim:weight":0.189771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44550,"sim:weight":0.181868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387818,"sim:weight":0.180229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":261120,"sim:weight":0.179771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387172,"sim:weight":0.175589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271234,"sim:weight":0.173791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The article acknowledges that there may exist a difference between ‘saying and doing’ and also that the increase in attention directed at minority ethnic communities could be interpreted as political parties chasing votes. However, it is equally true that, by raising issues such as racism, political parties are contributing to much-needed integration efforts in Northern Ireland society. By stating their commitments to minority ethnic communities, political parties are making de facto promises, meaning that the language carries with it tacit understandings to realise certain goals.","bibo:AuthorList":["McGarry, Aidan","Hainsworth, Paul","Gilligan, Chris"],"dc:date":"2008-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This article starts from the observation that Roma constitute a sizeable minority group in Romania yet they remain under-represented in public life. Following a brief outline of how representation relates to legitimacy, the analysis proceeds in two steps: Firstly, the shared interests of Roma in Romania are determined; secondly, the role and purpose of the three organising structures of representation (elites, ethnic political parties, and civil society organizations) are assessed.

This paper focuses on Wii™ game play by older people in Sheltered Housing schemes, as part of an initiative to promote physical and social activity in these settings. Using participant observations, interviews and video analysis of sessions over a year we show how older people actively construct the sense of a meeting place as part of their Wii game play and the social processes that underlie this. Through the use of bounded regions and a sense of decorum older players create a „sacred space‟ around the Wii where they can learn new technical literacies, make new social connections with peers and take ownership of the communal spaces in which they live. We conclude with guidelines for encouraging appropriation and empowerment for older people through game play in communal housing settings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harley, David","Fitzpatrick, Geraldine","Axelrod, Lesley","White, Gareth","McAllister, Graham"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In this study we employed the culture independent TRACA system to isolate novel plasmids from the human gut microbiota, and a comparative metagenomic analysis to investigate the distribution and relative abundance of functions encoded by these plasmids in the human gut microbiome.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nNovel plasmids were acquired from the human gut microbiome, and homologous nucleotide sequences with high identity (\u003e90%) to two plasmids (pTRACA10 and pTRACA22) were identified in the multiple human gut microbiomes analysed here. However, no homologous nucleotide sequences to these plasmids were identified in the murine gut or environmental metagenomes. Functions encoded by the plasmids pTRACA10 and pTRACA22 were found to be more prevalent in the human gut microbiome when compared to microbial communities from other environments. Among the most prevalent functions identified was a putative RelBE toxin-antitoxin (TA) addiction module, and subsequent analysis revealed that this was most closely related to putative TA modules from gut associated bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes. A broad phylogenetic distribution of RelE toxin genes was observed in gut associated bacterial species (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria), but no RelE homologues were identified in gut associated archaeal species. We also provide indirect evidence for the horizontal transfer of these genes between bacterial species belonging to disparate phylogenetic divisions, namely Gram negative Proteobacteria and Gram positive species from the Firmicutes division.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nThe application of a culture independent system to capture novel plasmids from the human gut mobile metagenome, coupled with subsequent comparative metagenomic analysis, highlighted the unexpected prevalence of plasmid encoded functions in the gut microbial ecosystem. In particular the increased relative abundance and broad phylogenetic distribution was identified for a putative RelBE toxin/antitoxin addiction module, a putative phosphohydrolase/phosphoesterase, and an ORF of unknown function. Our analysis also indicates that some plasmids or plasmid families are present in the gut microbiomes of geographically isolated human hosts with a broad global distribution (America, Japan and Europe), and are potentially unique to the human gut microbiome. Further investigation of the plasmid population associated with the human gut is likely to provide important insights into the development, functioning and evolution of the human gut microbiota.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, B.V.","Sun, Funing","Marchesi, Julian R."],"dc:date":"2010-01-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2797193,"sim:weight":0.35066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631527,"sim:weight":0.350563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.317409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91534,"sim:weight":0.280646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45241,"sim:weight":0.269571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.262401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387289,"sim:weight":0.253816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77058,"sim:weight":0.25138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44537,"sim:weight":0.248354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222853,"sim:weight":0.244113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99353,"sim:weight":0.243478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229182,"sim:weight":0.24298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46554,"sim:weight":0.242523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.235901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":635563,"sim:weight":0.233397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75644,"sim:weight":0.233321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98866,"sim:weight":0.227995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778547,"sim:weight":0.226311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47352,"sim:weight":0.220799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768022,"sim:weight":0.21987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The project centres around a limited edition book work, which explores their shared interests in composition, notation, drawing, music and silence. Repetition and near–repetition, rotation and permutation are also of importance, as is accuracy and inaccuracy of the human hand, resulting in fluctuations in touch and pulse. The book contains a drawing and a score: The drawing consists of points of colour arranged in patterned formations, which is rotated throughout the book by means of screen print, each time with the points of colour in a different position. The score is shown with all performance indications, staves and stems removed leaving only the notes. The book incorporates performance scores and a DVD of 10 Chromatic Fields for piano; compositions consisting of 176 single notes. These are the 88 notes of a piano played once through and then repeated; the difference between each piece being the order of the notes. What remains is contour and reflection.\r\n\r\nAn exhibition of the book and related drawings took place at Art at Wharepuke Gallery, New Zealand in September 2012  The book was also exhibited at part of the Soundwaves Festival, University of Brighton and at the Friends Meeting House, which included a \u2028 promenade performance of Chromatic Fields 51 to 59.

As with other data visualization methods, such as graphs, bar charts, or pie charts, the automated generation of an Euler diagram from a suitable data set would be advantageous, removing the burden of manual data analysis and the subsequent task of drawing an appropriate diagram. Various methods have emerged that automatically draw Euler diagrams from abstract descriptions of them. One such method draws some, but not all, abstract descriptions using only circles. We extend that method so that more abstract descriptions can be drawn with circles, allowing sets to be represented by multiple curves.

Skin cancer and related illnesses are a major cause of disfigurement and death in New Zealand and Australia where the rates of Melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer, are four times higher than in the Northern Hemisphere regions of USA, UK and Canada (IARC, 1992). In 2007, AUT University (Auckland University of Technology) Fashion Department and the Health Promotion Department of Cancer Society - Auckland Division (CSA) developed a prototype hat aimed at exploring a barrier type solution to prevent facial and neck skin damage. This is a paradigm shift from the usual medical research model. This paper provides an overview of the project and examines how a fashion prototype has been used to communicate emergent social, environmental, personal, physiological and technological concerns to the trans-disciplinary research team. The authors consider how the design of a product can enhance and support sustainable design practice while contributing a potential solution to an ongoing health issue. Analysis of this case study provides an insight into prototyping in fashion and textiles design, user engagement and the importance of requirements analysis in relation to sustainable development. The analysis and a successful outcome of the final prototype have provided a gateway to future collaborative research and product development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farrer , Joan","Finn, Angela","Bartolo  , Paulo Jorge da Silva","Jorge, Mateus Artur,","Batista , Fernando da Conceicao,","Almeida, Henrique Amorim","Matias , Joao Manuel","Vasco, Joel Correia"],"dc:date":"2010-08-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It focuses on how the \u0027queer uncanny\u0027 may offer new ways of problematically posing notions of both ontological stability and normality, and furthermore, may work to disrupt definitions of gender and sexuality in relation to what constitutes the human. The article seeks to show how we may conceptualize the queer uncanny through its confrontation of a heteronormative category of the real. The article focuses in particular on anxieties about ontological boundaries and their relation to gender ambivalence in light of the contemporary theoretical writings of Judith Butler and Sue-Ellen Case. Then it moves to investigate the metaphor of \u0027the closet\u0027 as a materialization of heteronormative domination, as theorized by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, to consider its uncanny presence in the domestic space. Finally, through the notion of the uncanny, this article suggests we may also attempt a queer critical reading that, following Sue-Ellen Case\u0027s theoretical encouragement, works \u0027at the site of ontology\u0027 rather than in a gender and identity politics hinged on representation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jenzen, Olu"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108197,"sim:weight":0.357496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.333551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.3011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.299043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.29504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108355,"sim:weight":0.275157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86055,"sim:weight":0.270894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.268589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101523,"sim:weight":0.264267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.263831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710310,"sim:weight":0.241665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88616,"sim:weight":0.227032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710177,"sim:weight":0.19941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The idea of this\r\nexhibition is to explore the underlying connections between the different interpretations of the machine in relation to\r\narchitecture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sweeting, Ben","Aling, Michael","Ioannidou, Ersi","Foulsham, Tom","Longden-Thurgood, Glenn","Norman, Tim","Raleigh, Charlotte","Wihart, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Developing guidance and support for lecturers in higher education","bibo:abstract":"Writing and publishing are crucial to the development of a successful academic career. However, lecturers typically receive little guidance on this strand of their job. Any support that does exist tends to focus on the technical and practical aspects of scholarly writing. Advice is rarely provided on managing creative and emotional facets - factors that greatly contribute to writing quality and success. This article arises from a conversation between the authors: a Higher Education researcher and a Creative Writing lecturer at the same institution. The core of the article is a personal reflection by Author 2 on teaching Creative Writing to undergraduates. From this experience, we distil a model for supporting the writing of academic staff. We conclude that, whilst creative and academic writing enjoy their own styles and conventions, elements of the writing process are shared. We argue that Creative Writing lecturers hold valuable knowledge on the writing process, which is currently under-utilised in Higher Education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Antoniou, M.","Moriarty, J."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

While reading and writing for the purposes of research should be informative, insightful, rigorous and challenging, is it also possible to make these processes entertaining or even pleasurable?  Can the researcher give some personal insight into their world view and also from that of their interviewees instead of pretending that they play an entirely passive and objective role in the research process?  Many qualitative researchers (Grumet 1981; Cortazzi 1993; Charmaz 1995; Ely, Vinz et al. 1997; Erben 1998; Usher 1998; Denzin and Lincoln 1998, 2003; Ellis and Bochner 1998, 2003; Richardson 1998, 2003; Bruner 2004; Perselli 2004; Antoniou and Moriarty 2006; Short, Grant et al. 2007; Sparkes 2007; Caulley 2008; Trahar 2008) have started to push the academic writing borders and explore new ways to write up research.

Volunteers have mostly been ignored as a subject of research in almost all fields and there is a need for a deeper understanding of the diverse nature of sport event volunteer tourism. The study on 225 volunteers at the Championships investigated a range of 50 motivations framed by Pearce\u0027s (2005) Travel Career Pattern, as well as Snyder\u0027s (1993) Volunteer Function Inventory, Farell et al.\u0027s (1998) volunteer classification and Stebbins\u0027 (1992) work on serious and project-based leisure. Overall, the results indicated volunteer-based motivations that are generally more important than the tourism-based considerations. The age and gender of the volunteers had an influence on more of the volunteer-based motives compared with tourism. A considerable proportion of volunteers perceived themselves to be a tourist, and there was a desire to further take part in tourism activities, in addition to their volunteering duties, while at the event. Destination managers and volunteer event co-ordinators should be aware that the link to tourism may strategically help to increase commitment and experience satisfaction levels among the volunteers, who are less obvious and thus a potential tourism market.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jarvis, N.","Blank, C."],"dc:date":"2011-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The solvents include poly(ethylene glycol)s, poly(ethylene glycol) ethers, poly(ethylenimine) and glycerol-based substances. Solvent properties such as thermal stability, solubility of carbon dioxide and selectivity over nitrogen were investigated in a systematic study using a thermogravimetric analyser. Absorption results are reported for pure carbon dioxide and nitrogen as well as a mixture of both gases. Desorption and long-term sorption behaviour are also discussed. Glycerol and poly(ethylene glycol)s show a high solubility of carbon dioxide. Due to the high viscosity of the solvent, carbon dioxide absorption in poly(ethylenimine) is very slow in spite of the presence of favourable amine groups. PEG 300 was found to be the best solvent in this study and shows a high carbon dioxide solubility as well as good selectivity over nitrogen. The advantages of high stability, low solvent loss and low desorption energy of PEG 300 may outweigh its lower absorption capacity compared to the state-of-the-art solventmonoethanolamine, making it a potentially advantageous solvent for industrial carbon dioxide absorption processes.\r\nCopyright: RSC Publishing","bibo:AuthorList":["Ashenbrenner, O.","Styring, P."],"dc:date":"2010-07-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":363622,"sim:weight":0.179264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Whether changes in angiotensin IV activity underlie the cognitive effects of those cardiovascular drugs designed to disrupt the peripheral renin-angiotensin system in humans remains undetermined, but angiotensin IV appears to be a worthy candidate for consideration in drug development programmes. The mechanism of action of angiotensin IV is still debated, although its AT4 receptor has been convincingly identified as being insulin-regulated amino peptidase, which is also known as oxytocinase and placental leucine aminopeptidase. It is speculated that angiotensin IV may interact with insulin-regulated amino peptidase to enhance neuronal glucose uptake, prevent metabolism of other neuroactive peptides, induce changes in extracellular matrix molecules, or induce release of acetylcholine and/or dopamine. All of these things may be responsible for the beneficial effects on cognition, but none of them are yet proven. Importantly, strain differences in murine responses to angiotensin IV suggest that some individuals may benefit from drugs targeted to the AT4 receptor whilst others may be refractory. At present it thus appears that those individuals with the poorest baseline cognition may receive greatest benefit, but possible genetic differences in responses to angiotensin IV cannot be ruled-out.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gard, P.R."],"dc:date":"2008-12-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This functions to mark an ‘ingroup’ through its allegiance to core\r\nvalues and behaviours, from an ‘outgroup’, forged through a perceived ‘lack’ or rejection\r\nof those values and further, serves as a basis for the denigration of outgroups. However,\r\nrecent developments in mainstream social psychological theories of stereotype content\r\nhave developed a model of prejudicial intergroup relations as ambivalent, involving both\r\nnegative and positive content. In this paper we maintain an emphasis on the self-control\r\nethos but depart from an emphasis upon denigration to focus on a particular outgroup –\r\nthe fairtrade farmer/producer. We argue that developments in social representations\r\ntheory and mainstream social psychology can both contribute to a deeper understanding\r\nof this particular example of a cultural encounter apparently engendering social\r\nsolidarity. Recent social psychological models of stereotype content contribute an\r\nimportant emphasis upon ambivalence based on perceived structural relationships in the\r\nrepresentations of outgroups. However the self-control ethos allows an understanding of\r\nthe visual, symbolic and affective work involved in making solidarity with a ‘distant’\r\noutgroup a possibility.

One of the major beneficiaries of this will be those who use water for sport and recreation activities. It is certainly the case that some waters do contain – at some times – concentrations of pollutants sufficient to be a potential threat to public health but there is little robust evidence that water quality is a major constraint to many water-based activities. This paper addresses the current evidence deficit through a survey of recreational user representatives, exploring the cultural and political influences on decisions about when the quality of water is sufficient for their activity to take place. Using a reading of Bourdieu\u0027s ‘feel for the game’, the paper argues that there is a spectrum of involvement, contact and participation that conditions use and, thus, helps to establish an appropriate context for understanding the potential impacts on water-based recreation of the implementation of the WFD","bibo:AuthorList":["Ravenscroft, N.","Church, A."],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5076967,"sim:weight":0.499464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84615,"sim:weight":0.497415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84609,"sim:weight":0.486137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57147,"sim:weight":0.476159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5690423,"sim:weight":0.461946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58709,"sim:weight":0.440257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84697,"sim:weight":0.424448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60525,"sim:weight":0.412085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89869,"sim:weight":0.410634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382144,"sim:weight":0.406188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082421,"sim:weight":0.396617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84611,"sim:weight":0.387948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":381570,"sim:weight":0.384631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382146,"sim:weight":0.342297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382175,"sim:weight":0.299684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84647,"sim:weight":0.297542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84635,"sim:weight":0.282944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.280219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.278267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.278266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Temple Bar, St Paul’s,\r\nBelgravia and St James’s all attempted to court the same metropolitan\r\nmiddle-class family readership that Thackeray had enjoyed with his inclusion\r\nof apolitical and non-controversial articles, serialized novels, and poetry.\r\nThe editor of Temple Bar, George Augustus Sala — one of Dickens’s ‘Young\r\nMen’ — promised in the prospectus that his periodical would be ‘full of\r\nsolid yet entertaining matter, that shall be interesting to Englishmen and\r\nEnglishwomen . . . and that Filia-familias may read with as much gratification\r\nas Pater or Mater-familias’. But, paradoxically, Sala decided to surround\r\nhimself with a team of contributors hand-picked from his own bohemian\r\ncircle, London journalists whose political and social outlook were at odds\r\nwith those of a family readership. This article will argue that Sala, along\r\nwith sub-editor Edmund Yates and publisher John Maxwell, deliberately and\r\ncynically packed the first edition of Temple Bar with material designed to\r\nensnare a ‘respectable’ middle-class family readership. With selective anonymity\r\nand a serialized novel later described by Yates as ‘Trollope-and-milk’,\r\nalong with articles of a conservative and London-centric nature, 30,000\r\ncopies of the first edition were sold. Once this readership had been established,\r\nthe editorial team began to introduce content of a more liberal\r\nnature. Serialized sensation novels, such as Sala’s Seven Sons Of Mammon\r\nand Mary Braddon’s Aurora Floyd, attacked the dominance of the domestic\r\nrealist novel, while hard-hitting articles and poems alerted readers to the\r\nmisery and poverty to be found on the streets of London. Sala slowly\r\ncreated a periodical that, for a time at least, was the most unconventional\r\nof the shilling monthlies. This article will reveal the difficulties and subtleties\r\ninvolved in creating a brand personality for a monthly periodical, and by\r\ndoing so will highlight the complex relationships that existed between\r\nnineteenth-century London journalists.","bibo:AuthorList":["Blake, Peter"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2710192,"sim:weight":0.748775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.47304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108361,"sim:weight":0.469683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44896,"sim:weight":0.467478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382037,"sim:weight":0.458924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.452918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383589,"sim:weight":0.451194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77593,"sim:weight":0.438026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.436766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764209,"sim:weight":0.430847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44647,"sim:weight":0.424195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769036,"sim:weight":0.421557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112506,"sim:weight":0.416064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382085,"sim:weight":0.412065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81320,"sim:weight":0.410737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.410634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664600,"sim:weight":0.409873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46981,"sim:weight":0.409478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.403458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47160,"sim:weight":0.402734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This will include exposing the context of ‘mis-communication’ of sustainability issues in society by visual culture, the media and politics. The paper will argue that this has served to alienate, demoralise and disenfranchise many individuals and communities. Being rural does not necessarily mean being ‘green’ and the paper will describe the ‘green dichotomy’ and how rural behaviours are disproportionately dependent on natural resources and as a consequence are ‘less –sustainable’, despite relative autonomy and community potential to make significant gains. The paper will also unpack and explore how the loaded term sustainability only serves to divide and detract as a polemic and absolute term; whereas self-sufficiency is a demonstrable concern of vulnerable rural communities; a by-product of which can be genuine and valued, measurable and meaningful sustainable development. The paper will reference research and publish results of project field studies which explicate how ‘local’, introverted, self-serving and even ‘nimby’ concerns and agendas can indirectly drive sustainability / self-sufficiency.  \r\n\r\nThis all provides a contextual backdrop and rationale for the formation of a project that enables communities to frame their own concerns and envision themselves and their problems and responses as part of a larger system. The project forms around an experimental online content management system (CMS platform) that will facilitate sustainable development through envisioning, action planning and networking – connecting the ‘knots in the net’ of an active patchwork of ‘multi-local communities’. The platform design will provide methodology, process and capacity to enable reconciliation between the manifold concerns of social, economic and environmental sustainability whilst providing community facilitators with new opportunities and roles within the context of the changing technological and environmental landscape.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gant, Nick","Gittins, Teresa"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The objectives were to further the fundamental understanding of the processes involved in the initial stage of diesel spray formation, and the influence of viscosity, lubricity and surface tension. Tests were conducted at atmospheric conditions and on a rapid compression machine. \r\nAnalysis of the fuel sprays at the start of injection revealed jets for each fuel whose morphology was governed by their Reynolds and Weber numbers. As the fuel viscosity was one of the most varying properties this pro-duced jets that were dynamically different. The differences were also reflected in the injection timing of the fuel sprays where the friction between the fluid and the nozzle wall controlled the start of injection (SOI). Kerosene was found to advance the SOI when compared to the diesel and as such suspected to have an impact on the combustion phasing. The RME results fully corroborated with the conclusions drawn based on kerosene.\r\nDownstream from the nozzle the stabilising effect of viscosity can be seen to reduce the formation of surface waves, ligaments and droplets prior to the reaching the breakup length. It is speculated that the liquid core of the RME jet does not generally breakup directly into ligaments and droplets, but transitions into liquid sheets which then breakup or recombine into ligaments through surface tension.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shoba, Tenzin","Crua, Cyril","Heikal, M.R.","Gold, Martin"],"dc:date":"2011-09-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":337246,"sim:weight":0.311424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77006,"sim:weight":0.266956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.214811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.213423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76367,"sim:weight":0.201662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.201397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.19743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108986,"sim:weight":0.153063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":971642,"sim:weight":0.132199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Whether the existing element is a real building, or merely the outline of a project drawn on a screen or page, the container will usually provide the impetus for change. This type of process, and thus sensibility, is explained by Nicolas Bourriaud as a process where;\r\n\r\n‘It is no longer a matter of starting with a ‘blank slate’ or creating meaning on the basis of virgin material but of finding a means of insertion into the innumerable flows of production’. 1\r\n\r\nThis process of analysis and understanding promotes a certain kind of sensibility, an acceptance of what is already on or off-site, and the willingness to accentuate any of those found elements or narratives. This paper will propose that the importance of context and the process of analysing a given situation ensures that the act of creating interior space is inherently a strategy that is naturally transgressive. This means that the reworking of existing buildings, often thought to be the sole territory of restorers or conservationists, or even an adjunct of architectural practice, is actually the most radical and controversial of all spatial disciplines. The desire to re-order what already exists is inherently an act that interprets, conforms to, or even disobeys existing orders. Therefore designing new uses for existing buildings, occupying spaces that were once constructed for a particular previous purpose, provokes the designer into accepting or editing previous patterns of existence. \r\n\r\nThis paper will explore the notion that the act of ‘producing’ an interior is a result of the production of a certain kind of sensibility.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brooker, Graeme","Stone, Sally"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.305852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447568,"sim:weight":0.297178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387254,"sim:weight":0.288049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.287638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.275852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999521,"sim:weight":0.275551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99153,"sim:weight":0.272322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109122,"sim:weight":0.272193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.270335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183823,"sim:weight":0.269351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771698,"sim:weight":0.268635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.266157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.265379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48370,"sim:weight":0.263493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352169,"sim:weight":0.259672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051967,"sim:weight":0.257464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.256745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051960,"sim:weight":0.256108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145186,"sim:weight":0.255865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103044,"sim:weight":0.255582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although buildings have always been reused, the process of doing so has rarely been treated as an artform. In recent years, however, a huge amount of press coverage has been devoted to remodelling projects such as the Tate Modern in London, the Baltic Art Factory in Gateshead, the Grand Louvre pyramid and courtyard, and the Reichstag in Berlin, to name but a few. By attracting prestigious architects to its practice, it would appear that remodelling, once the dowdy cousin of the more glamorous architecture, has gained a new respectability. Re-readings responds to remodelling as an artform, making sense of the considerable structural, aesthetic, environmental, contextual and programmatic challenges of remodelling existing buildings.

Background: Ethnic minority groups often have to\r\nundertake many aspects of their day-to-day lives with limited English. The provision of\r\nhigh quality language interpretation services is vital for enabling access to public\r\nservices, including healthcare. The use of accredited or professional interpreters has\r\nbeen minimal within primary care and undermines the principle of equity in the\r\nNational Health Service. The local Primary Care Trust and ethnic minority forums\r\ninitiated this study. Methods: The overall research design was qualitative and data\r\ncollection was undertaken using focus groups. Twenty-four participants from the\r\nPakistani (Punjabi and Urdu speakers), Bangladeshi (Bengali speakers) and Chinese\r\n(Cantonese and Mandarin speakers) communities took part in one of five focus\r\ngroups. Ethnic minority members recruited participants, conducted the focus groups\r\nand translated the interviews after receiving in-depth training. Findings: Participants\r\nwere unaware that healthcare professionals could access interpreting provision for\r\ntheir primary health care consultations, which were usually managed with the assistance\r\nof family members (including children) and friends. Both the appropriateness of\r\nusing children and the potential compromising of confidentiality and privacy when\r\nusing friends to interpret were concerns.

It emphasises the ways in which the female celebrity autobiography is produced at increasingly early stages in the author’s fame, and how these precipitate memoirs are habitually structured as narratives of ‘female’ mental illnesses such as depression, self harm, and eating disorders. It argues that the genre is clearly gendered in that it is a product for, and a product of, of a popular culture that already trades on pathologizing, and thus devaluing, female celebrity. \r\n\r\nConsequently, the celebrity memoir of mental illness is a career move that effects a shift in the trajectory, pubic image, and, increasingly, the physical appearance of a previously ‘cheapened’ female celebrity. They (re-)construct an un-threateningly suffering persona - ‘somebody just like you’ - who articulates the experience of mental illness. This need to psychologically (re-)brand a female  celebrity can profitably replicate the telltale conventions of gossip media. It can also pre-empt and undermine the pathologized persona that the gossip media ‘expose’. \r\n\r\nThe paper explores typical examples of the genre that construct, perpetuate, and/or intervene in scandals about the author. Texts include Drew Barrymore’s Little Girl Lost, Geri Halliwell’s If Only, Gail Porter’s Laid Bare, Jade Goody’s My Autobiography, Daniella Westbrook’s The Other Side of Nowhere, and Kerry Katona’s Too Much, Too Young.  These memoirs do not explain psychological problems as consequences of the hedonistic excesses of fame, but as the urge for fame, the inability to deal with fame, and the failure to sustain a successful and publicly acceptable celebrity persona. In this way, they benefit from the popularity of the scandal  media, whilst substantiating the ideology that female celebrity is a process of ‘feminization’.  Thus the memoirs both react against, and reinforce, the pervasive pathologization of female celebrity in popular culture","bibo:AuthorList":["Bell, Emma"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69141,"sim:weight":0.570303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769015,"sim:weight":0.496359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47160,"sim:weight":0.254403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.211816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383543,"sim:weight":0.195771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45116,"sim:weight":0.190401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.185385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.177273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9039648,"sim:weight":0.173796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.173654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387009,"sim:weight":0.169593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352166,"sim:weight":0.168381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383352,"sim:weight":0.168242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48343,"sim:weight":0.167509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930364,"sim:weight":0.166616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.163883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.162736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.161622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43036,"sim:weight":0.159758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.158738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":1632311,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Imagine Madness: Madness, Revolution, Ressentiment and Critical Theory","bibo:abstract":"This paper focuses on a short passage by Nietzsche on the reciprocity between revolution and madness: ‘those men irresistibly drawn to throw off the yoke of any kind of morality and to frame new laws had, if they were not actually mad, no alternative but to make themselves or pretend to be mad’ (Daybreak, §I:14) The paper explores how from romanticism, through avant-gardism, to contemporary critical theory, some who sought to ‘make it new’ have willed madness as a means of liberation and revenge, sanctifying madness as a politically, aesthetically, and ontologically subversive way of being.\r\n\r\nNietzsche then asks: ‘do you understand why it had to be madness that did this?’, and ‘how can one make oneself mad when one is not mad?’ In response, the paper identifies the function that the words ‘madness’, ‘schizophrenia’ and ‘hysteria’ perform in the work of avant-gardists including Hugo Ball, Tristan Tzara, and Andrè Breton, and the radical theorists they influenced including Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Jean Baudrillard, and Helene Cixous. These thinkers equivalently imagine madness as the condition of existential and ontological authenticity that therefore precedes socialisation. If the perceived loss of self in mental illness is the negation of subjection and alienation, it promises a more devastating loss of the self - individual, innate, unified. So madness is the psychic precondition of social revolution: psychopathology as a politics.\r\n\r\nThe paper concludes that this will to madness is a certain leftist political moral urge equivalent to what Nietzsche called the angry melancholia of ressentiment - the moralistic attachment to suffering that spends its will to protest in (ironically) self-alienation and synthetic ‘ecstasies of delirium and mental suffering’. Ultimately, radically imagined madness is a captivatingly narcissistic image of subversion and radical difference that is made to reflect the revolutionary’s own ideals of existential authenticity, ingenuous creativity, and social revolution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bell, Emma"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18196,"sim:weight":0.377618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.337924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383927,"sim:weight":0.2237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47208,"sim:weight":0.222361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.220735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384798,"sim:weight":0.208479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780652,"sim:weight":0.206776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186292,"sim:weight":0.205012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.196762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45879,"sim:weight":0.196685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43493,"sim:weight":0.194323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383231,"sim:weight":0.191498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.191354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48342,"sim:weight":0.190632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.189135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352172,"sim:weight":0.187335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.186782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.185308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.181691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45027,"sim:weight":0.180193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":1632314,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"From Bad Girl to Mad Girl: British female celebrity, reality products, and the pathologization of pop-feminism","bibo:abstract":"This paper emphasises the ways in which the female celebrity autobiography is produced at increasingly early stages in the author’s fame, and how these precipitate memoirs are habitually structured as narratives of ‘female’ mental illnesses such as depression, self harm, and eating disorders. It argues that the genre is clearly gendered in that it is a product for, and a product of, of a popular culture that already trades on pathologizing, and thus devaluing, female celebrity. Tthe celebrity memoir of mental illness is a career move that effects a shift in the trajectory, pubic image, and, increasingly, the physical appearance of a previously ‘cheapened’ female celebrity. They (re-)construct an un-threateningly suffering persona - ‘somebody just like you’ - who articulates the experience of mental illness. This need to psychologically (re-)brand a female  celebrity can profitably replicate the telltale conventions of gossip media. It can also pre-empt and undermine the pathologized persona that the gossip media ‘expose’. \r\nThe paper focuses attention on the ways in which memoirs of mental ill health collude in a wider cultural backlash against 1990s pop feminist culture by exploring examples of the genre that construct, perpetuate, and/or intervene in scandals about the quasi-feminist rasgerssions of their authors. Texts include Geri Halliwell’s If Only, Gail Porter’s Laid Bare, Daniella Westbrook’s The Other Side of Nowhere, and Kerry Katona’s Too Much, Too Young.  The paper argues that these memoirs do not explain psychological problems as consequences of the hedonistic excesses of fame, but as the urge for fame, the inability to deal with fame, and the failure to sustain a successful and publicly acceptable celebrity persona. Thus the memoirs both react against, and reinforce, the pervasive pathologization of female celebrity in popular culture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bell, Emma"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69141,"sim:weight":0.526795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769015,"sim:weight":0.446288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383352,"sim:weight":0.237718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.210639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48296,"sim:weight":0.208887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352166,"sim:weight":0.208737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.205996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187501,"sim:weight":0.198717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187537,"sim:weight":0.196176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43663,"sim:weight":0.192215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.192106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.189451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45116,"sim:weight":0.187224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383660,"sim:weight":0.18619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.185366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.176766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.175442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48343,"sim:weight":0.174434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381940,"sim:weight":0.174354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225581,"sim:weight":0.173512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Children with the FTO (rs9939609) variant that increases the risk of obesity may have a higher susceptibility to the effects of DED because their internal appetite control system is compromised. We tested the relationship between DED and fat mass in early adolescence and its interaction with FTO variants.\r\n\r\nMethods and Findings\r\nWe carried out a prospective analysis on 2,275 children enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Diet was assessed at age 10 y using 3-day diet diaries. DED (kJ/g) was calculated excluding drinks. Children were genotyped for the FTO (rs9939609) variant. Fat mass was estimated at age 13 y using the Lunar Prodigy Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry scanner. There was no evidence of interaction between DED at age 10 y and the high risk A allele of the FTO gene in relation to fat mass at age 13 y (β \u003d 0.005, p \u003d 0.51), suggesting that the FTO gene has no effect on the relation between DED at 10 y and fat mass at 13 y. When DED at 10 y and the A allele of FTO were in the same model they were independently related to fat mass at 13 y. Each A allele of FTO was associated with 0.35±0.13 kg more fat mass at 13 y and each 1 kJ/g DED at 10 y was associated with 0.16±0.06 kg more fat mass at age 13 y, after controlling for misreporting of energy intake, gender, puberty, overweight status at 10 y, maternal education, TV watching, and physical activity.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThis study reveals the multi-factorial origin of obesity and indicates that although FTO may put some children at greater risk of obesity, encouraging a low dietary energy density may be an effective strategy to help all children avoid excessive fat gain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, L.","van Jaarsveld, C.H.M","Emmett, P.M.","Rogers, I.S.","Ness, A.R.","Hattersley, A.T.","Timpson, N.J.","Smith, J.D.","Jebb, S.A."],"dc:date":"2009-03-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1586869,"sim:weight":0.455459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387118,"sim:weight":0.436548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929822,"sim:weight":0.396166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75341,"sim:weight":0.390794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76297,"sim:weight":0.358411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75581,"sim:weight":0.340852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222949,"sim:weight":0.338556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43848,"sim:weight":0.338286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86101,"sim:weight":0.335848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.321646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222798,"sim:weight":0.320728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496751,"sim:weight":0.309377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26489,"sim:weight":0.308704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23821,"sim:weight":0.30835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.2924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145929,"sim:weight":0.291374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101488,"sim:weight":0.286674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85180,"sim:weight":0.273783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.271011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76455,"sim:weight":0.269502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

When Sala first visited America in 1863, as Special Correspondent for the Daily Telegraph during the Civil War, his articles were some of the most pro-slavery, pro-Southern and anti-Union pieces the English public had read. Sala attacked all aspects of Northern life, disputed the North’s reasons for war, criticised their treatment of free blacks and maintained that claims of barbarity towards slaves in the South had been grossly exaggerated. \r\nDespite his previous pronouncements, Sala returned to America for the Telegraph in 1879 and was greeted favourably wherever he went. He declared that he had been a ‘fool’ for supporting the wrong side during the Civil War but still maintained that African-Americans had been better off under the slave-system and that they were incapable of practising self-government. He observed that America was now ‘a wonderful country and a wonderful people.’\r\n\r\nAlthough hitherto neglected in scholarly debates on Anglo-American relations in the nineteenth century, this paper will highlight Sala’s importance in this context, not least because of the large readership he commanded. As a journalist for the newspaper with the largest daily circulation in the world, Sala’s fluctuating and controversial opinions on America were read by some 250,000 middle class English men and women every day.\r\n\r\nThis essay will also question to what extent Sala’s changing perceptions of America were influenced by the contemporary racial discourse of other middle-class commentators like Thomas Carlyle, Charles Dickens and Richard Burton, and by events like the Governor Eyre Affair. Using recent scholarship in the field of racial theory by critics including Catherine Hall, Robert Young and Tim Barringer, this paper will reassess English middle-class views on race, slavery and America during the second half of the nineteenth century.","bibo:AuthorList":["Blake, Peter"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2710192,"sim:weight":0.47553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47189,"sim:weight":0.306989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.296417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29199,"sim:weight":0.292079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.281321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199823,"sim:weight":0.276222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44678,"sim:weight":0.267691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.266839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.264464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44647,"sim:weight":0.258509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43413,"sim:weight":0.258422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382060,"sim:weight":0.256779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46981,"sim:weight":0.255116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112642,"sim:weight":0.253791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386874,"sim:weight":0.252037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112506,"sim:weight":0.248214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46587,"sim:weight":0.245627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768880,"sim:weight":0.245042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99382,"sim:weight":0.241794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48270,"sim:weight":0.239986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Mapping exercise - initial findings","bibo:abstract":"This report maps lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) equalities policies in the Hastings, Rother, ealden and East Sussex public sector. It examines trends in LGBT equality policies and equalities work in the public sector, and highlights areas for development. 10 public sector organisations took part. The results are reported under 3 broad headings:\r\nPolicy Requirements: The research found that while in general there is a good coverage of LGBT\r\nequalities from a policy perspective, key areas of concern included engagement with Public Sector\r\nEquality Duty C (the duty to foster good relations between LGBT people and non-LGBT people), levels of monitoring of LGBT service users, and appropriately using the data collected about both LGBT service users and staff members.\r\nPolicy Implementation: Staff training about LGBT equalities is widespread, but few organisations\r\nsaid that they had specific training about LGBT equalities. 4 of the public sector organisations said that they had networks or groups for LGBT staff, and those these tended to be well-supported by their parent organisations; however the absence of these should not be taken as an example of a lack of commitment to LGBT equalities. 5 organisations designated ‘staff champions’ for LGBT equality, who tended to occupy high-level positions in their respective organisations. While trans identities were dealt with specifically at the policy level, there was little evidence of policy engagement with specific sexual identities, such as lesbian, gay male and bi/bisexual. 7 of the public\r\nsector organisations did not address dual discrimination/multiple marginalisation and 2 noted specific problems in tackling this – however, there may also have been some confusion regarding terminology. 8 public sector organisations were producing LGBT-positive promotional materials targeted specifically at LGBT people, but only 4 were including LGBT-positive images or signage in their ‘mainstream’ promotional materials.\r\nLooking to the Future: No public sector services who responded to the research said that the public\r\nsector financial cuts would definitely affect LGBT equalities work, and 7 saying that they definitely would not.

All of the responding public sector organisations demonstrated that they would welcome assistance in improving LGBT equality.

They have\r\nbeen studied since the 1990s, when they were first proposed by Kent as a means of describing\r\nformal constraints within software models. Since that time, constraint diagrams have evolved in\r\na number of ways; a crucial refinement came with the recognition of the need to impose a reading order on the quantifiers represented by diagrammatic syntax. This resulted first in\r\naugmented constraint diagrams and, most recently, generalized constraint diagrams (GCDs), which\r\nare composed of one or more unitary diagrams in a connected graph. The design of GCDs includes several syntactic features that bring increased expressivity but which also make their metatheory more complex than is the case with preceding constraint diagram notations. In particular, GCDs are given a second order semantics.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this thesis we identify a decidable fragment of GCDs and provide the first set of sound inference rules for the system. We define a particular class of the unitary diagrams drawn from this fragment, which we call gamma-diagrams. We describe a decision procedure for the satisfiability of unitary gamma-diagrams, before developing a means of applying the decision\r\nprocedure to all unitary diagrams of the fragment, achieved by using the class of gamma-diagrams as a reduction class. Next, we develop a decision procedure for the\r\nnon-unitary diagrams of the fragment. This procedure makes use of several normal forms which\r\nenable us to judge the satisfiability of a (non-unitary) generalized diagram by examining the\r\nunitary diagrams it contains. We discuss the ways in which our work is of benefit to users of\r\nGCDs and those engaged in making software tools based on them. Finally, we identify the ways in\r\nwhich our results provide the foundations for further theoretical study of the system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burton, J."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103714,"sim:weight":0.672932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222751,"sim:weight":0.317271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386661,"sim:weight":0.226428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.225767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101552,"sim:weight":0.209776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106942,"sim:weight":0.201599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999162,"sim:weight":0.199499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5861,"sim:weight":0.197625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387124,"sim:weight":0.196226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386777,"sim:weight":0.180442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826866,"sim:weight":0.169048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.157251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7537,"sim:weight":0.137006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932553,"sim:weight":0.115353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":971643,"sim:weight":0.0905781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At the same time it risks creating a greater digital divide and further exclusion. How we approach design for this new generation will determine whether or not the third wave will provide positive advances towards an inclusive digital world. We therefore need to put forward both a rationale for inclusive design and provide pointers towards technical development and design practice in support of inclusion. It is our belief that there is not only a strong moral case for design for inclusion but also significant commercial incentive, which may be key to persuading influential players to focus on inclusion.

However the industry is changing, due to devaluation of design on the one hand and economic pressure and re-evaluation of design ethics coupled with consumer integrity on the other. This paper addresses the emerging retail landscape, where production and consumption practices are separating like oil and water. We are witnessing a paradigm shift with regard to business models, where the new consumer desires and is demanding high value, performance and smart ethical fashion. These consumers expect co-creation, innovation, opportunities through customisation, supply chain transparency and business integrity, to build an ongoing relationship with a retailers ‘no worry’ brand. They are generation ‘C’, who often purchase from virtual retail environments, and who understand the relevance of design for behavioural change, and the true cost of products both in material and human terms. Sustainability, or people, profit, planet, inherent in the bedrock of a cradle-to-cradle fashion textiles system of the near future. \r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, fashion is worth 326 million NZD in exports (NZTE, 2008) and as elsewhere the insatiability of the mainstream fashion consumer is being satisfied by an escalation of ‘pile it high, sell it cheap’ outlets. Here the ‘dollar a day’ dress (Marks, 2005) made by a significant silent workforce of slave labourers, refugees, illegal workers and children exist in the black manufacturing economy, even here in the back streets of Auckland (Cumming, 2002). Consumer responses during the recent recession (Euromonitor, 2010; Vass, 2009) are poles apart, customers buying wisely what is needed, with integrity, in contrast to the pressure of ‘buy one, get one free’ and the frenzy of a fashion bargain. With these attitudes working in tandem, this paper predicts an unsustainable global manufacturing fashion/textile industry will continue to run parallel to an emerging model of fashion/textiles design and business systems. \r\n\r\nFashion textile literature and theory relating to sustainability is often emotive, fragmented and vague. This positioning paper argues that a polarisation, or separation, of the producer, consumer, disposal and reuse markets is already taking place in the best and the worst of the industry, on every high street and mall. To illustrate this division we have focused on two fictitious adjacent clothing stores in the high street of 2018: we predict a continuation of the unsustainable global manufacturing fashion textile industry as Shop Two; running in parallel to an emerging new paradigm of fashion and textiles found in Shop One. \r\n\r\nThis thesis has been developed by focussing on issues of sustainability, comparing existing fashion/textile retail supply and disposal chains and analysis of the cause-and-effect, using guiding principles from cradle-to-grave analysis and systemic reasoning. It is underpinned by, and reflects upon the knowledge of current local and global fashion/textile design business practice and data which forms the context for thinking through design to enable change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farrer, Joan","Fraser, Kim"],"dc:date":"2011-11-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.4121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.37606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.365407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.361408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.353103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.35304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.349342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Exploration drilling has found mineralised intercepts including 43 m of 0.83% Cu and 0.05 g/t Au and 40.4 m of 1.41% Cu and 0.33 g/t Au, and the extent of mineralisation is currently still open. The host rocks to the deposit consist of strongly altered conglomerate and trachyandesitic lavas interbedded with thin marble bands and possible beds of pelitic sediment. These are cut by a northeast-trending shear zone which either hosts the ore bodies, or\r\nwith which the ore bodies are spatially associated, and which is affected by extensive carbonate metasomatism. The ore bodies themselves consist of chalcopyrite-pyrite mineralised magnetite breccias, which grade laterally into magnetitelithic breccias and lithic breccias, with the clasts mainly derived from the volcanic rocks. Alteration consists of early albitisation associated with actinolite and magnetite, overprinted by sodic-potassic (biotite-scapolite) and potassic (biotite-K feldspar) and finally propylitic (hematite-epidote-muscovite-chlorite-calcite) alteration. Sulphide mineralisation\r\nis associated with the propylitic stage. Both textural and chemical constraints indicate sulphide mineralisation post-dates brecciation and magnetite mineralisation. Preliminary mineralogical constraints indicate early alteration from 500 to 600°C, and chloritisation/carbonatisation from 250 to 350°C. Portions of the deposit underwent intense weathering resulting in the formation of native copper in places. Geochronological constraints (Re-Os molybdenite, U-Pb titanite and allanite) indicate sulphide mineralisation took place at around 1860 to 1850 Ma, with some LA-ICPMS analyses of allanite suggesting initial mineralisation at around 1890 to 1880 Ma, and Pb-loss from titanite via metamorphism at ~1800 Ma. The origin of fl uids responsible for Fe mineralisation is currently poorly constrained, but C and O isotope analyses of calcite are consistent with a magmatic or magmatic equilibrated origin for copper-stage fluids.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, M.P.","Coppard, J.","Herrington, R.","Porter, T.M."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1632356,"sim:weight":0.630687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8152,"sim:weight":0.568493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":722799,"sim:weight":0.493762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54648,"sim:weight":0.469988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734391,"sim:weight":0.423121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85004,"sim:weight":0.416135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62701,"sim:weight":0.410644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54497,"sim:weight":0.394033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62711,"sim:weight":0.386157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57191,"sim:weight":0.374699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29473,"sim:weight":0.363046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1480123,"sim:weight":0.335128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27269,"sim:weight":0.334373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43826,"sim:weight":0.322386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54489,"sim:weight":0.316858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29431,"sim:weight":0.309509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":722815,"sim:weight":0.300981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3151,"sim:weight":0.300941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43808,"sim:weight":0.296065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108605,"sim:weight":0.283962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Valerianovskoe arc is the possible westward extension to the South Tien Shan arc that is host to the giant Almalyk Cu-Au porphyry system in Uzbekistan. The magnetite bodies of the Turgai belt replace limestone and tuffs, and are distal to locally proximal to the contacts of gabbro-diorite-granodiorite intrusive complexes. Three main stages of alteration and mineralisation can be recognised at these deposits, namely: (1) pre-ore; (2) the main magnetite forming; and (3) post ore phases. The pre-ore stage is characterised by high temperature, metamorphic/metasomatic calc- and alumino-silicates. The main magnetite ore phase formed when hot, sulphur poor, acidic, iron-, silica- and aluminium rich fluids were structurally focused to dissolve and replace the dominantly limestone hosts. This was accompanied by a skarn assemblage gangue of epidote, calcic-pyroxenes, calcic-garnet and calcic-amphiboles, minor sulphide minerals and high field strength element (HFSE)-bearing accessory minerals such as titanite and apatite. This magnetite-skarn\r\nmineralisation was followed by a late sulphide phase, when comparatively cooler fluids, which produced distinctive and extensive alteration assemblages of sodium-rich scapolite, albite, chlorite and K feldspar, accompanied by chalcopyrite, pyrite and minor sphelarite and galena. The post-ore phase, is characterised by cross cutting barren veins composed of calcite, lesser albite and K feldspar, and minor quartz, and by widespread alteration comprising scapolite, albite and silica, which surrounds the deposit, and extends for several kilometers into the host rock. Many of the geological and mineralogical features of these deposits closely resemble those of IOCG deposits and provinces around the world.\r\nHowever, as the copper sulphide mineralisation is sub-economic, they may only be classified as either IOCG-style or IOCG-related deposits. Stable isotope (C, O, S) studies have been carried out on a range of sulphides, carbonates and silicates related to the mineralisation. Preliminary results from sulphides intergrown with magnetite support a magmatic source for the sulphur. Oxygen isotope data from associated silicates and iron oxides also support an igneous, or igneous rock equilibrated source for the mineralising fl uids. Carbon and oxygen isotope data from gangue carbonates suggest\r\ncarbonate is derived from the interaction of igneous-derived or igneous-equilibrated fl uids with host limestones.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hawkins, T.","Herrington, R.","Smith, M.P.","Maslenikov, V.","Boyce, A.","Porter, T.M."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1632355,"sim:weight":0.630687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":722799,"sim:weight":0.515469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54648,"sim:weight":0.433703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5845736,"sim:weight":0.423705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62701,"sim:weight":0.414739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29473,"sim:weight":0.395555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62711,"sim:weight":0.393718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27269,"sim:weight":0.377145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54507,"sim:weight":0.376478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8152,"sim:weight":0.373616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54497,"sim:weight":0.370087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85004,"sim:weight":0.338158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57191,"sim:weight":0.319684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54489,"sim:weight":0.315585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29431,"sim:weight":0.296696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":600410,"sim:weight":0.290812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":722815,"sim:weight":0.288405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55151,"sim:weight":0.288373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":981845,"sim:weight":0.284912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":379635,"sim:weight":0.279515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The production was cleverly described as ‘recitative musick’ allowing it to be performed at D’Avenant’s private residence in Rutland House, London at a time when Oliver Cromwell’s puritan government forbade theatre productions – yet did not specifically forbid music.  The work is ostensibly the first performed English Opera. Cunningham’s film draws upon fragments of music by Lawes and Locke and reconstructs the setting of a typical 17th century painting in which musicians are presented in domestic settings. \r\n\r\n\r\nInvisible Targets by Conall Gleeson responds to the notions of civil conflict, democracy and monarchy which are raised throughout the exhibition. The work, written for loudspeaker and two snare drums, features a rhythmic fragment of the command to ‘retreat‘  which would have been played on a snare drum in the 17th century battlefield. The sounds of twentieth century modes of military communication such as morse code and radio are introduced but filtered through the rattle of snare drums placed directly infront of the loudspeakers. Toward the end of the work the muffled voice of Prince Harry is heard talking about his experiences in Afghanistan and in so doing a direct line between the political climate of today and that of Prince Harry’s distant ancester Charles 1st are drawn.\r\n\r\nCromwell’s Sorrow by Jean Martin places in situ the music of 17th century English composer Henry Purcell and an imagined soundscape of battlecries and social unrest that pervaded the streets of London during the period of the English civil war. \r\n\r\nThe site specific performance by Mikhail Karikis, Between Two Mouths: A Guided Tour challenges the representation of war and the narrative formalisation of history.

This problem is linked to the question of the balance of semantics and pragmatics in the analysis of modality: theories which treat modals as monosemous tend to give them a skeletal semantics and make pragmatics and the context do more of the work of interpretation. We argue that modals are not uniform but that the interpretation of different modals varies in the way context applies to them: more specifically we argue that senses of \u0027may\u0027 are clearly distinct, and that this distinction can be accounted for on the basis of different types of pragmatic processes that take place in deriving those senses, not only \u0027saturation\u0027 as is the case with Papafragou\u0027s (2000) model, but also pragmatic processes of the \u0027optional\u0027 variety, such as \u0027modulation\u0027, in the sense of Recanati (2004). For \u0027can\u0027, we argue that the senses are less distinct from each other than is the case with \u0027may\u0027, and that different types of pragmatic processes of the \u0027optional\u0027 variety are at play with this modal. Therefore, \u0027may\u0027 [and \u0027must\u0027] are more polysemous in nature rather than \u0027can\u0027 [and \u0027should\u0027].","bibo:AuthorList":["Timotijevic, Jelena","Jenset, Gard","Heggelund, Oystein","Dyvik Cardona, Margrete","Wold, Stephanie","Didriksen, Anders"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Theorizing property as\r\nintrinsically political demands a return to Marx but on terms he may not have recognized. I\r\noutline a politics of property in this paper contending that there can be no universal\r\njustification for any regime of property. Property is by definition the institution of a wrong.\r\nThe articulation of something as property establishes a border, determining what can be\r\nowned, how far ownership extends, where it is limited, as well as terms of use and terms of\r\nabuse. It establishes a set of property relations, and defines a vocabulary of the proper. Here\r\nsovereign state power is enlisted to enforce relations of property beneficial to some, but not\r\nall. A challenge to any political regime must of necessity put in to question both the forms of\r\nproper behaviour, and the regime of property. These are intrinsically related to each other. I\r\nconclude by arguing that democracy is always improper. Property, in all of its forms entails\r\nenclosure. Enclosure requires the drawing and the maintenance of boundaries of exclusion\r\nand inclusion. The sovereign determination of the proper, as well as of the exception to the\r\nproper defines trespass. Trespass is a form of democratic enactment when, and if, it\r\ndestabilises enclosure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Devenney, Mark"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In this practice drawing (and printmaking as an extension of drawing) is reduced to the fundamental activity of making one mark after another, in both intuitive and predetermined sequences. In recent drawings colour is activated by a concentrated series of dots (almost like pixels in a digitised image) of colour pencil. When viewed from a distance, they dissolve, producing a fluctuating surface of indeterminate colour. \r\nThis commentary focuses on a collaborative project between Bullen and the composer Jamie Crofts, which centres on a limited edition book-work which seeks to assimilate different disciplines, in this case, drawing, music and print media, as a means to examine aural and visual liminality. The project investigates the relationship between composition, notation, drawing, music and silence, as well as the importance of accuracy and inaccuracy of the human hand, resulting in fluctuations in touch and pulse.  A shared interest in repetition and near – repetition allows for the possibility of variable permutation of small units, in which the interactive act of opening and turning pages adds a sequential and temporal dimension. The book incorporates screen-printed score, image, and contains a CD of mp3s and data.\r\nThe paper will also discuss the nature of a collaborative practice between artist and composer, and artist/composer and printer/designer. It also addresses a concern to positioni print as an extension of drawing, and as a means of extending its field through the vehicle of the artist’s book and collaborative practice. Bullen’s reductive abstraction invites a slowing down of visual perception and the attentive nature of compositional processes connect to ideas of contemplative practice that run counter to a society fixated by speed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bullen, Duncan"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

An illusion of economic growth has been based on increasing levels of often traumatic personal debt and a low-wage labor force compelled\r\ninto increasingly problematic practices of employment. In recent years, a concerted neoliberal assault on subjectivity, modes of employment, minimum incomes, and practices of welfare governance has effectively constituted new\r\nforms of poverty and personal sustenance through deregulated sub-prime credit markets. The variable and multifunctional nature of personal debt has provided a substrate for neoliberal public policy by systematically reinforcing\r\nthe development of a low-wage labor market and by representing a means through which to transfer collective risk into private responsibility.

This computation allows for the variation in heat capacity of the constituents and solves the equilibrium combustion equation for the 10 major species: N2, O2, H2, CO, CO2, H2O, O, H, NO, and OH. A constant-volume spherical vessel has been used for measuring burning rates for liquid fuels at elevated initial temperatures and pressures. A heating system and a mixing system were installed for measurements at elevated initial temperatures and for preparing mixtures of liquid fuels. The test facility has been used for generating reproducible data for both gaseous and liquid fuels. Using the multizone model, the laminar burning velocity has been found for mixtures of methanol–air with initial temperatures of 293.15 and 425 K, initial pressures of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.5 bar, and equivalence ratios of 0.8 to 1.6. The laminar burning velocities were fitted to a seven-term equation to describe the effects of stoichiometry, pressure, and temperature. The burning velocities for methanol–air have been compared with earlier measurements; the values obtained from the present study give very good agreement with the recently reported data of Davis and Law for ambient pressure and temperature. Cellular flames were found to exist in some test runs and the conditions of its onset are reported.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saeed, Khizer","Stone, C.R."],"dc:date":"2004-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":882503,"sim:weight":0.604604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It was necessary to have an informed view of the IT skills level  of all academic teaching staff. A selfassessment questionnaire was designed based on the core competencies in the European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL). The results were used to offer a targeted pilot of a new online learning training method. Results showed considerable diversity in the range of IT skills. Over half (55%) of the staff could not use a range of IT software at a prescribed benchmark level.   Staff were more likely to be skilled at word-processing and Internet tasks (average score above the benchmark) and less likely to be competent with presentations,  spreadsheets and databases (average score below the benchmark). Staff working in science-based subjects tended to score higher. As a result of the survey, some staff were offered an online basic skills training programme. Staff liked the flexibility   of this, but also found that they needed personal support and encouragement. It is necessary to raise the profile of IT skills and to argue for their relevance. A  range of training opportunities is needed that will assist the needs and motivations of staff. Staff prefer training that they see as relevant to their subject area and professional context. Online software skills training does not provide a single solution, but can add an additional method that will appeal to some learners.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haynes, P.","Ip, K.","Saintas, P.","Stanier, S.","Palmer, H.","Thomas, N.","Reast, G.","Barlow, J.","Maillardet, F.J."],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

An analysis of news headlines and texts demonstrates the use of mythical language and imagery in this case (as in  other high-profile cases) as compared with the usual reporting of homicides in the press. Notions of innocence and guilt are explored through the construction of gendered and raced bodies in the case study. The article finds that this media discourse relies for its impact on the simultaneous and mutually dependent  construction of fabular gendered and raced ideas; of exceptional innocence and purity (unusually) attached to black femininity (beauty) and of exceptional   and volatile violence (usually) attached to black masculinity (the beast). Moreover, the discourse is constructed such that guilt for the gun crime extends  beyond the individual perpetrators to the black community as a whole. While media coverage reflects a realistic fear of gun crime, the article concludes that media  discourse in this case directs fear towards the black community/male as the dangerous \u0027other\u0027, and that this is crucially underpinned by polarized gendered discourse.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilcox, Paula"],"dc:date":"2005-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77022,"sim:weight":0.504084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75773,"sim:weight":0.475891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.455977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.390819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.390819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.386156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.383452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108988,"sim:weight":0.375158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.362251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.354196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.315586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To date, sociological research reflecting first‐year students’ perceptions of the processes involved in developing social lives at university is scarce. Here the concept of ‘social support’ is used to analyse interviews with 34 first‐year students, investigating the processes through which social integration (or lack of it) influenced their decision as to whether or not to leave university. Our data support the claim that making compatible friends is essential to retention, and that students’ living arrangements are central to this process. Such friends provide direct emotional support, equivalent to family relationships, as well as buffering support in stressful situations.

Art therapy and activity groups had up to eight members and lasted for 90 minutes. In art therapy, members were given access to a range of art materials and encouraged to use these to express themselves freely. Members of activity groups were offered various activities that did not involve use of art or craft materials and were encouraged to collectively select those they wanted to pursue.\r\nMain outcome measures: The primary outcomes were global functioning, measured using the global assessment of functioning scale, and mental health systems, measured using the positive and negative syndrome scale, 24 months after randomisation.

Suppose the sensors transmit this information to the cloud , continuously and unobtrusively. Suppose artificial intelligence in the cloud detects an anomaly. Suppose it tells your doctor: sighs of relief all round. But then suppose it tells an actuary, who tells your insurer, who tells your employer ... This is the world of pervasive adaptation. This Pervasive Day explores the potential and perils of daily living with pervasive adaptive computing. This is the result of saturating ourselves and our physical environment with sensors, cameras and devices, all connected to and inter-connected by global networks and computers, which can run increasingly intelligent machine-learning and data fusion algorithms on datasets that could be generated by the entire human population. This book takes as its unifying theme Ira Levin\u0027s 1970 science fiction novel This Perfect Day to expose both potential innovations and controversial social issues. It explores the science and technology of pervasive adaptation through a human-centred and socio-technical perspective within the cultural, ethical and legal context of contemporary life. It discusses how pervasive adaptation could provide the foundations for a new range of life-enhancing and planet-saving applications in health, sustainability and assistive living. On the other hand, with the recording, storage and processing of every action, emotion and thought, there also arise the possibilities for unwarranted surveillance, invasions of privacy, loss of civil liberties and commercial exploitation. This Pervasive Day is an insightful read for anyone concerned with the social impact of technology. Written by experienced technologists with a deep interest in computational intelligence, human-computer interaction and ambient systems, This Pervasive Day is a remarkable single source of reference a fusion of several technical disciplines that makes for a broad scope of investigation within the domains of pervasive computing. Unifying, informative and thought-provoking, This Pervasive Day takes its place as a landmark title that will challenge the perceptions of the technologists and policy-makers, the pragmatists and the theorists, the doers and the thought-leaders.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farrer, J","Baurley, S","Ferscha, A","Michael, K","Millan, J","Mitcheson, P","Patten, D","Polak, P","Ryan, R","Sasse, A","Schlachter, F","Serbedzijia, N","Vasalou, M","Whitaker, R","Pitt, Jeremy"],"dc:date":"2012-06-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":59347,"sim:weight":0.229923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.216042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.208492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.208007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151793,"sim:weight":0.207457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447898,"sim:weight":0.206351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.206341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44768,"sim:weight":0.205984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70404,"sim:weight":0.203894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.200476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880707,"sim:weight":0.19956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.199481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.19847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.197793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.197011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.194093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.193495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193234,"sim:weight":0.192868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.191529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.189852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However the industry is changing, due to devaluation of design on the one hand and economic pressure and re-evaluation of design ethics coupled with consumer integrity on the other. This paper addresses the emerging retail landscape, where production and consumption practices are separating like oil and water. We are witnessing a paradigm shift with regard to business models, where the new consumer desires and is demanding high value, performance and smart ethical fashion. These consumers expect co-creation, innovation, opportunities through customisation, supply chain transparency and business integrity, to build an ongoing relationship with a retailers ‘no worry’ brand. They are generation ‘C’, who often purchase from virtual retail environments, and who understand the relevance of design for behavioural change, and the true cost of products both in material and human terms. Sustainability, or people, profit, planet, inherent in the bedrock of a cradle-to-cradle fashion textiles system of the near future. \r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, fashion is worth 326 million NZD in exports (NZTE, 2008) and as elsewhere the insatiability of the mainstream fashion consumer is being satisfied by an escalation of ‘pile it high, sell it cheap’ outlets. Here the ‘dollar a day’ dress (Marks, 2005) made by a significant silent workforce of slave labourers, refugees, illegal workers and children exist in the black manufacturing economy, even here in the back streets of Auckland (Cumming, 2002). Consumer responses during the recent recession (Euromonitor, 2010; Vass, 2009) are poles apart, customers buying wisely what is needed, with integrity, in contrast to the pressure of ‘buy one, get one free’ and the frenzy of a fashion bargain. With these attitudes working in tandem, this paper predicts an unsustainable global manufacturing fashion/textile industry will continue to run parallel to an emerging model of fashion/textiles design and business systems. \r\n\r\nFashion textile literature and theory relating to sustainability is often emotive, fragmented and vague. This positioning paper argues that a polarisation, or separation, of the producer, consumer, disposal and reuse markets is already taking place in the best and the worst of the industry, on every high street and mall. To illustrate this division we have focused on two fictitious adjacent clothing stores in the high street of 2018: we predict a continuation of the unsustainable global manufacturing fashion textile industry as Shop Two; running in parallel to an emerging new paradigm of fashion and textiles found in Shop One. \r\n\r\nThis thesis has been developed by focussing on issues of sustainability, comparing existing fashion/textile retail supply and disposal chains and analysis of the cause-and-effect, using guiding principles from cradle-to-grave analysis and systemic reasoning. It is underpinned by, and reflects upon the knowledge of current local and global fashion/textile design business practice and data which forms the context for thinking through design to enable change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farrer, Joan","Fraser, Kim"],"dc:date":"2011-11-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

One distinct advantage of this fast developing technique is the ability to compute trajectories of discrete particles. This provides the opportunity to evaluate the interactions between particle, fluid and boundary at the microscopic level using local gas parameters and properties, which is difficult to achieve using a continuum model. To date, most of these applications focus on the flow behaviour. This paper provides an overview of the application of DEM in gas–solids flow systems and discusses further development of this technique in the application of drying particulate solids. A number of sub-models, including momentum, energy and mass transfer, have been evaluated to describe the various transport phenomena.

Local-authority-owned provision universally declined in this period, but changes in private residential and nursing homes were far more varied. Some parts of Britain experienced a growth in this market, in particular Scotland. Regions which were traditionally linked with greater numbers of retired people in their populations declined in their private residential home markets (e.g. the South West and South East). Wales experienced a regional decline that was greater than most English regions. Using additional Department of Health data, it was possible to estimate which local authority areas in England were exporting state-funded supported residents to homes out of their area. Most of these authorities were in urban areas and the highest rates of exporting were from Inner London boroughs. Political control and average property prices were explored as possible independent variables influencing the percentage rate of decline in homes in a local authority area. It appeared that Conservative authorities experienced a more rapid decline in government-owned homes than those run by Labour, but the results were not statistically significant, suggesting that local politics was a not a key influence on the trend. Average property prices did not affect all areas of the country, but were found to have a negative and significant association with percentage rates of decline in care homes in both Wales and London.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haynes, P.","Balloch, Susan","Banks, Laura","Hill, Michael"],"dc:date":"2006-11-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108145,"sim:weight":0.376647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30523,"sim:weight":0.352061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.322356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.316626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.316626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108754,"sim:weight":0.290359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

My starting point is the observation that the ‘meanings’ associated with words are protean in nature. That is, the semantic values associated with words are flexible, open-ended and highly dependent on the utterance context in which they are embedded. In attempting to provide an account of meaning-construction that coheres with this observation, I develop a cognitively realistic theory of lexical representation and a programmatic theory of lexical concept integration. My fundamental claim is that there is a basic distinction between lexical concepts and meaning. While lexical concepts constitute the semantic units conventionally associated with linguistic forms, and form an integral part of a language user’s individual mental grammar, meaning is a property of situated usage-events, rather than words. That is, meaning is not a function of language per se, but arises from language use. I present an account of lexical concepts and the conceptual knowledge structure, cognitive models, with respect to which they are relativised. I also situate this theory within a usage-based account. I then develop a theory of lexical concept integration which serves to provide an account of how lexical concepts are combined in service of situated meaning-construction. As the construct’s lexical concept and cognitive model are central to the theory of lexical representation and meaning-construction I present, I refer to the approach developed here as the Theory of Lexical Concepts and Cognitive Models, or LCCM Theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Evans, Vyvyan"],"dc:date":"2006-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Estimating overall risk\r\nacross a range of putative risk factors is fundamental to prevention of depression. However, we lack reliable and valid methods of risk estimation. This protocol paper introduces PREDICT, an international research study to address this risk estimation.\r\nMethods/design: This is a prospective study in which consecutive general practice attendees in\r\nsix European countries are recruited and followed up after six and 12 months. Prevalence of\r\ndepression is assessed at baseline and each follow-up point. Consecutive attendees between April 2003 and September 2004 who were aged 18 to 75 were asked to take part. The possibility of a\r\ndepressive episode was assessed using the Depression Section of the Composite International\r\nDiagnostic Interview. A selection of presumed risk factors was based on our previous work and a\r\nsystematic review of the literature. It was necessary to evaluate the test-retest reliability of a number of risk factor questions that were developed specifically, or adapted, for the PREDICT study. In a separate reliability study conducted between January and November 2003, consecutive general practice attendees in the six participating European countries completed the risk factor items on two occasions, two weeks apart. The overall response rate at entry to the study was 69 per cent.\r\nWe exceeded our expected recruitment rate, achieving a total of 10,048 people in all. Reliability coefficients were generally good to excellent.\r\nDiscussion: Response rate to follow-up in all countries was uniformly high, which suggests that\r\nprediction will be based on almost a full cohort. The results of our reliability analysis are\r\nencouraging and suggest that data collected during the course of PREDICT will have a satisfactory level of stability. The development of a multi-factor risk score for depression will lay the foundation for future research on risk reduction in primary care. Our data will also provide the necessary evidence base on which to develop and evaluate interventions to reduce the prevalence of depression.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walker, Carl","King, Michael","Nazareth, Irwin","Weich, Scott","Torres-Gonzalez, Francisco","Svab, Igor","Maaroos, Heidi-Ingrid","Neeleman, Jan","Xavier, Miguel","Morris, Richard","Bellon-Saameno, Juan A","Moveno-Kustner, Berta","Rotar, Danica","Rifel, Janez","Alouja, Anu","Kalda, Ruth","Geerlings, Mirjam I","Caracca, Idalmiro","Caldas de Almeida, Manuel","Vicente, Benjamin","Saldivia, Sandra","Rioseco, Pedro"],"dc:date":"2006-01-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.482133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.441892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.436031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.420682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.419256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.406624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384639,"sim:weight":0.394558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is based on the investigation of droplet trajectories in the frame of reference moving with the phase velocity of the wave. Although the equations involved are relatively simple, the analysis shows distinctive characteristics of grouping and non-grouping cases. In the case of grouping, droplet trajectories converge to the points for which the ratio of flow velocity in this frame of reference and the amplitude of flow oscillations is less than 1, and the cosine of this ratio is positive. In the case of non-grouping, droplet trajectories in this frame of reference oscillate around the translational velocity close to the velocity of flow in the same frame of reference. The effect of the droplet size on the grouping pattern is investigated. It has been pointed out that for the smaller droplets much more stable grouping is observed. The effect of droplet evaporation is studied in the limiting case when the contribution of the heat-up period can be ignored. It is shown that evaporation can lead to droplet grouping even in the case when the non-evaporating droplets are not grouped. This is related to the reduction in droplets diameter during the evaporation process. Coupling between gas and droplets is shown to decrease the grouping tendency. A qualitative agreement between predictions of the model and in-house experimental observations referring to Diesel engine sprays has been demonstrated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Katoshevski, D.","Shakked, T.","Sazhin, S.S.","Crua, C.","Heikal, M.R."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1019306,"sim:weight":0.502137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Reactions to ageing are known to be strongly positively correlated with attitudes towards older people in general. Moreover, the link between ageist practice and quality of care is also established, but implications for education and training have not been explored.  The aim of this study was to investigate the reactions to ageing of clinical and fieldwork educators of undergraduate students. Clinical and field work educators are largely responsible for all the clinical education received by these students and thus have the potential to be to be highly influential in the development of their attitudes towards the elderly.    Reactions to ageing were measured among clinical educators registered with a University in South East England using The Reaction to Ageing Scale, and scores were classified into typologies.  Results were obtained from 62% (n\u003d87) physiotherapy and 87% (n\u003d81) podiatry clinical educators and 71% (n\u003d53) of occupational therapy fieldwork educators, attending training sessions.

Analysis of qualitative interviews with 30 students reveals that text messaging is the dominant mode of electronic communication amongst students\r\nand plays a central role in maintaining their social networks. The text message dialogue amongst students provides emotional and social peer support and facilitates an informal system of interdependent learning in relation to navigating unfamiliar academic and administrative systems.

On the need for a process ontology of the psychosocial","bibo:abstract":"The articulation of critical dialects of psychology has typically involved a questioning of the foundational assumptions of the so-called mainstream. This has included critiques in the name of more adequate scientific foundations, but more recently these have been accompanied by ctitiques in the name of an absence of foundations altogether, and critiques that suggest a rethinking of the concept of foundation. These latter versions are usually influenced by the great 20th century non-foundational philosophies of figures such as Bergson, Whitehead, Wittgenstein and Heidegger, or by related thinkers such as Deleuze, Serres, Luhmann, Butler and Stengers. In foregrounding themes of process and multiplicity such thinkers provide potent tools for ctitically rethinking psychological questions. Less positive has been a tendency amongst critical psychologists to polarise natural and social scientific issues and to associate the former with negative images (all that is statis, mechanistic, esssentialist and conservative). This can lead to a formulaic criticality in which arguments for nature are bad, and those for culture are good.

Keynote presentations and texts were delivered by each individual, tackling the issue(s) from different points of view, thereby creating a vivid picture of research into sustainable design at the highest level; exploring and defining alternatives to the prevailing logic of consumer society, and to outline the presuppositions for a new state of affairs, a new politics of collective emancipation and a sustainable ethics of design. Chapman urged that material consumption is driven by complex motivations and is about far more than just the acquisition of newer, shinier things, but a personal journey toward the ideal self that, by its nature, becomes a process of serial destructions – a book was published featuring chapters by each specialists entitled, Sustainable Alternatives in Design.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chapman, Jonathan","Predan, B","Krecic, P","Subic, S"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58888,"sim:weight":0.250731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146140,"sim:weight":0.236033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768972,"sim:weight":0.222817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.215976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.209533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.195931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.195656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Waste management facilities throughout the European Union (EU) are overloaded with fully functioning domestic electronic products (DEPs). In many cases, waste of this nature can be seen as nothing more than a symptom of a failed relationship between the user and the product. This is because consumer desire is unstable; it continually evolves and adapts, whilst the DEPs deployed to both mediate and satisfy those desires remain relatively frozen in time. It is this incapacity for evolution and growth that renders most products incapable of both establishing and sustaining relationships with users. The waste this inconsistency generates is substantial, coming at increasing cost to manufacturers facing the policy-driven demands of the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive and, perhaps more importantly, the natural world. We must therefore begin to consider the emergent paradigm of emotionally durable design to propose new and alternative genres of DEPs that reduce the consumption and waste of resources by increasing the resilience of relationships established between consumers and their products; presenting a more expansive, holistic approach to design for durability, and more broadly, the lived experience of sustainability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chapman, Jonathan"],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":5222649,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Book Section","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Subject Object Relationships and Emotionally Durable Design","bibo:abstract":"Design has a central role in the creation of longer user product relationships. Thus far, however, sustainable design methodologies have attended almost exclusively to the somewhat superficial, bodily survival of manufactured objects, to after-effects rather than causes. Durability is as much about emotion, love and attachment as it is about fractured polymers, worn gaskets or blown circuitry. There is little point designing physical durability into goods if consumers lack the desire to keep them. The scope and power of emotional experiences delivered via objects produced through the current system are incredibly limited. Their ability to support and mediate evolving narrative experiences are weak. Commercially viable strategies are needed for emotionally durable objects which engage users on deeper and more profound levels, delivering intense and sophisticated experiences that penetrate the user psyche over longer, more rewarding, periods of time. New, alternative genres of objects could increase the durability of relationships between users and products, people and things. This will demand novel and provocative models of sustainable design capable of developing emotionally durable objects and empowering consumers to transcend the superficial urgencies of conventional consumerism and forge deep emotive connections with their possessions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chapman, Jonathan","Cooper, Tim"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1645542,"sim:weight":0.316775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.270881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771698,"sim:weight":0.257332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54103,"sim:weight":0.199935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186608,"sim:weight":0.196158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.191869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.189993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.186359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447898,"sim:weight":0.185342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051966,"sim:weight":0.182774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.180009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.179196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.179196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.179196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.179196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.179196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.179196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.179196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.179196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.179196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is an extension and refinement of the original ‘TIMELINE’ installation and was made as part of the international group exhibition, ‘AntArctica’, curated by Tone Lyngstad Nyaas; Haugar Vestfold Kunstmuseum, Tonsberg, Norway, September-November 2009. The AntArctica project involved fourteen multi-media artists who have all made work referencing the North or South Poles and the climate or environmental issues concerning them. The town of Tonsberg is the oldest settlement in Norway. The Kunstmuseum has an international reputation, is owned by Vestfold County and has thousands of visitors each year, and the installation was organized through a collaboration between the Kunstmuseum and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research.The importance of TIMELINE-ANTARCTICA within the exhibition is the fact that the electronics contained within it continually produce sounds triggered ‘live’ by the radioactive cosmic ray particles passing into our atmosphere. These sounds could be faintly heard throughout the two floors of the exhibition, acting as a reminder of the continual changes affecting our planet, the viewer`s immediate location and the places and objects depicted in the remainder of the exhibition. The DETECTOR series is concerned with revealing the invisible forces and rhythms that surround us – from light and sound waves through to radioactive particles of ‘stardust’. The development of the series involves research into the use of opto-electronic sound and light sensors, Geiger counters and audio transducers to trigger movement and sound through digital MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) control systems. Movement ranging from the rotation of the Earth, to the viewer`s own movement, down to the rapid movement of a radioactive particle can be utilized to trigger musical sounds and rhythms in the instruments and sculptures that interact with each MIDI interface.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hooker, Charlie","Lyngstad Nyaas, Tone"],"dc:date":"2009-09-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":844715,"sim:weight":0.295627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":844353,"sim:weight":0.277874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":847201,"sim:weight":0.270094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":844357,"sim:weight":0.256934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":848062,"sim:weight":0.229512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5092349,"sim:weight":0.221765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5092352,"sim:weight":0.220462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":844363,"sim:weight":0.213646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5092350,"sim:weight":0.213618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5092348,"sim:weight":0.212921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5092346,"sim:weight":0.212469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5092345,"sim:weight":0.20843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":757313,"sim:weight":0.206854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":846425,"sim:weight":0.200524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":518855,"sim:weight":0.190019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":757842,"sim:weight":0.186884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":859957,"sim:weight":0.180897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145737,"sim:weight":0.180023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":848067,"sim:weight":0.163991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795066,"sim:weight":0.103016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":5222651,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Photography, cinema and medium as social practice","bibo:abstract":"One of the more interesting aspects of the dialogue between the mediums of the still and moving image that has taken place over recent years has been a concern within fine art photography for the cinematic. Photographers have turned to the style and iconography of the established genres of cinema as a means of reinventing the pictorial form of the tableau and thereby to explore the possibilities of narrativity within the static image. However, beyond any aesthetic interest the contemporary genre of the ‘cinematic photograph’ may hold, it is argued here that it may be indicative of an important shift in the social, economic and technological bases of fine art photography. This essay suggests that the significance of the ‘cinematic photograph’ lies in its complex forms of technical production, the mobilisation of skilled labour and professional expertise, and the deployment of substantial economic resources, which are to be found in the film industry. Through an analysis of the work of the American photographer Gregory Crewdson, the authors demonstrate how the formal and iconographic properties of his images are inseparable from his adoption of the cinema’s specific modes of production and that the latter is central to a reading of Crewdson’s photographs. The consequences this holds for our understanding of the medium of photography are developed with reference to Raymond Williams’ concept of ‘medium as social practice’. The authors conclude that the ‘cinematic photograph’ might be regarded as symptomatic of a trend within contemporary art practices to model themselves on cinema as the emblematic form of cultural production of ‘late capitalism’;  a trend that has significant implications for the dominant conceptions concerning the nature of the work of art and the role of the artist.","bibo:AuthorList":["Green, David","Lowry, Joanna"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

She argues that these images can be seen as documentary in as much as they contribute to an understanding of the problem of modernity, of problems of class, the effects of urban industrialization, and of the changing dynamics of the nuclear family.  Arguing that in many ways modernity has itself become a ‘theatre’, she suggests that we can now only properly understand it through the discourse of the uncanny, which emphasizes our sense of the phantasmatic nature of the social world , and our own alienation within it. The staged photography being considered uses a number of theatrical devices – the set, the costume, the prop, the actor, that contribute to this sense of the uncanny and to a re-evaluation of the way in which photography can represent our lived relationship to the real.

Methods: Twenty subjects completed the study after being randomized to intervention or control. The intervention group (n \u003d 10), watched a 19-min video on the benefits of exercise for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and were given a 30-min exercise video, an illustrated exercise diary and an educational booklet about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for use at home. They were advised to follow the exercise video programme 4 times a week for 6 weeks. The control group (n \u003d 10) received the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease educational booklet only. Exercise tolerance was measured using the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test and breathlessness by the self-reported Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire. Results: The median change in the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test and breathlessness score significantly improved in the intervention group compared with the control (+45 m vs –15 m, p \u003d 0.013 and +0.5 vs –0.1 Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire units, p \u003d 0.042).

However, despite these difficulties there has been an explosion of technology-based entrepreneurship in India\u0027s software and IT industries. In theory, the Indian software industry \u0027should not\u0027 have developed in the way it did. This paper shows how Indian software entrepreneurs overcame institutional barriers to development and how they themselves initiated institutional change, despite Government\u0027s restrictive policies. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Indian software firms were able to circumvent government imposed restrictions to growth and lead institutional reform in India. If India\u0027s entrepreneurs can do it perhaps others can too.","bibo:AuthorList":["Athreye, Suma","Hobday, Michael"],"dc:date":"2010-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Although the south-east of England has one of the lowest suicide rates in the UK, Brighton and Hove City PCT has the second highest suicide rate in the country. Our community-oriented \r\n\r\nsuicide research programme has allowed a nuanced approach to the lived experiences of service users in Brighton. \r\n\r\nMethods: This paper will be delivered by representatives from both the university and Brighton and Hove Mind. Two recent suicide research projects are compared and contrasted to highlight the different ways that community partnership can allow both the transfer of knowledge and an orientation toward participation and social change. Project one used participatory action research with two local LGBT groups at risk of suicide-related behaviours. Focus groups allowed an understanding of survival strategies, identity formation and suicidal distress of the LGBT community. Project two involved a multidisciplinary collaboration between services users, council representatives and community organisations to administer and evaluate a local public suicide awareness campaign. \r\n\r\nConclusions: This paper uses both outcome and process narratives to explore the importance of community psychology in suicide research. We explore the negotiations, challenges and limitations of such an approach in generating social change and knowledge transfer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, K.","Jones, Helen","Walker, Carl"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108053,"sim:weight":0.319619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154551,"sim:weight":0.295068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.281099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156168,"sim:weight":0.263723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.261179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710191,"sim:weight":0.255177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107298,"sim:weight":0.244387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.224919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It explores the ways in which a display of near-life-size clay models, complete with indigenous-made manufactures, presented a specific vision of the region to a popular British audience. Using visual evidence, archival material and contemporary commentary on the exhibition, the essay investigates the mechanics of the exhibition paradigm, documenting its impact upon audiences’ perceptions of the Andamanese peoples. It argues that the models were intended and were successfully received as tools with which to popularize scholarly judgements of the region’s peoples at the lowest point of a perceived sociocultural-evolutionary hierarchy, and demonstrates how this specific exhibit was employed as dynamic, decorative visual entertainment for a metropolitan audience. The implications of the substitution of clay figures for real human bodies will be examined, and it will be argued that this particular medium acted as an absorbent surface upon which British audiences could safely posit perceived ‘truths’ about their distant subjects. Whereas ‘living exhibits’ were able to challenge the terms of their representation, the static models were seen to verify colonial concerns regarding the violent depravity, overt sexuality and corporeal availability of the non-Western ‘other’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wintle, Claire"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382030,"sim:weight":0.531845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382026,"sim:weight":0.496211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382973,"sim:weight":0.451465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.44754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.447036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44647,"sim:weight":0.445894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.438228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.437896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383636,"sim:weight":0.435928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.434167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771724,"sim:weight":0.428041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43380,"sim:weight":0.417822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.417388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051966,"sim:weight":0.414934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145840,"sim:weight":0.413039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43223,"sim:weight":0.411916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.408372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.407635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48276,"sim:weight":0.406207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709917,"sim:weight":0.405318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Net.Weight examined the potential for increased, innovative and effective uses of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support the self management of weight. The research was conducted in the city of Brighton and Hove by an inter-disciplinary team from the University of Brighton. The paper gives a brief overview of the various methods used in the study as a whole but discusses one strand, the user survey, in more detail. The survey gathered data on people’s information and ICT use around weight management. The design of the survey questionnaire required the adaptation of existing literacy assessment instruments and this process is described in this paper. The findings show that people use a wide range of information sources for information and support around weight management. The most useful sources are slimming groups, food packaging, friends and family, magazines, TV and health books, thus representing a variety of media, formal and informal, and including human sources. The internet was reported to be a useful source for around half the survey respondents and is most often used for information about diet and exercise. A majority of respondents described themselves as active information seekers and confident about their information skills. They are less confident about internet information than information generally and even less confident about using the internet to support weight management activities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marshall , Audrey M.","Henwood, F.","Carlin, Leslie","Guy, Elizabeth S.","Sinozic, Tanja","Smith, Helen"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99137,"sim:weight":0.575867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.53533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.489542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16179,"sim:weight":0.462704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.451303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.45085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187723,"sim:weight":0.429767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.42969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.414546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper demonstrates that the interaction between people is an important aspect of the information process, which is often neglected in the literature. It suggests that exploring the user-user dimension might add to the understanding of information effectiveness. It also suggests that an approach to information and health literacy which includes a social as well as an individual perspective is necessary. On quality assessment it supports findings from other studies that organisational authority is a key measure of reliability for lay users and that quality assessment tools have a limited role in the assessment process.

The ‘mobilities turn’ in social science draws attention to the significance of a range of mobilities, from everyday to global. In tandem, visualization of virtual and lived spatial and social contexts is increasingly central to everyday lives and wider social processes. Both mobile and visual methods have evolved to reflect the epistemological changes that accompany these realizations, leading to a mobility of method as approaches draw from a range of disciplines. Online resources present particular opportunities for the expansion of these methods. For example, video methods can be adapted for online use in collecting visual data whilst on the move and this data can then be disseminated in video form through the Internet. However, this interrelationship between online, mobile and visual methods has not been fully explored to date. This chapter explores the ways in which these methods can be combined to create knowledge in a unique way. It assesses the efficacy of these methodologies and methods by reviewing existing research and draws out key themes for analysis and further development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murray, Lesley","Nunes Silva, Carlos"],"dc:date":"2012-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4187769,"sim:weight":0.337643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645863,"sim:weight":0.298381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187738,"sim:weight":0.284199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83543,"sim:weight":0.276079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.272473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151793,"sim:weight":0.272021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.269278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9321182,"sim:weight":0.262195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.252495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193234,"sim:weight":0.246328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.245353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.241016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.23962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664681,"sim:weight":0.237483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.234351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.234351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.234351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.234351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.234351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86094,"sim:weight":0.232329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Participants 14 employed users of a United Kingdom job retention project, with a range of mental health problems. Methods Semi structured individual interviews which were collaboratively designed with service users. Data analysis involved deductive and inductive thematic analysis, constant comparative analysis, and service user collaboration. Results  Participants feelings of guilt and self blame were a major obstacle to job retention. The project helped them address these by supporting a reappraisal of their situation. This assisted identification of job accommodations and adjustments and confidence in self advocacy. Thus an important basis for improved dialogue with their employer was established. A peer support group provided an important adjunct to individual project worker interventions. 10 participants retained employment, three of those who did not were helped to retain work aspirations. Conclusions The project effectively used a multi faceted approach involving a person  environment occupation focus on the worker, their work, and workplace.

However, while critics voice concerns about the renascent downtowns being increasingly privatized and inscribed through displacement-inducing gentrification, a seemingly inexorable rise in inequality also prompts misgivings about the social and geographical reach of any purported renaissance. Appreciative of this, the New Labour government introduced as part of its sustainable communities plan an initiative called Housing Market Renewal, designed to reconnect distressed areas of ‘low demand’ to the vibrant city centres. However, the extent to which this endeavour to stretch the frontier of England\u0027s urban renaissance is premised upon a fundamentalist faith in private property inclines us to delineate it as an archetypical case of late-neoliberalizing accumulation by dispossession that licenses state-orchestrated gentrification. We go on to consider how the landscape conversions precipitated by the renaissance vision have been convened alongside an unprecedented expansion of policies for crime control, designed to instil a particular version of ‘civility’ within the urban and suburban vernacular. The article thereby reveals how politically orchestrated endeavours to induce an urban renaissance appear to be increasingly intertwined with gentrification and a punitive urbanism, and how this chimes with experiences across many parts of the urban world.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacLeod, Gordon","Johnstone, Craig"],"dc:date":"2012-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85536,"sim:weight":0.716395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181445,"sim:weight":0.668549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8792537,"sim:weight":0.543894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108867,"sim:weight":0.543454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109122,"sim:weight":0.521523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3640,"sim:weight":0.462151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.443411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.443411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43845,"sim:weight":0.427873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.359897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.338507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.326578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75773,"sim:weight":0.296497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.284848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109002,"sim:weight":0.283536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108250,"sim:weight":0.229237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The EU has emerged as a potential ally for the transnational Roma community as it possesses normative power when espousing values such as inclusion, yet is able to elaborate policy at a supranational level which has supremacy over domestic policy. Thus far EU Roma policy has failed to address the complex issues facing Roma owing to inadequate policy interventions.

{"identifier":5222682,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"How do big rivers come to be different?","bibo:abstract":"Big rivers dominate the world’s continental surface, yet we are still learning about how they operate and whether they are explicably different, not only from each other, but also from smaller rivers. This paper uses global satellite imagery and ground field-experience to explain and illustrate why and how big rivers are strongly differentiated.\r\nAt the largest scale, trans-continent sized rivers do not possess unified valley systems created by fluvial erosion but instead involve chains of interlinked domains with contrasted\r\nfluvial functions. Alluvial settings are dependent on mainstream and tributary inputs of water and sediment, but big river channel pattern variety is determined by contrasts in sediment feed-rates and differences in the rates and routes of sediment exchange. Four modes of alluvial exchange are recognised: (i) deposition on the floodplain (e.g., levees, infilled palaeochannels, floodbasins), (ii) exchanges involving main channels (e.g., bank erosion and accretion), (iii) deposition within main channels (e.g. bedforms from metres to 10s of kilometres in size), and (iv) material input from tributaries (sediment-rich or sediment-poor). Different combinations of sedimentation activity lead to floodplain morphologies for big rivers that can be classified into four types: (i) lacustrine-dominated, (ii) mainstream-dominated, (iii)tributary or accessory-stream dominated, and (iv) confined or bedrock-dominated.\r\nChannel patterning involves a range of main-channel, branch and floodplain styles promoted by variable sediment feeds, complex bed sediment transfers, variable lateral sediment exchanges, plural channel systems and incomplete mineral sedimentation of the hydraulic corridors set by tectonics and prior-valley trenching. In some of the world’s largest rivers it is accessory and tributary channels, rather than main-river branches, which determine patterns of floodplain morphology. In some big rivers, but certainly not all, ponded lacustrine environments are common, with water bodies that vary from smaller water-filled swales and palaeochannels, to floodbasins and km-scale linear lakes in sediment-dammed tributaries. Organic sedimentation is significant along relatively sediment-poor and laterally stable large rivers that fail to fill their alluvial corridors. Three case studies are used to illustrate this variability in big river pattern and process: the Ob, Jamuna and Paraná. These rivers are respectively dominated by meandering, braiding and mixed mainstream and accessory channel morphologies.\r\nBig rivers have some processes and patterns that are different 48 from smaller rivers including: (i) no simple down-valley sequence in control variables and channel pattern, (ii)main channels with high width:depth ratios, (iii) few or no channel-wide unit bars migrating through the main thalwegs, (iv) extensive and low-gradient floodplains that provide space for channel shifting and floodplain sedimentation, (v) long distances between significant tributaries to allow full mixing of water and sediment discharges, (vi) in some places, partially decoupled channels and floodplains, and (vii) significant floodplain water bodies that readily act as sinks for fine-grained sediment where this is supplied, or organic deposition.\r\nAlthough understanding of contemporary big river patterns requires attention to a range of timescales, including inheritance from sediments of Quaternary age, big rivers do have a distinctive character. The variety of patterns of big rivers may usefully be viewed in terms of sediment systems operating at both the catchment and reach scales. Intra-river variability and internal complexity show the need to understand contrasted sediment supply, through put and alluvial exchange as determinants of big river morphology and pattern.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ashworth, P.J.","Lewin, J."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5225585,"sim:weight":0.554087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393889,"sim:weight":0.413494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":659052,"sim:weight":0.366829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270937,"sim:weight":0.292921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631719,"sim:weight":0.263251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98619,"sim:weight":0.254925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1016333,"sim:weight":0.139356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article considers how the agency of workers and users shapes the processes of mediation, negotiation and adaptation that occur in different service delivery contexts, and identifies ways in which resistance to intended policy outcomes, and to the practices expected to deliver them, is formed and expressed.

The event received support from the Economic History Society and the Society for the Study of Labour History.  It asked how the British Co-operative movement responded to changes in economic, social, cultural and political spheres during the twentieth century; as well as interrogating its impact on social movements, politics, business practice, and consumption over what has conventionally been perceived as a period of slow decline.   The resulting book makes a substantial contribution during what appears to be a renaissance of interest in Co-operative history, and, in fact, a renaissance in Co-operative fortunes.\r\n\r\nWhitworth’s chapter is concerned with the relatively unknown but prolonged engagement between the Council of Industrial Design and the Co-operative.  It draws on a particularly rich set of accounts of site visits made by Council staff at the Co-op’s request during 1957, which are ‘revelatory of the conditions pertaining in the productive units of “Britain’s biggest business”, and disclose how far from an integrated, systematised model of production the CWS manufacturing operation really was’ (p.183).  As such it usefully supplements the work by Woodham (1999) which has as its focus an ill-fated joint initiative to introduce more advanced furniture design to the Co-operative’s customers.  \r\n\r\nThis new chapter is also imbued with concerns carried through from Whitworth’s ‘Cultures of Consumption’ work looking at the development of product standards as a consumer protection and engagement mechanism.  The Co-op was of interest to the Council precisely because the wide ambit of its activities included production, wholesaling and retailing roles, giving it the potential to be the most useful possible ally for its own missionary agenda.  The Co-op’s historic insistence on its role as a guardian of standards and champion for ordinary shoppers naturally gave added impetus to the relationship.   Reference is made to the inadequacy of the Co-op’s market research capability; the poor correlation between manufacturing and retailing ends of its operations; and its limited capacity to promote well-designed goods even when these did exist.  Notwithstanding any of these features, there continued to be renewals of investment by both sides in the proposition of a mutually enriching partnership throughout the period under scrutiny.","bibo:AuthorList":["Whitworth, Lesley","Black, Lawrence","Robertson, Nicole"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Neoliberalism, as imposed for example through the orthodoxy of the creative city, continues to have profound implications for the everyday nature of city life. Above all perhaps, this orthodoxy has created a city that is increasingly defined by elites through and by consumption. In this context cities appear to have become increasingly defined by disparities of wealth and are thus the product of a situation in which the opportunities they engender are more open to some social groups than they are to others. Acknowledging this to be the case, this article considers the suggestion that a tendency to condemn the neoliberal city without sufficient recourse to how that city is experienced by consumers may result in an underestimation of the subtleties of the neoliberal project. Furthermore, ‘consumer studies\u0027 may, as a result, be destined to exist on the disciplinary fringes where the paradoxes with which it grapples can be more easily contained. The article calls for a re-evaluation of the neoliberal city as an emotional experiential entity in which active forms of consumption might potentially take place.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Steven"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.525601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109122,"sim:weight":0.499649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.485582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.453752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85536,"sim:weight":0.435529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109078,"sim:weight":0.429737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.422633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.418807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.41208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710039,"sim:weight":0.41119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.41011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.409041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634697,"sim:weight":0.403965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.402697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43173,"sim:weight":0.399395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.393299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.389838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145517,"sim:weight":0.38528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.383461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.381885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The ontology of the terms employed in business process engineering is discussed, and formal definitions of the main terms are given. The term \"temporal model\" of a business process is introduced, and a formal definition of a sub-process is given with relation to the temporal model. A sub-process can be viewed as a module of a business process which can be replaced or altered without affecting the rest of the process. It is shown that existing business process models using business process modelling can be given a logical foundation based on formal temporal theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petridis, M.","Ma, J.","Knight, B."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Fabrics are sold by the metre or bespoke designed. The company takes inspiration from the functional and aesthetic heritage of traditional British wool whilst embracing innovation in luxury textiles. Early Burberry and McIntosh are inspirational in their adoption of fabric innovation in conjunction with classic British design. The company is dedicated to the evolution of traditional aesthetics and production methods. It embraces the links between heritage and contemporary design innovation in the form of hardwearing, functional, luxury products. This paper will focus on international client case studies that have chosen to work with Dashing Tweeds, exploring the market demand and desire for UK produced heritage inspired, innovative products in luxury menswear.\r\nTweed is a traditional British woollen fabric woven in variations of a twill structure from rough spun blended wool, traditionally used for outdoor activities such as fishing and hunting due to its moisture resistance and durability. Harris Tweed has been hand woven in the Western Isles for many years and is synonymous with British textiles. This method of hand production, high quality materials and durability seals its status as a luxury fabric in the context of the current fast moving fashion cycle. It is imbued with the emotive notion of the landscape and culture which inspires it. It evokes a response in menswear that appeals to memory and nostalgia of less ephemeral and disposable fashion. Much of its appeal is bound up in its association with home spun production, ‘authenticity’, melange of colour and functionality.\r\n Dashing tweeds combines the heritage of tweed and the use of technical yarn to produce fabrics which have a sense of tradition with an innovative function. Fine reflective filaments are woven into woollen suiting using a variety of new and traditional structures that allude to the tweed aesthetic. A current project is exploring the use of carbon nanotube/polymer composites imbedded in wool textiles with a view to creating fabrics that are recognisable as tweed but possesses hidden function. Designs are based around traditional checks, twills and herringbones. Colour inspiration comes from the surrounding changing environment, much in the same way as traditional tweeds were inspired by the landscape of rural Scotland and Ireland. Dashing Tweeds colour comes from the urban environment of double yellow lines, wet pavements and the parks and architecture of London. \r\nDashing Tweeds appeals to a menswear market that doesn’t want an obviously innovative looking aesthetic but enjoys the technical aspect through hidden innovation in a heritage inspired textile. Through analysing the relationship between Dashing Tweeds and their client base, the paper will address market demand and relevance of such a company and discuss the importance of heritage inspired cloth, innovation in materials and sustainable production to the brand strategy and future of Dashing Tweeds and their clients. \r\nCopyright Kirsty McDougall 2011-05-06","bibo:AuthorList":["McDougall, Kirsty"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1123059,"sim:weight":0.259489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634214,"sim:weight":0.25814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9549856,"sim:weight":0.256356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1123020,"sim:weight":0.254658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102639,"sim:weight":0.246745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634851,"sim:weight":0.237937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634695,"sim:weight":0.225551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771697,"sim:weight":0.221566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.21787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771838,"sim:weight":0.210372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.207596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771698,"sim:weight":0.204835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.204707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.204707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.204707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.204707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.204707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.204707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.204707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.204707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It considers the unique role of such figures in crossing the exclusion/inclusion boundary within the arts and developing more personal approaches to marketing activities in their institutions through relationship-building.  While it is acknowledged here that such workers find themselves in a privileged position in being able to shape questions of taste and particular consumerist dispositions to understanding the art world, little, if not no effort has been made to understand this process. As such, there remains a void between the cultural policy-oriented conception of social inclusion, which implies a version of repairing the ‘flawed consumer’ (Bauman 2005), and the way in which such policy is played out on the ground.","bibo:AuthorList":["Durrer, Victoria","Miles, Steven"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Yet little known about this artist whose work is so conspicuous, or about the sculpture he produced in London before emigration; on the facade of the V and A, outside the Royal School of Mines, and elsewhere in the capital. Based on the recently discovered letters of the sculptor Paul Montford (1868-1938), this book re-establishes a unique connection between the sculpture of two cities and exposes the professional networks that were maintained over great distance. It is the result of four years of research in Australia and Britain that has attracted funding and fellowships from universities in both countries. \r\n\r\nThe book explores the significance of sculpture in furnishing the public spaces and institutions of the city of Melbourne with commemorative portraits of exemplary Australians and memorials in honour of the war dead. The Shrine of Remembrance, the statue to Adam Lindsay Gordon in Spring Street, John Wesley in Lonsdale Street and Peter Pan at Melbourne Zoo, are all well-known landmarks that are reconnected with their London precedents in this new cross-disciplinary history. Through Montford’s revealing and engaging correspondence, readers will discover a first-hand account of the cultural life of Melbourne between the wars. The book reconsiders this artist’s role in the transformation of the civic landscape of Victoria, both urban and rural, and the part his work played in the processes of public history, of representation and denial, issues that remain central to the study of Australia’s past.\r\n\r\nThis book presents in a vivid and original way, previously inaccessible archival material of great value to Australia’s cultural history and to the study of the expanded networks of British artistic practice. Located within family papers in Britain, these visual and textual sources document the professional activities and private concerns of a sculptor who played a major role in how Melbourne appears today. Paul Montford’s work raises issues of intense contemporary interest to art historians and academics in the humanities namely, commemoration, cultural memory, inter-textuality, and visual and material culture. This book offers a new perspective on the inter-war tension between art founded on European values and demands for an art integral to an Australian context. It addresses the difficulties of an English artist establishing his reputation anew, the professional jealousies this provoked within the Melbourne art scene of the 1920s, and the persistence of professional ties between Melbourne and London. Complementing its broader reach, this study also offers a unique insight into the day-to-day activities of an artist, the logistics of making sculpture, and the complex emotional locus of the home and studio. Moreover, in documenting the significance of connections with London and elsewhere, this book also addresses ideas about art as an international exchange and establishes for the first time a relationship between Montford’s sculpture in both continents. In this way, it appeals to audiences in Britain and forms part of growing academic interest in Australia-British cultural crosscurrents and exchange. It complements the large-scale University of Glasgow research project ‘Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951’ and anticipates the international extension of this work in the years ahead.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moriarty, Catherine"],"dc:date":"2012-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8169,"sim:weight":0.458449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.361281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771724,"sim:weight":0.325873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.318624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.316307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.314018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.310215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382030,"sim:weight":0.306086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197556,"sim:weight":0.304701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43299,"sim:weight":0.298476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.295515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.292261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.292152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771816,"sim:weight":0.290533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43014,"sim:weight":0.287268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.286436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.283548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145840,"sim:weight":0.28214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634697,"sim:weight":0.28006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.275553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The project built upon the successful Sounding Out the Museum performance in Nimes in June 2008 in which new works were performed in the atrium of the Musee des Beaux Arts as a response to the Between Two Heads exhibition by Peter Seddon.\r\n\r\nThe Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin is the site for the famous Francis Bacon Studio. In 1998, John Edwards, Francis Bacon’s sole heir, donated the entire contents of Bacon’s studio at 7 Reece Mews to the Hugh Lane Gallery. The studio was subsequently transported, speck by speck to Dublin andreassembled in the Hugh Lane Gallery.\r\n\r\nIn his book ‘Inside the White Cube’ Brian O’ Doherty defends the ‘real life of the world against the sterilized operating room of the white cube – defends time and change against the myth of the eternality and transcendence of pure form’. The Francis Bacon studio is one such example of the changing landscape of museums and galleries in which the chaotic, the banal, the ad hoc take their place amongst the permanent, stable and the fixed.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the Studio raises questions for museology. The artist’s studio is a place of trial and error, a place for testing new materials, a place of discarded projects. It is the site in which work is made, but it is not the work. In creating the Francis Bacon Studio at Hugh Lane Gallery, new boundaries are defined in the practices of museology.\r\n\r\nIt is into this context that ensemble Scratch the Surface were invited by the Hugh Lane Gallery to curate a performance which explored through sound and movement questions of hybrid practices in Gallery spaces raised by the Francis Bacon Studio.\r\n\r\nHugh Lane Gallery presents Bacon’s studio as a site for artistic and aesthetic interest, similarly the work mounted by ensemble Scratch the Surface raised specific questions around sound, museology and hybrid practices in terms of site and genres.\r\n\r\nThe work ‘upon the place beneath’ by Claudia Kappenberg explored a fascination with ‘process’ through oblique approaches to movement and sound. The project examined the role of ‘preparation’ and ‘chance’ within music  improvisation.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the performance work of Conall Gleeson and Jean Martin examined the role of ‘preparation’ in the production of sound, investigating the process by which sound is produced  prior to its performance as well as the production of new sound during the performance, as is the case during music improvisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gleeson, Conall","Martin, Jean"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.298355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.259711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.246252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.233034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.230495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051969,"sim:weight":0.227688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.225713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771724,"sim:weight":0.222064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710128,"sim:weight":0.217205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225608,"sim:weight":0.217158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101399,"sim:weight":0.216254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58923,"sim:weight":0.215277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.21526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.214441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.210903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351671,"sim:weight":0.210054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340778,"sim:weight":0.206815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.203966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43953,"sim:weight":0.203277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051960,"sim:weight":0.202629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The multi-disciplinary event was a response to the resurgence of interest in design as a collective practice, and as a core component of social activism.  The research underpinning Whitworth’s work was ESRC-AHRC funded within the Cultures of Consumption research project, and drew heavily on primary sources in the National Archives and the University of Brighton Design Archives.  It took as its focus the first government-sponsored design-promotional body in the world; the United Kingdom’s Council of Industrial Design (Design Council from 1972).  \r\n\r\nThe work recovered an energetic programme of public engagement and consumer education.  The Council’s first Director, in particular, refused to contemplate the role before agreement was reached on this aspect of its otherwise significantly industrial remit.  The vision developed by the fledgling organisation was of a virtuous circle, within which people were able to respond critically to their material environment, and articulate the wishes and needs that would underpin future product development and materials research.  These early years coincided with the country’s turbulent period of economic and social re-alignment, as peacetime manufacturing and reconstruction resumed.  Taken as a whole, the volume resonates with current debates arising from present day economic challenges within the creative economy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Whitworth, Lesley","Edquist , Harriet","Vaughan, Laurene"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.328119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381996,"sim:weight":0.287592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.284838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.28127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998629,"sim:weight":0.274786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.270751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Many thousands of people visited the installation, which was featured on the DLWP website. The gallery also organized a Vimeo broadcast of an interview with Hooker concerning the work. The project overall featured contributions from researchers based at the universities of Brighton and Reading. Postgraduate students from University of Brighton were also invited to contribute to a supporting exhibition. AUDIO ACCOMPANIMENT features a MIDI-controlled grand ‘Clavinova’ grand piano, which is triggered ‘live’ by cosmic ray particles to play a never-ending sequence of notes. The keys of the MIDI-controlled piano move in a ghostly, magical way to produce sound each time a radioactive ‘stardust’ particle hits the Geiger counter, MIDI controller and laptop that are all connected to the piano via its USB input. The piano was sponsored by Yamah UK and involved direct negotiations and modifications between Hooker, the DLWP and Yamaha. Cosmic ray particles pass through each square metre of the earth approximately every 3 seconds, so that the MIDI/Geiger counter-controlled sequence sets up an on-going series of random notes and harmonies, creating silences, then flurries of activity in a mysterious and intriguing way. The particle activity is thought by scientists to have an impact on our current weather patterns and the work was developed in collaboration with meteorologists from the University of Reading to help them explain this process through an accompanying text. The installation`s inherent concepts have a particular affinity to Cage`s work and his general philosophy regarding chance and belief systems. The notion of stars, cosmic rays and the universe allude to our own mortality and unpredictability, so that the idea of this somewhat ghostly work accompanying the changing installation of this particular dead artist`s work had a specific poignancy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hooker, Charlie"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.224314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.218724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051962,"sim:weight":0.216084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.204265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105058,"sim:weight":0.203724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181803,"sim:weight":0.203104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.20275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051960,"sim:weight":0.202273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.196654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108179,"sim:weight":0.195543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.194868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.192102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771816,"sim:weight":0.191614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.191248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.190891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.188219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.187421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.18695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.186343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46605,"sim:weight":0.18553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Habermas argues that communication harbours an implicit promise, that it is underpinned by a a claim to be valid which is in principle subject to verification. A close reading of Habermas\u0027s badic theoretical decisions demosntrates what communicative rationality occludes in the study of language. Habermas sidelines concerns about the ineliminable power underlying any communication, and occludes any focus on the slipperiness of meaning. \r\n\r\nThe critique has implications for the theoretical defence of deliberative democracy, the topic of so much secondary work in political studies nowadays. In the second section of the article I contend that Habermas’s account of reason is incapable of addressing two key political questions: economic inequality and bio-politics. This failure is a consequence of the way in which Habermas constructs reason, as communicative.  The consequence is that any account of reason or deliberation premised upon formal pragmatics should be reconstructed. This reconstruction will need to give account of the violence that underpins the deliberative account of democracy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Devenney, Mark"],"dc:date":"2009-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108167,"sim:weight":0.420738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5764248,"sim:weight":0.417089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2408,"sim:weight":0.364813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145547,"sim:weight":0.337156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99778,"sim:weight":0.328073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3781,"sim:weight":0.323727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1353350,"sim:weight":0.299115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187748,"sim:weight":0.290933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145179,"sim:weight":0.287822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710491,"sim:weight":0.287304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":857,"sim:weight":0.28239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43958,"sim:weight":0.275865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187758,"sim:weight":0.270668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383315,"sim:weight":0.269385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710204,"sim:weight":0.263937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43934,"sim:weight":0.26383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45399,"sim:weight":0.258804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1353349,"sim:weight":0.257985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":858,"sim:weight":0.257708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83594,"sim:weight":0.257636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However the industry is changing, due to devaluation of design on the one hand and economic pressure and re-evaluation of design ethics coupled with consumer integrity on the other. This paper addresses the emerging retail landscape, where production and consumption practices are separating like oil and water. We are witnessing a paradigm shift with regard to business models, where the new consumer desires and is demanding high value, performance and smart ethical fashion. These consumers expect co-creation, innovation, opportunities through customisation, supply chain transparency and business integrity, to build an ongoing relationship with a retailers ‘no worry’ brand. They are generation ‘C’, who often purchase from virtual retail environments, and who understand the relevance of design for behavioural change, and the true cost of products both in material and human terms. Sustainability, or people, profit, planet, inherent in the bedrock of a cradle-to-cradle fashion textiles system of the near future. \r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, fashion is worth 326 million NZD in exports (NZTE, 2008) and as elsewhere the insatiability of the mainstream fashion consumer is being satisfied by an escalation of ‘pile it high, sell it cheap’ outlets. Here the ‘dollar a day’ dress (Marks, 2005) made by a significant silent workforce of slave labourers, refugees, illegal workers and children exist in the black manufacturing economy, even here in the back streets of Auckland (Cumming, 2002). Consumer responses during the recent recession (Euromonitor, 2010; Vass, 2009) are poles apart, customers buying wisely what is needed, with integrity, in contrast to the pressure of ‘buy one, get one free’ and the frenzy of a fashion bargain. With these attitudes working in tandem, this paper predicts an unsustainable global manufacturing fashion/textile industry will continue to run parallel to an emerging model of fashion/textiles design and business systems. \r\n\r\nFashion textile literature and theory relating to sustainability is often emotive, fragmented and vague. This positioning paper argues that a polarisation, or separation, of the producer, consumer, disposal and reuse markets is already taking place in the best and the worst of the industry, on every high street and mall. To illustrate this division we have focused on two fictitious adjacent clothing stores in the high street of 2018: we predict a continuation of the unsustainable global manufacturing fashion textile industry as Shop Two; running in parallel to an emerging new paradigm of fashion and textiles found in Shop One. \r\n\r\nThis thesis has been developed by focussing on issues of sustainability, comparing existing fashion/textile retail supply and disposal chains and analysis of the cause-and-effect, using guiding principles from cradle-to-grave analysis and systemic reasoning. It is underpinned by, and reflects upon the knowledge of current local and global fashion/textile design business practice and data which forms the context for thinking through design to enable change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farrer, Joan","Fraser, Kim"],"dc:date":"2012-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The commission was organized in collaboration with Prof Eystein Janssen, awarded the Nobel Peace prize for his work on climate change in 2007, currently Director of the BCCR Norwegian Centre for Excellence. The physicists, paleoclimatologists and technical researchers who worked with Hooker to prepare the project are all researchers and educators with international standing. The installation was viewed by several hundred people during the symposium and thousands when re-installed in the Student reception Building. An interview with Hooker was also broadcast on Norwegian Radio. The work linked researchers from post-graduate students through to professors from the universities of Brighton, Reading, Exeter and Bergen. TIMELINE 2 is the second in a series of works that takes cosmic ray activity as its starting point. This invisible yet universal phenomenon involves the bombardment of the planet with a never-ending series of tiny radioactive particles, emitted from our sun and every sun. In these works, Hooker uses Geiger counters to detect the particles as they travel through each installation, and creates switching systems to trigger audio-visual activity in the work each time a ray strikes it. TIMELINE 2 is a work that links 11,000 years of climate data revealed in a Norwegian lacustrine mud core to the current activity of cosmic rays bombarding our planet. It uses the effect of these invisible radioactive particles to make Geiger counters trigger ‘live’  beats from the two drums situated at either end of the core each time a particle hits one of them. Revealing such ‘buried history’ contained within a mud core is of great importance to understanding climate change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hooker, Charlie"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":97878,"sim:weight":0.237589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.222889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.216707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87043,"sim:weight":0.215739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.207866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.201172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.20074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A different significance is ascribed to these words when they are used to in conjunction with the word camp, and consequently they call forth a different appreciation of interior. \r\nThe word camp lends a casual and contingent quality to suggest informal dwelling, conditional inhabitation and an occupation wedded to time more than to place. Camp spaces always contain something of the extraordinary or the exceptional. They are commonly fashioned for recreation and pleasure, or occur as a consequence of natural disaster, conflict or displacement. They speak of both the momentary event and the marginal space. Camps therefore accommodate an increasingly diverse set of occupants – tourists, pilgrims, cadets, refugees, migrants, soldiers, activists, humanitarian workers and detainees. People can (and do), set up camp in any space. Camps may occur as temporary shelters in sports grounds, airport lounges, and\r\nuniversities; they may be deliberately implanted into disused buildings; or occur as forms of illegal occupation in houses. \r\nThis paper will focus on one particular form of camp, which is at the centre of questions of identity, residency, safety and mobility.

It’s a wonderful story – a deceptively simple tale that has incredible psychological depth so it works on a number of levels. Dorothy’s journey is really about a personality that’s trying to become complete. At its core it holds an important life lesson: that the things we yearn for or the qualities we think we lack are already a part of us, but we invariably need to go on the journey to make this discovery. \r\nL. Frank Baum’s original text, is richly populated with strange and wonderful characters not featured in the classic 1939 film: the Dainty China people, ornament-size folk made from porcelain who are prone to breakages, and the Hammer Heads, armless fighters with extendable necks and hard, flat heads. These have rarely, if ever, been depicted before so it was a great opportunity to bring them to life, as well as reinterpreting the more familiar characters.There are extra scenes, as well as back story that reveals the origin of the Winged Monkeys, how the Tin Woodman came to be made of tin, and how the Emerald City only appears green because its inhabitants are made to wear green tinted spectacles.\r\nI’ve been faithful to the original text, but my own way of thinking inevitably comes through. In my version, Dorothy’s dog Toto is a push-along toy on wheels. It may seem like a glib decision, but it tells us something about Dorothy’s view of reality. And it’s funny, because in the book, he doesn’t really do anything. When Toto is ready to go to sleep, they just tip him over on his side.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rawle, Graham","Baum, L.Frank"],"dc:date":"2008-10-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1444997,"sim:weight":0.347535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710663,"sim:weight":0.336396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154412,"sim:weight":0.324905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1344239,"sim:weight":0.324645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43311,"sim:weight":0.311827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23659,"sim:weight":0.307023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9559,"sim:weight":0.305812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.305588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.292314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44084,"sim:weight":0.291768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.284681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710667,"sim:weight":0.282809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45883,"sim:weight":0.281413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44568,"sim:weight":0.278433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769036,"sim:weight":0.277252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.274595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99288,"sim:weight":0.269344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56445,"sim:weight":0.269095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763965,"sim:weight":0.262317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666433,"sim:weight":0.260437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Organised around the ludic rheme, \u0027Twice the Va Va Voom\u0027, and the critical valorisation, \u0027French car, British designers\u0027, the advertising campaign, launched in 2005, elaborates a double-code that sets up the idea of the \u0027country-of-origin\u0027 as a contest, pitting Britain, in the guise of Ben, against France, in the guise of Sophie. As such, the commercial identity of the car is performatively imbricated, scene-by-scene, with cultural phenomena from both France and Britain - engineering, food, literature, and romance. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, I deal with the tension between sameness and difference in Anglo-French relations that the verbal and visual rhetoric of the publicity connotes in the context of the \u0027entente cordiale\u0027. I take into account the way the ad campaign simultaneously maintains and deconstructs the cultural, social and historical stereotypes that exist on the ‘outside’, addressing sex and gender identities, white nationalism and white foreignness, and the racial blind spots of the advertisement in comparison to the preceding \u0027Va Va Voom\u0027 campaign, which starred the black footballer Thierry Henry. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, as we observe Ben and Sophie driving their respective Clios around London and Paris in the television advertisement, and the conjunction of London and Paris signified in the poster, the city is objectified as a kind of meeting point or passage for the negotiation of new social relations and networks that enunciate the transition from political to commercial globalism in the Single European Market. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research paper was originally delivered as a keynote address for the Design History Society Annual Conference, ‘Writing Design - Process: Object: Discourse: Translation’ at the University of Hertfordshire, 3-5 September 2009.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jobling, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":5222736,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Book Section","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Between words and images: simulation, deconstruction and postmodern photography","bibo:abstract":"This catalogue essay attempts to unravel how and why the cult of the image is most expressly manifest in postmodernism by a concern with hyper-reality or the simulacral – the revival of the Platonic idea that a copy is made of an original which never really existed in the first place. The high priest of such thinking is Jean Baudrillard, who insists that we take flight from reality by reproducing images based on other images with the result that we no longer have the propensity to tell representation and reality apart. The mass media have a crucial part to play here and there is obviously something in Baudrillard’s argument when it comes to considering visual cultural forms like reality television and the constant rehashing of imagery in advertising and photography. Yet, when we consider the representation of the human body as a site for the exercise and regulation of power in advertising for Benetton and Levis 501 or Cindy Sherman’s untitled film stills, it doesn’t suffice to argue, as both he and Dick Hebdige after him have done, that all hyperreal texts are devoid of serious comment or political content. Moreover, Baudrillard’s thesis capsizes the relationship that still exists between words and images in postmodern political posters by the likes of Barbara Kruger or photo-essays for The Face such as \u0027Strategies for the Unemployed\u0027 or \u0027Who\u0027s Shooting Who? In Beirut It Pays to Know Your Terrorist\u0027. Thus, as I argue, we also need to consider Jacques Derrida’s contention that the deconstruction of any text is more a matter of dealing with ‘multiple reading heads’, of resisting a system based on binary oppositions, and accordingly, a question of pondering the intertextuality of word and image.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jobling, Paul","Adamson, Glenn","Pavitt, Jane"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.471078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352132,"sim:weight":0.470256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.454808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.454382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.441662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43882,"sim:weight":0.436042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.434112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.433751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.428289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.4184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.418077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44028,"sim:weight":0.416992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.416662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.416574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.411489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.409034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.406387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.405805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99028,"sim:weight":0.404248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.404154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

And he is right when he goes on to add that ‘This is like reacting to a series of police killings with proposals to reform the law on homicide so as to sanction officially approved pre-trial executions.\u0027\r\n\r\nIt is because the general public is taking these academics seriously that there is an urgent need to expose how spurious their ideologically driven arguments are. The “respectability” they confer on the argument that so-called ticking bombs justify torture, and that it had therefore better be regulated, needs to be countered. Otherwise there is a real danger that western politicians will succeed in persuading us to go along with them when they insist that another basic freedom – freedom from torture – is yet one more value we must abandon in the endless “war on terrorism”. It is a short road from legalising torture intended to gain information to accepting torture as a legitimate weapon and for all sorts of purposes. The “intellectual respectability” conferred by the academy is essential for that enterprise. Thus, since Alan Dershowitz’s carefully constructed proposal to introduce torture warrants is both the most prominent and the most sophisticated of today’s attempts to make torture respectable, it is his proposal we need to focus on.\r\n\r\nIn the Introduction, I say something about both the intellectual and the political contexts of the so-called ticking bomb scenario that is the basis of these proposals. In chapter two I argue that the “ticking bomb” scenario remains in crucial respects a fantasy; and that the grounds it is said to offer for justifying interrogational torture so as to avoid a putative catastrophe are spurious. In chapter three I argue that, whatever you think of those arguments, the consequences of legalising interrogational torture, and thus institutionalising it, would be so disastrous as to outweigh any such catastrophes anyway. Finally, in chapter four, I draw together what the details of my argument imply about torture in general and interrogational torture in particular; and about why any even semi-decent society must abhor torture -– in all circumstances, always, everywhere.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brecher, Bob"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85570,"sim:weight":0.294597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.287459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27048,"sim:weight":0.272518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764201,"sim:weight":0.267531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.260668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162815,"sim:weight":0.247195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48320,"sim:weight":0.240089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43649,"sim:weight":0.240007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.239616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387392,"sim:weight":0.23845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.237634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382971,"sim:weight":0.235298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46605,"sim:weight":0.234274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44768,"sim:weight":0.232128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162456,"sim:weight":0.232047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84762,"sim:weight":0.230357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.228094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146098,"sim:weight":0.226821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85275,"sim:weight":0.225382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85872,"sim:weight":0.222673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Proceeding by way of a detailed discussion of Philip Selznick’s definitive ‘Social Justice: a Communitarian Perspective’-- in which he seeks  ‘to reaffirm, and to clarify if I can, the communitarian commitment to social justice’ -- I show that rooted in the particular as communitarianism is, it cannot but reflect the values, beliefs and attitudes of the particular “community” in which it is variously found. Selznick\u0027s communitarianism, like any other, offers itself as a complement to, as well as a correction of, liberal principles: it could not do otherwise, since the institutional frameworks within which its values are to be realized are those of the modern nation-state and market econonmy.

Having considered the possible bases of appeals to \"human nature\" as a starting-point for political claims, I argue that, unless we already have a pre-existent non- or anti-humanist commitment, the movement in appeals to \"human nature\" is from our philosophical/political commitment to our view of it. But since that is precisely what the call for a pre-political humanism opposes, it founders on two difficulties. First, in what sense might a humanism – a commitment to humanity and a confidence in humanity’s capacity to improve its state – be ‘pre-political’at all? Second, since no humanism can be founded on some purely factual conception of what human beings are, since in that case no normative recommendations could be drawn from that conception, the ‘pre-political’ has to be understood as ‘non-normative\u0027. But how could it be? What other normative conception than a political one of what human beings are could there be? Precisely to the extent that we have a conception of our species at all, we are already a political species. To distinguish, for example, between ‘human being’ and ‘person’ – between ourselves as members of a specific biological species and ourselves as moral and political beings – is to imply a notion of people as some sort of moral-political beings, even if that sort remains (as yet) unspecified. So if by a ‘pre-political’ humanism is intended a humanism which is non-political, then it cannot be a humanism at all.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brecher, Bob"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":73335,"sim:weight":0.32005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187800,"sim:weight":0.312476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154444,"sim:weight":0.300183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43493,"sim:weight":0.279191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47158,"sim:weight":0.273036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43261,"sim:weight":0.270189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154452,"sim:weight":0.266788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145179,"sim:weight":0.266087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44768,"sim:weight":0.259133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.259085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734385,"sim:weight":0.258466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.254835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187623,"sim:weight":0.25475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85275,"sim:weight":0.254145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48384,"sim:weight":0.254019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146098,"sim:weight":0.253561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48320,"sim:weight":0.251304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47208,"sim:weight":0.249024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187758,"sim:weight":0.242204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176841,"sim:weight":0.241174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":5222758,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Autobiographical memory biases in social anxiety","bibo:abstract":"Individuals with social anxiety preferentially attend to threatening social information during and following social events. As such, cognitive models predict that social anxiety should be associated with biases in the recall of social events. However, initial experimental studies examining this assumption either failed to find such biases or found only weak evidence for an autobiographical memory bias. The current review examines an emerging line of evidence offering support for the role of an autobiographical memory bias in the development and maintenance of social anxiety. The review begins by examining current theoretical approaches to autobiographical memory before looking at empirical studies that have examined differences between socially anxious and non-anxious individuals in the recall of autobiographical memories. Specific memory biases include properties of social-threat memories, the imagery associated with these memories, and the cognitive processing styles that have been found to either facilitate or inhibit the recall of emotional memories. Limitations in methodologies used to study retrieval of memories and the implications of findings for future research are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morgan, Julie"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269342,"sim:weight":0.58779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779682,"sim:weight":0.481126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772993,"sim:weight":0.434415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778840,"sim:weight":0.33597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103125,"sim:weight":0.312822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22707,"sim:weight":0.282001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761126,"sim:weight":0.281401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.273518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46573,"sim:weight":0.267213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767834,"sim:weight":0.264114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9052696,"sim:weight":0.258744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387247,"sim:weight":0.250416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.246425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43866,"sim:weight":0.245685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43210,"sim:weight":0.242958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.233405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.233405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.232983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.222689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101596,"sim:weight":0.21882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In 1984, Andy Grundberg noted such a shift starting to occur specifically within documentary practice, ‘…towards recording the “I” instead of the “Other”, centering itself on what the photographer’s life is rather than on what it is not…’.  This exhibition features several prominent contemporary practitioners who are cleverly redressing this balance by merging direct encounters with the ‘Other’ into forms of self-exploration, self-revelation and subtle autobiography, equally emphasising what is in front of the camera – the ‘Other’ – and what is behind it – the ‘I’.\r\n\r\nALEC SOTH drew the attention of art world with his first book, Sleeping by the Mississippi, published by Steidl in 2004. His inclusion in the 2004 Whitney Biennial accelerated his growing reputation, and an invitation to join Magnum Photos followed shortly thereafter. Most recently, Soth had his first major museum retrospective – ‘From Here to There’ – at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 2010-11, which was accompanied by a conceptually intricate catalogue of the same name (Hatje Cantz, 2010). Soth is also a publisher, and has utilized his imprint, Little Brown Mushroom, to produce small editions of highly personal books and magazines. His own new book, Broken Manual, published by Steidl in 2011, was voted ‘Best Book’ at the Kassel Photobook Festival 2011, and also resulted in a documentary film about him, aptly entitled Somewhere to Disappear.\r\n\r\nWASSINKLUNDGREN is a partnership between Thijs groot Wassink and Ruben Lundgren, which began in 2005 after they both graduated from the Utrecht School of Arts. Through collaboration, they make work often described as conceptual documentary photography. In 2007 they published Empty Bottles, which won the prestigious Prix du Livre for Best Contemporary Photobook at the Rencontres d’Arles Photofestival, was nominated by Thomas Weski as ‘Best Photography Book of 2007-8 at the Kasseler Fotoforum, and was selected by Martin Parr for exhibition at the New York Photo Festival 2008. Other publications include Hans Kemna: Catalogue (2008), the booklet Don’t Smile Now… Save it for Later! (2008), and most recently, Tokyo Tokyo (2010). Wassink lives in London, where he recently finished an MA in Fine Art at Central Saint Martins. Lundgren lives in Beijing, where he recently finished an MA at the Central Academy of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nVIVIANE SASSEN was born in Amsterdam in 1972, and spent her early childhood in Kenya. In 1997, she received her MA in Fine Arts from the Royal Academy in Arnhem. Since then she has found great success as a fashion photographer, publishing work in avant-garde fashion magazines, and has established a unique visual vocabulary all her own. Her aesthetic combines a sense of childhood memory, where scenes are crystallized and highly saturated with color and shadow, with a photographer’s sensitivity to the body and surface. In 2008, she published Flamboya (Contrasto) to high acclaim, and her work has since been exhibited at FOAM (Amsterdam), Danziger Projects (New York), and currently as part of the Museum of Modern Art’s series, ‘New Photography 2011’ (28th Sept. 2011 – 16th Jan. 2012).","bibo:AuthorList":["Schuman, Aaron","Soth, Alec","Wassink, Thijs","Lundgren, Ruben","Sassen, Viviane"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.335487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.335115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44963,"sim:weight":0.322342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771724,"sim:weight":0.318492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.316416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43037,"sim:weight":0.315553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.311511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.305781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84996,"sim:weight":0.30572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.303445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.302012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145750,"sim:weight":0.301051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46611,"sim:weight":0.29705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634681,"sim:weight":0.295858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383598,"sim:weight":0.290682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051969,"sim:weight":0.287436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.286775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.286297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154386,"sim:weight":0.285794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930822,"sim:weight":0.283165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":5222768,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Article","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Keeping an eye on the truth: pupil size, recognition memory and malingering","bibo:abstract":"Background: Estimates of the incidence of malingering in patient populations vary from 1 to 12%, rising to ∼25% in patients seeking financial compensation. Malingering is particularly difficult to detect when patients feign poor performance on neuropsychological tests (see Hutchinson, 2001). One strategy to detect malingering has been to identify psychophysiological markers associated with deception. Tardif, Barry, Fox and Johnstone (2000) used electroencephalogram (EEG) recording to measure event related potentials (ERPs) during a standard recognition memory test. Previous research has documented an ERP “old/new effect” – late positive parietal ERPs are larger when participants view old, learned words compared to new words during recognition. Tardif et al. reasoned that if this effect is not under conscious control, then it should be equally detectable in people feigning amnesia as in participants performing to their best ability. As predicted, they found no difference in the magnitude and topography of the old/new ERP effect between participants who were asked to feign amnesia whilst performing the test and those asked to perform to their best ability. Whilst this approach shows some promise, EEG is comparatively time consuming and expensive. Previous research has shown that during recognition memory tests, participants\u0027 pupils dilate more when they view old items compared to new items (Otero, Weeks, and Hutton, 2006; Vo et al., 2008). This pupil “old/new effect” may present a simpler means by which to establish whether participants are feigning amnesia.\r\nMethod: We used video-based oculography to compare changes in pupil size during a recognition memory test when participants were given standard recognition memory instructions, instructions to feign amnesia and instructions to report all items as new. Due to constant fluctuation in pupil size over time, and variation between individuals, a pupil dilation ratio (PDR) was calculated that represented the maximum pupil size during the trial as a proportion of the maximum during baseline.\r\nResults: Participants\u0027 pupils dilated more to old items compared to new items under all three instruction conditions (F(1.25) \u003d 47.02, MSE \u0026lt; 0.001, p \u0026lt; .001, ηp2 \u003d .65). There were no significant differences between baseline pupil size (F(1.63,40.76) \u003d 1.90, p \u003d .17, ns).\r\nConclusions: The finding that under standard recognition memory instructions, participants\u0027 relative increase in pupil size is greater when they view old items compared to new items replicates previous research documenting the pupil old/new effect. That the effect persists, even when participants give erroneous responses during recognition, suggests that the “pupil old/new effect” is not under conscious control and may therefore have potential use in clinical settings as a simple means with which to detect whether patients are feigning amnesia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heaver, Becky","Hutton, Sam B."],"dc:date":"2010-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222574,"sim:weight":0.779361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768884,"sim:weight":0.671398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98622,"sim:weight":0.317502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99071,"sim:weight":0.284384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99474,"sim:weight":0.251806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.247203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643975,"sim:weight":0.238292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101416,"sim:weight":0.228036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146056,"sim:weight":0.213461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.205901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.202795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26616,"sim:weight":0.202327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763966,"sim:weight":0.197196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145489,"sim:weight":0.191631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.187931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43394,"sim:weight":0.186583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.181564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.181564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.180904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.180035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Despite our survival of the Great Depression, as well as the rest of the twentieth century, similar symptoms of waste and selfishness have recurred, and once again we fi nd ourselves in an age that is seemingly threatened with “imminent collapse.” \r\n\r\nThe exhibition Whatever Was Splendid explores the parallels that exist—both in America and in photography—between our own time and that of Evans, and the enduring power of American Photographs as discerned through contemporary U.S. photographic practice.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the first chapter of American Photographs evidences the diversity and range of Evans’ photographic vision. Kirstein noted that Evans “elevat[ed] the casual, the everyday and the literal into specific, permanent symbols,\" and it is within this chapter where many of Evans’ American “symbols” reside—laborers, soldiers, and citizens of the city streets; barbershops, farm stands and clapboard shotgun shacks; main streets, civic statues, and grandiose boardinghouse facades; cars, cars, and more cars, roaming freely, sitting in neat rows, or lying abandoned by the side of the road; ubiquitous advertisements and torn billboards; playbills and political placards; movie posters, cryptic graffiti, and meticulously hand-painted storefront signs; the ghettos, the poor, the homeless, and the flood refugees; the god-fearing family, the loving couple, the man in the crowd, and the lonely girl looking out to sea; and so on. This profoundly ambitious and extensive collection of images—found within just the first fifty pages of Evans’s book—not only serves as a document of America in Evans’ time, but also prophetically catalogues a landscape, character, cultural experience, and visual vocabulary that remain both poignant and familiar within the country to this day. And in particular, this index bears an uncanny resemblance to the America described and preserved within photography since Evans, including that of today’s most exciting, perceptive, and original practitioners.\r\n\r\nAt its heart, Whatever Was Splendid is centrally informed by the legacy of American Photographs, and by Evans’ vital contributions to the nation’s photographic language and traditions. That said, it is by no means intended as a nostalgic update or sentimental plea for photography (or, for that matter, America) to return to its past. As much as Evans’ precedent has provided both the inspiration and reinforcing framework for this exhibition, Whatever Was Splendid is first and foremost the manifestation of the intelligence, ingenuity, and multiplicity of voices and visions that can be found within current U.S. photographic practice. Yet consciously or not, all the photographers represented here have, in their own distinct ways, expanded upon many of the themes, strategies, clues, symbols, “certain sights, [and] certain relics of American civilization past or present”  first glimpsed in American Photographs.\r\n\r\nThey all inherently possess a somewhat familiar “burrowing eye,” and share a determination to record, testify, and salvage what they can of their own precarious age for its survivors. And just like Evans, they have both reinvigorated American photography and redefined their country—conceptually, aesthetically, culturally, politically, historically, photographically, and so on—within very contemporary terms, celebrating both the United States and its photography, as Kirstein put it, “with all [its] clear, hideous and beautiful detail, [its] open insanity and pitiful grandeur.”","bibo:AuthorList":["Schuman, Aaron"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.325701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.315699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.307494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.293702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43380,"sim:weight":0.293668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.270651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.270108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.266872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.262295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48370,"sim:weight":0.256305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.255214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44804,"sim:weight":0.253894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145840,"sim:weight":0.253391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.251272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45831,"sim:weight":0.251009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771816,"sim:weight":0.250059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.245876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.241572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.240165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.239279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":5222775,"ep:Repository":122,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Evidence focused social care: on target or off-side?","bibo:abstract":"As contentions continue to engulf the evidence-based practice (EBP) debate within social care, consensus seems to be gravitating towards the softer term of ‘evidence-aware’ practice, although there is as yet no definitive concept on the horizon. Set against a back-drop of competing ideologies, heavily influenced by the natural sciences, what is at stake is the essence of social work: there is a real danger that social work practice be reduced to mere base elements, which seek to eliminate all notions of uncertainly, so essential and endemic to our social world; a characteristic of our very being. Underlying the surface arguments that an evidence-focused approach can realise better practice, are questions of power and control. In exploring the current position of EBP within UK social care, this paper argues that as an interpersonal profession, operating within the complexities of the social world, social work would be better suited to pursue an inclusive ‘knowledge-aware’ approach to practice, which may allow the profession to move beyond the restrictive and limiting polemics that surround it. Deliverance of a deserving future will require a brave and frank acceptance of our own fallibility, together with an openness which allows the profession to harness its key values.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dore, Ian J."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The article argues that at the heart of our current ecological crisis are fundamental problems of dependency and vulnerability, resulting for many in an ambivalent attachment to nature. Understanding the complex ways in which humans react to intimacy as a result of early attachment is central to the project of ecopsychology and the ways in which people can help understand\r\nand shift the nature of their relationships, both to the planet and with each other. The article concludes by looking at evidence for a securely attached “ecological self” and the potential for developmental models to promote this.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jordan, Martin"],"dc:date":"2009-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Martin Jordan reviews the book from across the Atlantic in England and suggests that the book could have attended to a more inclusive perspective. As a scholar and practitioner he is able to emphasize certain essays and how they make a contribution to the work he is doing.

This assumed a wide variety of forms, including the remodelling of bomb-damaged city centres and urban spaces with improved standards of signage and street furniture, a commitment to social housing and everyday domestic furnishings and fittings, the proliferation of New Towns, the building of new schools and universities in tandem with the forging of new educational policies, and the design of public transport systems on land, air and sea.  It is an evaluation of many of these material embodiments of the Welfare State that this chapter seeks to address, drawing on a wide range of contemporary and archival sources.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, as is further discussed, the postwar decades revealed a gradual shift away from what was essentially a shared vision of a well-planned, democratic and material embodiment of the values of the Welfare State, the principles of which largely continued under the 1950s Conservative governments of Churchill, Eden and Macmillan and succeeding Labour and Conservative Governments in the 1960s and 1970s.  However, Prime Minister Thatcher, three years after her Conservative Government had been elected in 1979, extolled the benefits of free enterprise and the primacy of the individual in her opening speech to an Information Technology Conference at the Barbican Centre, London. She declared that: “The first ingredient of our approach is a passionate belief in the virtues of free enterprise and individual endeavour. Innovation and initiative cannot flourish if they are smothered by a state that wants to control everything. We shall not blaze again the trail that Brunel, Morris and Marconi found, if we consign their successors to the consensus of committees and excessive and irksome regulation.” Such an approach clearly sounded the death-knell of the public facing moral didacticism of preceding decades.\r\n\r\nToday, architects, designers and others in the creative and cultural sectors face very different challenges to those of their 1940s counterparts although they share the impact of economic crisis. However, in stark contrast to the reconstruction era that proffered many opportunities for state and public-funded commissions, the 2010s have seen the role of the state and centralized government challenged by the concept of ‘Big Society’. This, or so it is argued by Conservative politicians, gives individuals and communities more control over their destinies, a line of thought strongly reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher’s critique of the ‘nanny’ State in the 1980s and an anathema to the ‘visions’ postwar architects of the Welfare State.","bibo:AuthorList":["Woodham, Jonathan M","BREWARD, C","WOODS, G"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Between its foundation in 1946 and its break up in the political turmoil of the early 1990s, ISKRA also played a highly significant part in the post war economic development of Yugoslavia, one of the most ’progressive,’ although non-aligned, of European communist countries.\r\n\r\nAn important aspect of ‘re-aligning’ ISKRA and Slovenian design was to test the validity of the claims of the organizers of the ISKRA: 1946-90, Non-Aligned Design exhibition (Architecture Museum Ljubljana, 2009) that, as a high profile manufacturer and successful design networker and exporter, historians of design in Europe and beyond have ignored it.  In fact, in support of this assertion, there is a considerable amount of primary material outside Yugoslavia in the University of Brighton’s Design Archives holdings, most notably the Design Council Archive and the Archives of the International Council of Graphic Design Associations (ICOGRADA) and International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (ISCID), all of which contain useful material relating to Yugoslavian and Slovenian design between 1945 and the early 1990s, particularly in respect of the “Golden Age” of Slovenian design between 1960 and 1985.\r\n\r\nThis essay addresses the relative absence of Yugoslavian, and in this particular case Slovenian, design from the world map of design history.  The difficulties of accessing and interpreting primary documentation were considerable as there are less than 2.5 million Slovenian speakers in the world, less than 60 years since the country’s relatively small design community became a cohesive body and design education is still emerging in terms of its economic, social and cultural influence; design history as an academic discipline is still in its infancy.  Issues of language accessibility may partly explain which Slovenian design has received a lesser profile than the communist aligned countries, particularly the former German Democratic Republic which has been the subject of rigorous and revealing research and publication over more recent years.","bibo:AuthorList":["Woodham, Jonathan M"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Adopting a discursive approach to formations of ‘art’ and ‘artistry’, I explore three aspects of the series. First, the Silent Hill game-texts are examined as evoking formal devices of art cinema: realism, ambiguity, psychological complexity, self-reflexivity. Next the games’ advertising is considered as emphasising these qualities, privileging narratological over ludological gaming aspects, and mobilising avant-garde visual strategies. Finally the games’ representation in the documentary ‘The Making of Silent Hill 2’ (MoSH2) is discussed as aligning the series with notions of authorship.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kirkland, Ewan"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Noting the dominance of traditional male characters and masculine themes within the video-game medium, the Silent Hill franchise is seen as deviating from this assured, aggressive, and unexamined machismo. The series\u0027 protagonists are instead nondescript, flawed, domesticated men—unstable, angst-ridden, and unreliable in a manner that interrogates the dominant mode of masculine gameplay. The problematic nature of video-game interactivity and identity, the extent to which gameplay can exist independent of playable protagonists, and the gendering of video-game goals and objectives are considered. Despite conforming to certain masculine activities—fighting, collecting weaponry, exploring and dominating space—Silent Hill complicates such aspects through the game avatars\u0027 unremarkable abilities, limiting supplies, frantic combat styles, frustrating spatial progress, experiences of entrapment, and a pervading sense of helplessness, exemplified by the games\u0027 often deterministic linear structures. Overall, this article argues that the games encourage critical distance from the male game characters, the rescue missions they attempt and often fail, the monstrous images of femininity they imagine, and the voyeuristic practices in which they engage.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kirkland, Ewan"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Foo, Priest writes, performed an illusion in which he produced a large bowl of water from under an empty cloth; logically, the only place that the magician could conceal the bowl was beneath his cape, and yet this was clearly impossible for ‘it was obvious to everyone that Ching Ling Foo was physically frail, shuffling painfully through his routine’.   In fact Foo had adopted the gait in order to conceal the enigma—that the bowl was indeed hidden beneath his cape, and that the magician himself was a man of great physical strength and fitness.  He was therefore condemned always to walk in this fashion, performing or otherwise, solely in order to maintain the deception necessary to execute the trick. \r\n\tIn this paper I examine the concept of the artist-performer as a kind of border prospector, and I suggest that the counter-intuitive inversion of reality represented by Ching Ling Foo’s ‘shuffling gait’ underpins the perverse logics of both magic and art, being emblematic of the ways in which they often conceal and reveal meaning.  In Performing Dark Arts Michael Mangan puts forward the case for the magician as someone who is ‘constantly engaged in boundary work: […] he brings us up against the limits of a culture’s beliefs and knowledge of its habitual ways of understanding the world’.   For Mangan, the magician is a border prospector par excellence, trading on contemporary beliefs or superstitions in order to test or subvert them.  The 19th century French magician Robert-Houdin had transformed the status of the stage illusionist when he declared: ‘A conjuror […] is an actor playing the part of a magician’, and Mangan extrapolates this position towards a more complex definition of acting ; he cites performance theorist Marvin Carlson who (pace Schechner) argued that, while performing, the performer ‘is not herself (because of the operations of illusion), but she is also not not herself (because of the operations of reality).  Performer and audience alike operate in a world of double consciousness’. \r\nEmploying ideas about play (in particular Alfred Gell’s suggestion that play orients the agent towards a ‘magic standard’), and Victor Turner’s conception of the ‘liminoid’—a ludic zone or in-between state, which permeates not just art, but everyday life—I explore these ideas through the work of artists including Martin Creed, Mark Leckey, and Marcus Coates, as well as magician-performers such as Tommy Cooper and Derren Brown.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gilhooly, Jonathan"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103251,"sim:weight":0.653905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A reassessment","bibo:abstract":"For a few years in the 1980s, Andrea Dworkin’s Pornography: Men Possessing Women appeared to have changed the intellectual landscape – as well as some people’s lives. Pornography, she argued, not only constitutes violence against women; it constitutes also the main conduit for such violence, of which rape is at once the prime example and the central image. In short, it is patriarchy’s most powerful weapon. Given that, feminists’ single most important task is to deal with pornography. By the early 1990s, however, the consensus had become that her project was a diversion, both politically and intellectually. Today, who would argue that pornography is a crucial political issue?\r\n\r\nI shall argue that Dworkin has in fact a great deal to teach us – perhaps even more today, as we are going through the neo-liberal revolution, than thirty years ago. Her argument is not a causal one, despite in places reading as if it were. The legal route she chose as the ground on which to fight may well be a dead end, but that does nothing to undermine the force of her analysis. Nor does the fact that she makes arguments that might not be recognized as professionally philosophical or social scientific undermine their substantive force. It may even be that pornography itself is not the sole key she thought it was to understanding and dealing with political realities; but even if that were so, the form of her analysis, far from rhetorical and/or fallacious, is exactly what is needed to counter the depredations of neo-liberal “common sense”. That she herself found it difficult to find a language beyond that of liberalism to express her argument is no reason either for ignoring or misinterpreting it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brecher, Bob","Marway, H.","Widdows, H."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.417001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710015,"sim:weight":0.407966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.38049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352208,"sim:weight":0.377668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383352,"sim:weight":0.370167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46611,"sim:weight":0.361832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382095,"sim:weight":0.350435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48296,"sim:weight":0.3502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.35017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383655,"sim:weight":0.348624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.335631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101412,"sim:weight":0.326573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45520,"sim:weight":0.324242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47182,"sim:weight":0.321971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.321103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108548,"sim:weight":0.318352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.31325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709957,"sim:weight":0.312768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.305916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.302251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Organised around the ludic rheme, \u0027Twice the Va Va Voom\u0027, and the critical valorisation, \u0027French car, British designers\u0027, the advertising campaign, launched in 2005, elaborates a double-code that sets up the idea of the \u0027country-of-origin\u0027 as a contest, pitting Britain, in the guise of Ben, against France, in the guise of Sophie. As such, the commercial identity of the car is performatively imbricated, scene-by-scene, with cultural phenomena from both France and Britain - engineering, food, literature, and romance. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, I deal with the tension between sameness and difference in Anglo-French relations that the verbal and visual rhetoric of the publicity connotes in the context of the \u0027entente cordiale\u0027. I take into account the way the ad campaign simultaneously maintains and deconstructs the cultural, social and historical stereotypes that exist on the ‘outside’, addressing sex and gender identities, white nationalism and white foreignness, and the racial blind spots of the advertisement in comparison to the preceding \u0027Va Va Voom\u0027 campaign, which starred the black footballer Thierry Henry. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, as we observe Ben and Sophie driving their respective Clios around London and Paris in the television advertisement, and the conjunction of London and Paris signified in the poster, I argue the city is objectified as a kind of meeting point or passage for the negotiation of new social relations and networks that enunciate the transition from political to commercial globalism in the Single European Market. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research paper was originally delivered as a keynote address for the Design History Society Annual Conference, ‘Writing Design - Process: Object: Discourse: Translation’ at the University of Hertfordshire, 3-5 September 2009.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jobling, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The project involves running two writing retreats for lecturers from the University of Brighton and the University of Sussex. We explain how we are using methods adopted on a creative writing module at the University of Brighton, to help academic staff develop the confidence, motivation and inspiration to write, and to guide them to adopt effective writing habits. \r\n\r\nWriting and publishing are increasingly crucial to the development of a successful academic career. However, academics typically receive little guidance and support on how to establish and maintain this strand of their job. Any advice that does exist tends to focus on the technical and practical aspects of writing for scholarly publication. This often makes writing seem a challenge to be endured for the sake of one’s career rather than enjoyed and used for vocational and personal development. Instead of gaining a sense of achievement and pride from their writing, academics often view writing as an unwanted pressure, and experience the process of writing as demoralising and damaging to self-confidence.  \r\n\r\nIn this paper we briefly outline the format of our writing retreats and the ethos behind their design. We discuss the relationship we perceive between creativity and learning, and the false divide we often see between ‘the academic and ‘the creative’. We end the paper by offering a writing exercise – Laudation Poem – as an example of the work that our retreat participants are expected to undertake.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moriarty, J.","Antoniou, M."],"dc:date":"2007-01-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.294729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85785,"sim:weight":0.257907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.248889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3179,"sim:weight":0.248172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.241974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.241719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10755,"sim:weight":0.239543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53021,"sim:weight":0.23943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.238952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341327,"sim:weight":0.232837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.2254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222579,"sim:weight":0.220669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47006,"sim:weight":0.213344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193190,"sim:weight":0.212828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155556,"sim:weight":0.210252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.20512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.204689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53693,"sim:weight":0.203524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162159,"sim:weight":0.203407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78564,"sim:weight":0.202079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At night motorways come into being visually through their own illumination, rendering the surrounding landscape visible only by degrees.

The project aims to elicit and nurture greater understandings of the value of material narratives as a mediator of material ethics and facilitator of prolonged user engagements. Having formed prototype shoes and material narratives made from waste and new hybrid materials, the project methodology (outlined below) will use a public and industrial engagement processes via exhibition to gather data. The project engages a broad range of ‘materialists’, from sustainable craftspeople, industrial waste recyclers, bio-chemists and product manufacturers to end users. \r\n\r\nResearch Questions\r\nCentral research questions of the project are:\r\n\r\n•\tbeyond the ‘inert’, industrial recycling of materials, can material design and manufacturing strategies be formed that enable ‘by-product’ and waste materials to successfully contain, enhance and convey eloquent material narratives and meaning, as a route to achieving higher consumer ‘value’ and demand for more sustainable materials and products?\r\n•\tcan objects and by-product materials be purposefully designed and fabricated to promote user engagement with materiality (matter-reality) and facilitate greater consumer understanding, evaluation and discernment of complex issues of material culture and ethics?\r\n•\tcan this process be transferable and applied industrially and can it further authenticate products and make them relevant for the demands of 21st century consumers and contexts? \r\n\r\nAims and objectives to:\r\n\r\n•\tform an extensive body of documented research that includes the invention of new physical materials formed from ‘by-products’ resulting in the formation of 10 pairs of shoes as ‘object essays’, the mapping of critically linked cultures of ‘our made world’, public and industrial engagement events and evaluation data, disseminated via exhibition(s), publication, online media, conference papers and press publications  \r\n•\tarm the recycling, material manufacturing and design industries with models for engendering meaning into everyday objects and materials, that promote better consumer behaviours, foster appreciation and instil value for products formed from by-product materials\r\n•\tdevise and deploy accessible means of engagement and modes of communication in the presentation of complex and critical aspects of physical science and material culture to public, industrial and creative audiences\r\n•\timplement novel approaches to user centred design and material practices in the formation of potent object and material typologies and product proposals\r\n•\tidentify and articulate useable strategies and transferable methods that address the manifold concerns of resource consumption, fabrication and use celebrate and exemplify craft, design and materials practice as central threads within the inter-woven fabric of a more sustainable material culture\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\n\r\nThe formation of 10 pairs of shoes and 10 material narratives: The project is not about shoe design per say, but employs the popular and cultural iconography of shoes as a vehicle to carry the content in an accessible and measurable way to public and industrial design audiences, whilst providing rudimentary function and ‘connection’ to the user and their activity. The shoes present distinctly different by-product typologies to enable the exploration and evaluation of the impact of each material methodology and design as a potential tool for public engagement, education, communication and industrial application. \r\n\r\nThe project uses 10 human subjects for whom the shoes are created. Central, and seminal, to the consideration of the shoe and the subject is the unique relational notion of the material substance formed from by-products created by the user. Rather than seeing these as waste, this project reveals these by-products as potentially having enriched embodied histories, stories, meanings and experiences held within their materiality. These include the use of human tissue such as breast-milk and synthetic skin technologies, oceanic waste, carbon, consumable waste and animal hair.  The ‘processing’ of these material substances into shoes will unravel and expose essential elements that instill meaning, integrity and value within creation and consumption chains and cycles, that typically lie hidden through one’s life, material and even spiritual existence. \r\n\r\nThe methodology directs a process of narrative production, generating focused material in the form of experiments, new materials, objects, processes, samples, case studies, interviews and transcripts that form the ‘stories’ as a medium for dissemination. By researching and documenting the story of how each pair of shoes is realised as a product, ‘Sole-Searching’ will investigate, map and explicate the relationships and connections between the object and the subject, as facilitated by the material and the maker. This exercise will demonstrate the potential and significance of the processing and design of the ‘by-product’ materials within this framework in establishing meaningful, valuable and authentic engagements in otherwise ‘inert’ product and material interactions. In doing so, the methodology will simultaneously generate novel, transferable models whilst demonstrating the value of craft, design and material practices in the mediation and reconciliation of unresolved and substantial issues of materiality and contemporary consumer culture.  \r\n\r\nThe project methodology functions to invigorate, unite and expose a community of practitioners, industries and cultures, around highly scrutinised and current areas of material culture. This timely project will deploy and compose a range of provocative debates and innovative media, facilitated by popular iconography and accessible formats to engage an ambitious range of audiences: academic, industrial, retail, creative and public alike.

Ellen Lupton 2011.\r\n\r\nThis major international exhibition explores how graphic design has broadened its reach dramatically over the past decade, expanding from a specialized profession to a widely deployed tool. With the rise of user-generated content and new creative software, along with innovations in publishing and distribution systems, people outside the field are mobilizing the techniques and processes of design to create and publish visual media. At the same time, designers are becoming producers: authors, publishers, instigators, and entrepreneurs employing their creative skills as makers of content and shapers of experiences.\r\n\r\nFeaturing work produced since 2000 in the most vital sectors of communication design, Graphic Design: Now in Production explores design-driven magazines, newspapers, books, and posters as well as branding programs for corporations, subcultures, and nations. It also showcases a series of developments over the past decade, such as the entrepreneurial nature of designer-produced goods; the renaissance in digital typeface design; the storytelling potential of titling sequences for film and television; and the transformation of raw data into compelling information narratives.\r\n\r\nGraphic Design: Now in Production is the largest museum exhibition on the subject since the Walker’s seminal 1989 exhibition Graphic Design in America: A Visual Language History, and the Cooper-Hewitt’s 1996 comprehensive survey, Mixing Messages: Graphic Design in Contemporary Culture.

Uncanny: Surrealism and Graphic Design curated by Rick Poynor at the Moravian Gallery in Brno was part of the 24th International Biennial of Graphic Design -23 June to 24 October 2010, and travelled to the Kunsthal Museum, Rotterdam, Netherlands - 24 September to 4 December 2011\r\n\r\n\r\nUncanny: Surrealism and Graphic Design uncovers the presence of an alternative tradition in graphic design.\r\n\r\nThe Surrealist movement of the 1920s and 1930s focused on literature, painting, photography and the object, and the Surrealists\u0027 publishing activities provided only hints of what a fully conceived Surrealist graphic design or typography might look like. Many of the most suggestive early examples came from Czechoslovakia, where Surrealism would become a lasting influence. Subsequently, Surrealist ideas and images had a profound impact on image-makers in every sphere of art and design, and by the 1960s the effects of Surrealism were widely felt in international graphic communication. Uncanny traces this intermittent line of development up to the present. Work showing a strong debt to Surrealism emerges only when a designer appears who is attuned to this way of thinking, dreaming and imagining. Most graphic design conforms to an underlying grid, a sense of structure and professional good taste, which brings order but also imposes limits. The images and designs in Uncanny break free from these bureaucratic restrictions and follow the impulses of a wayward, subjective, dreamlike logic to arrive at their own kind of equilibrium and form. They show that graphic design, too, can sometimes be a place to encounter the strange, the fantastical and the uncanny, to rediscover our lost sense of mystery, and to experience the convulsive beauty and capacity for enchantment and wonder that the Surrealists called \"the marvellous\".","bibo:AuthorList":["Poynor, Rick"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9051967,"sim:weight":0.305375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.243551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.21245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771698,"sim:weight":0.211439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.194573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.187401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931320,"sim:weight":0.181556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.180096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.178427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105058,"sim:weight":0.173444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103251,"sim:weight":0.167958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43037,"sim:weight":0.166072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051960,"sim:weight":0.16442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43380,"sim:weight":0.164365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103424,"sim:weight":0.162367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.160424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771695,"sim:weight":0.158599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585863,"sim:weight":0.155992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352132,"sim:weight":0.155406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223937,"sim:weight":0.154521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The fair opened to the public on June 1, 2000 and ran five months, ending on October 31.

Graham Rawle, invited as a keynote speaker, delivered a lecture on how he created his illustrated reinterpretation of L. Frank Baum\u0027s original 1900 classic tale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In my books I’d never illustrated anyone else’s text before, but I was particularly drawn to The Wizard of Oz. It’s a wonderful story – a deceptively simple tale that has incredible psychological depth so it works on a number of levels. Dorothy’s journey is really about a personality that’s trying to become complete. At its core it holds an important life lesson: that the things we yearn for or the qualities we think we lack are already a part of us, but we invariably need to go on the journey to make this discovery. \r\nThe original story is richly populated with strange and wonderful characters not featured in the classic 1939 film: the Dainty China people, ornament-size folk made from porcelain who are prone to breakages, and the Hammer Heads, armless fighters with extendable necks and hard, flat heads. These have rarely, if ever, been depicted before so it was a great opportunity to bring them to life, as well as reinterpreting the more familiar characters.There are extra scenes, as well as back story that reveals the origin of the Winged Monkeys, how the Tin Woodman came to be made of tin, and how the Emerald City only appears green because its inhabitants are made to wear green tinted spectacles.\r\nI’ve been faithful to the original text, but my own way of thinking inevitably comes through. In my version, Dorothy’s dog Toto is a push-along toy on wheels. It may seem like a glib decision, but it tells us something about Dorothy’s view of reality. And it’s funny, because in the book, he doesn’t really do anything. When Toto is ready to go to sleep, they just tip him over on his side.”","bibo:AuthorList":["Graham , Rawle"],"dc:date":"2008-11-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1344239,"sim:weight":0.319485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710663,"sim:weight":0.31579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154412,"sim:weight":0.306746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23659,"sim:weight":0.292389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44084,"sim:weight":0.288653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.280162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9559,"sim:weight":0.278871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43311,"sim:weight":0.277735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44568,"sim:weight":0.276846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.271987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12326,"sim:weight":0.270598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769036,"sim:weight":0.27036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929811,"sim:weight":0.267939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.267693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.264944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99435,"sim:weight":0.264518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99288,"sim:weight":0.263341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710667,"sim:weight":0.262407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763965,"sim:weight":0.261809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45883,"sim:weight":0.26113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The implications of these tensions for how we might think of the family, I then propose, suggest that earlier critiques are worth revisiting for what they have to say about the family – whether in biological or in  social form – as a structure of ownership.

So I approach the issue by analysing the extreme case where people such as Dershowitz, Posner and Walzer think torture is justified, the so-called ticking bomb scenario. And since the justification offered is always consequentialist - no one thinks that torture is in any way “good in itself” – I confine myself to consequentialist arguments. That is to say, I take the argument on its own terms, since any non-consequentialist objection to torture merely invites the response, ‘So much the worse for non-consequentialism’: if a moral theory insists that torture is wrong even if it would save thousands of lives that just shows how wrong the theory is . I focus only on the question of the moral justifiability of torture in the ‘ticking bomb’ case, and do not not ask whether, even if admittedly immoral, it should nonetheless be legalised (see Brecher, Torture and the Ticking Bomb, Wiley-Blackwell 2007)). \r\nMy main argument is in two parts: (1) the “ticking bomb” scenario falls apart when analysed; and (2), even if it did not, the likely consequences of permitting torture would be worse than the bomb’s going off. \r\nFinally I briefly consider a genuine case.\r\nFurther questions and readings are appended.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brecher, Bob","Jackson, Richard","Sinclair, Justin"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":986506,"sim:weight":0.353601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.239914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585867,"sim:weight":0.236512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.232193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":666399,"sim:weight":0.229874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586690,"sim:weight":0.227557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52539,"sim:weight":0.224002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73559,"sim:weight":0.221367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43959,"sim:weight":0.220109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27048,"sim:weight":0.218766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46372,"sim:weight":0.216194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734385,"sim:weight":0.212908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187644,"sim:weight":0.210972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764201,"sim:weight":0.209856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73335,"sim:weight":0.208677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":520381,"sim:weight":0.208424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146098,"sim:weight":0.208384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85872,"sim:weight":0.207878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108548,"sim:weight":0.20548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146042,"sim:weight":0.203817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thus, it offers an opportunity for looking at the achievements of Estonian design from a wider perspective and ultimately helps to explain the reasons and mechanisms behind the design solutions. Contemporary products, which are drawn from categories of furniture, electronics, computing, medical equipment and motoring, are exhibited alongside historic examples of innovation in technology and design, including Luterma waterproof plywood products and Minox mini-camera designed by Walter Zapp in 1936.\r\n \r\nThe exhibition which was the opening event of the Innovation Festival and the Design Night 2011, was curated by Ene Läkk.\r\n\r\n\r\nJüri Kermik, Chair from the series ÄKSI, 2002 (catalogue entry, p 64)\r\nThis series presents a blend of historical and contemporary.

ÄKSI represents its modern development. This chair is easy to manufacture and market as all details of the seat are straight and can be assembled only by means of bolts. All the diverse chairs from the ÄKSI series are made using rather extraordinary techniques, from sawing to entwining.

Recognized as one of the earliest and most influential online photography publications of its kind, SeeSaw Magazine serves as an important resource and research tool for the international photographic community.  Each issue features a selection of portfolios by both established and emerging artists, as well as photo-related essays, reviews and interviews with some of the medium’s most prominent practitioners (including Stephen Shore, John Baldessari, Paul Graham, Elinor Carucci, Alec Soth, Richard Misrach, Jem Southam, and more).  SeeSaw has both championed and helped to launch the careers of a number of photographers who have and continue to make valuable and lasting contributions to photography.  As an online publication, SeeSaw Magazine (and its entire archive) is available to the public, helping to make carefully considered and serious photography – as well as the dialogues that surround it, and the diverse subjects it may address – accessible to not only those with a keen interest and investment in contemporary photography, but anyone with internet access.  \r\n     In 2006, SeeSaw was selected for preservation by The British Library – in collaboration with the UK Web Archive Consortium – and continues to be archived regularly within their collection.

Suppose the sensors transmit this information to the cloud , continuously and unobtrusively. Suppose artificial intelligence in the cloud detects an anomaly. Suppose it tells your doctor: sighs of relief all round. But then suppose it tells an actuary, who tells your insurer, who tells your employer ... This is the world of pervasive adaptation. This Pervasive Day explores the potential and perils of daily living with pervasive adaptive computing. This is the result of saturating ourselves and our physical environment with sensors, cameras and devices, all connected to and inter-connected by global networks and computers, which can run increasingly intelligent machine-learning and data fusion algorithms on datasets that could be generated by the entire human population. This book takes as its unifying theme Ira Levin\u0027s 1970 science fiction novel This Perfect Day to expose both potential innovations and controversial social issues. It explores the science and technology of pervasive adaptation through a human-centred and socio-technical perspective within the cultural, ethical and legal context of contemporary life. It discusses how pervasive adaptation could provide the foundations for a new range of life-enhancing and planet-saving applications in health, sustainability and assistive living. On the other hand, with the recording, storage and processing of every action, emotion and thought, there also arise the possibilities for unwarranted surveillance, invasions of privacy, loss of civil liberties and commercial exploitation. This Pervasive Day is an insightful read for anyone concerned with the social impact of technology. Written by experienced technologists with a deep interest in computational intelligence, human-computer interaction and ambient systems, This Pervasive Day is a remarkable single source of reference a fusion of several technical disciplines that makes for a broad scope of investigation within the domains of pervasive computing. Unifying, informative and thought-provoking, This Pervasive Day takes its place as a landmark title that will challenge the perceptions of the technologists and policy-makers, the pragmatists and the theorists, the doers and the thought-leaders.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farrer, J.","Tillotson, J.","Ferscha, A.","Michael, K.","Mitcheson, P.","Serbedzijia, N.","Millan, J.","Whitaker, R.","Pitt, J.","Chavarriaga, R.","Dobson, S.","Quigley, A.","Colombo, G.","Allen, S.","Chorley, M.","Jefferies, J.","Michael, M.G.","Kernbach, S.","Wahren, K.","Pitt, Jeremy"],"dc:date":"2012-06-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":59347,"sim:weight":0.229923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.216042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.208492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.208007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151793,"sim:weight":0.207457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447898,"sim:weight":0.206351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.206341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44768,"sim:weight":0.205984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70404,"sim:weight":0.203894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.200476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880707,"sim:weight":0.19956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.199481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.19847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.197793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.197011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.194093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.193495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193234,"sim:weight":0.192868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.191529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.189852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For teaching restaurants, that are resource intensive facilities, with limited perceived value to University management, this could mean facing another wave of elimination similar to the one in the beginning of the new millennium.  The need to better enable research activity in such establishments is of paramount importance. Research activity has the potential to increase perceived value of training restaurants.  This paper presents the case study of an alternative approach that departs from the traditional teaching restaurant model design, and embraces research activity. Rather than focus on a teaching restaurant that enables research, the authors suggest the creation of research labs that may also accommodate food and beverage management teaching and learning.  By placing research at the forefront of the agenda, hospitality management academic teams can better secure food and beverage teaching facilities whilst  at the same time minimizing costs and maximizing research potential.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pantelidis, I.S.","Woodward, K."],"dc:date":"2012-05-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

With its intangible nature, hospitality finds it difficult to market its services. Past customer experiences are one of the best strategies that allows some quantification of the quality of the product. Social media and the growth of web 2.0 have enabled word of mouth to be shared amongst million of potential customers, one therefore can argue that electronic word of mouth (e-wom) has been the successor of the traditional word of mouth. However recent increase of m-commerce and the development of cheap and easy Smartphone technology suggests that the next stage of e-Wom is the use of video blogging as a method of sharing hospitality related experiences. The paper explores the thesis that word of video will be the natural evolution of e-wom in hospitality. It attempts to explore this by\r\ncomparing responses to a text review of a restaurant versus a video review of the same restaurant. Participants of the experiment are invited to either comment on the text review or the video review and the results from the two samples are compared. \r\n\r\nEarly findings suggest that hospitality users find pictures more useful and trustworthy followed by text reviews. Video blogging comes only third in terms of trustworthiness and usefulness. The findings are also validated by qualitative comments left by LinkedIn users.  Finally findings from this sample show a significance difference when it comes to hotel purchase intentions versus restaurant visit intentions, this finding may suggest that online reviews are less important for habitual purchases. The paper findings suggest implications for management who may chose to invest in platforms that facilitate the use of both ewom and wov as an integrated effort to the organisations marketing strategy. The research is limited by the small sample size and future research could consider a more in depth qualitative approach that allows for better understanding of the consumer perceptions of both ewom and wov. Having said that this paper delivers an original approach to word of mouth in hospitality. The authors suggest that although word of video appears to be at its infancy in hospitality, the potential implications for consumer behaviour research, (both for analysing the creation of WoV content by hospitality consumers and the consumption of such content) are great.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stampoulidou, Kiraki","Pantelidis, I.S."],"dc:date":"2012-05-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.392162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.372336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.371685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.358385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.352711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.350785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.346887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.345013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.339267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.337877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.33779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.328281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.328281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.328281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.328281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.328281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.328281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.328281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.328281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.328281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Identifying how these factors integrate should thereby allow design rules to be developed that allow optimal delivery of satiety for consumers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yeoman, M.","Chambers, L.","Ells, H."],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5067568,"sim:weight":0.496818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43442,"sim:weight":0.280164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.193262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103049,"sim:weight":0.186385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708494,"sim:weight":0.182235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86101,"sim:weight":0.179366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.165084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108247,"sim:weight":0.16396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.16197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43341,"sim:weight":0.160616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.155044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710109,"sim:weight":0.151594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.148693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709495,"sim:weight":0.143148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101367,"sim:weight":0.138655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.133256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.133256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9429093,"sim:weight":0.132375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43529,"sim:weight":0.131841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101488,"sim:weight":0.127411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One option for the supportive treatment of these conditions is plasmapheresis, in which plasma, after being separated from the cellular components of the blood, is cleansed by\r\nadsorption of harmful molecules on polymers or activated carbon. In this work, the adsorption\r\ncharacteristics of activated carbon beads with levels of activation ranging from 0 to 86% were\r\nassessed for both hydrophobic compounds accumulating in liver failure (bilirubin, cholic acid, phenol and tryptophan) and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-6). Progressive\r\nactivation resulted in significant gradual reduction of both bulk density and mean particle size, in an increase in the specific surface area, and to changes in pore size distribution with progressive broadening of micropores. These structural changes went hand in hand with enhanced adsorption of small adsorbates, such as IL-6 and cholic acid and, to a lesser extent,\r\nalso of large molecules, such as TNF-α.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tripisciano, C.","Kozynchenko, O.P.","Linsberger, I.","Phillips, G.J.","Howell, C.A.","Sandeman, S.R.","Tennison, S.R.","Mikhalovsky, S.V.","Weber, V.","Falkenhagen, D."],"dc:date":"2011-08-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Yet such claims must be strongly qualified. Whilst sport is conspicuously present in Europe as an everyday activity, it is elusively variegated in its social and cultural forms and impacts, and historically informed scholarship points to a more sophisticated approach to the understanding of the subject. At the same time, national histories – conceived largely within national frameworks – hold sway in the field of sports history. There is little truly comparative work and this lack allows the European Commission to put out its statements unchallenged. This article proposes a number of ways in which European sports history might be conceived comparatively. It outlines four different models of European sport (British, German, Soviet, Scandinavian), whilst highlighting the problems inherent in such modelling; argues for greater historical depth (e.g. the importance of Italy in the early modern period); warns against the dangers of presentism (e.g. highlighting the proximity of dance and gymnastics in earlier periods); challenges the hegemony of British sport; and champions the cause of a serious consideration of Eastern Europe.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tomlinson, A.","Young, C."],"dc:date":"2011-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
