Independent control variables employed in the model were [Ca2+] in the cytosol, [Ca2+] in intracellular stores, and smooth muscle membrane potential. Interactions between ryanodine- and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores and transmembrane ion fluxes via K+ channels, Cl? channels, and voltage-operated Ca2+ channels were studied by comparing simulations of oscillatory behavior with experimental measurements of membrane potential, intracellular free [Ca2+] and vessel diameter during a range of pharmacological interventions. The main conclusion of the study is that a general model of vasomotion that predicts experimental data can be constructed by a low-order system that incorporates nonlinear interactions between dynamical control variables.","bibo:AuthorList":["Parthimos, Dimitris","Haddock, R.

However, it is assumed that catecholamine and metabolite values resulting from the effects of surgery per se in the early postoperative period would overlap with the values generated by a tumour, and it is not known how soon after biochemical investigations can be carried out. \r\n\r\nAim: To study patterns of urinary catecholamine excretion and the feasibility of biochemical screening for phaeochromocytomas in the immediate postoperative period in otherwise healthy subjects undergoing a single type of major surgical procedure. \r\n\r\nMethods: Catecholamines and metabolites were measured for each mole of creatinine in single voided urine on one preoperative and four postoperative days in five subjects who underwent elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery with an uncomplicated postoperative course. Reference ranges were established from 33 healthy normotensive volunteers. \r\n\r\nResults: Excretion of adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, vanillylmandelic acid, and metadrenaline was within normal limits. Normetadrenaline excretion was mildly raised in four patients, but did not exceed 1.5 times the upper reference limit, and returned to normality by the fourth postoperative day. \r\n\r\nConclusion: It is feasible to perform simple urinary screening for possible phaeochromocytoma in the immediate postoperative period.","bibo:AuthorList":["Syed, A.

Physicochemical characteristics of the RyR2 model monomer were compared with the template, including homology, predicted secondary structure, surface area, hydrophobicity, and electrostatic potential. Values were comparable with those of KcsA. Monomers of the RyR2 model were minimized and assembled into a tetramer that was, in turn, minimized. The assembled tetramer adopts a structure equivalent to that of KcsA with a central pore. Characteristics of the RyR2 model tetramer were compared with the KcsA template, including average empirical energy, strain energy, solvation free energy, solvent accessibility, and hydrophobic, polar, acid, and base moments. Again, values for the model and template were comparable. The pores of KcsA and RyR2 have a common motif with a hydrophobic channel that becomes polar at both entrances. Quantitative comparisons indicate that the assembled structure provides a plausible model for the pore of RyR2. Movement of Ca2+, K+, and tetraethylammonium (TEA+) through the model RyR2 pore were simulated with explicit solvation. These simulations suggest that the model RyR2 pore is permeable to Ca2+ and K+ with rates of translocation greater for K+. In contrast, simulations indicate that tetraethylammonium blocks movement of metal cations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Welch, William","Rheault, Shana","West, Duncan J.","Williams, Alan John"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","doi":"10.1529/biophysj.104.044180","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44290,"sim:weight":0.201263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269867,"sim:weight":0.176706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98560,"sim:weight":0.133652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26920,"sim:weight":0.100106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.0985458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47658,"sim:weight":0.0973565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47361,"sim:weight":0.0858511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387245,"sim:weight":0.0854042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47603,"sim:weight":0.0850891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46779,"sim:weight":0.0842187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12333,"sim:weight":0.0799634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17921,"sim:weight":0.0726154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99378,"sim:weight":0.0724072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384221,"sim:weight":0.0695404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385531,"sim:weight":0.0691138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387413,"sim:weight":0.0668395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.065238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.0611087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.0599118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47544,"sim:weight":0.0591417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The massive cytoplasmic domain of RyR is believed to be responsible for regulating channel function. We investigated interaction between the transmembrane Ca2+-releasing pore and a panel of cytoplasmic domains of the human cardiac RyR in living cells. Expression of eGFP-tagged RyR constructs encoding distinct transmembrane topological models profoundly altered intracellular Ca2+ handling and was refractory to modulation by ryanodine, FKBP12.6 and caffeine. The impact of coexpressing dsRed-tagged cytoplasmic domains of RyR2 on intracellular Ca2+ phenotype was assessed using confocal microscopy coupled with parallel determination of in situ protein: protein interaction using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Dynamic interactions between RyR cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains were mediated by amino acids 3722-4610 (Interacting or \"I\"-domain) which critically modulated intracellular Ca2+ handling and restored RyR sensitivity to caffeine activation. These results provide compelling evidence that specific interaction between cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains is an important mechanism in the intrinsic modulation of RyR Ca2+ release channels.","bibo:AuthorList":["George, Christopher","Jundi, Hala","Thomas, Nia Lowri","Scoote, Mark","Walters, Nicola","Williams, Alan John","Lai, Francis Anthony"],"dc:date":"2004-06-01","doi":"10.1091/mbc.E03-09-0688","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1393909,"sim:weight":0.131185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":827912,"sim:weight":0.124616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24400,"sim:weight":0.124509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46531,"sim:weight":0.121089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.105331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80948,"sim:weight":0.105158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45616,"sim:weight":0.100464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81443,"sim:weight":0.0927828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98677,"sim:weight":0.090893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98959,"sim:weight":0.0845963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98640,"sim:weight":0.0819007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393884,"sim:weight":0.0786018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99061,"sim:weight":0.0715214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45146,"sim:weight":0.0701116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0694481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study was a prospective cohort study modelling the association between PD, measured\r\nusing the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and non-fatal myocardial infarction\r\n(NFMI) and fatal/non-fatal myocardial infarction (FNFMI).The relationship was modelled in a\r\nseries of logistic regression models adjusted for age, then cigarette smoking, then social position,\r\nand finally for all sociodemographic characteristics, coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, and\r\nbaseline CHD.\r\nResults. PD was associated with a 70% and 68% increased risk of NFMI and FNFMI in fully\r\nadjusted analysis. However, PD was not associated with an increased risk of NFMI and FNFMI in\r\nanalyses excluding those with baseline CHD.

This study suggests that PD is a moderator of the increased risk of MI associated with\r\nexisting physical illness.

In this study, we have shown that FH-deficient cells and tumours accumulate fumarate and, to a lesser extent, succinate. SDH-deficient tumours principally accumulate succinate. In situ analyses showed that these tumours also have over-expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1?

Our data provide in vivo evidence to support the hypothesis that increased succinate and/or fumarate causes stabilization of HIF1? a plausible mechanism, inhibition of HIF prolyl hydroxylases, has previously been suggested by in vitro studies.

The proteins interact directly with one another and mutations affecting either gene result in the tuberous sclerosis phenotype. However, the regions of hamartin and tuberin that interact have not been well defined, and the relationship between their interaction and the pathogenesis of tuberous sclerosis has not been explored. To address these issues a series of hamartin and tuberin constructs were used to assay for interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system. Hamartin (amino acids 302–430) and tuberin (amino acids 1–418) interacted strongly with one another. A region of tuberin encoding a putative coiled-coil (amino acids 346–371) was necessary but not sufficient to mediate the interaction with hamartin, as more N-terminal residues were also required. A region of hamartin (amino acids 719–998) predicted to encode coiled-coils was capable of oligermerization but was not important for the interaction with tuberin. Subtle, non-truncating mutations identified in patients with tuberous sclerosis and located within the putative binding regions of hamartin (N198_F199delinsI;593–595delACT) or tuberin (G294E and I365del), abolished or dramatically reduced interaction of the proteins as assessed by yeast two-hybrid assays and by co-immunoprecipitation of the full-length proteins from Cos7 cells. In contrast, three non-pathogenic missense polymorphisms of tuberin (R261W, M286V, R367Q) in the same region as the disease-causing TSC2 mutations did not. These results indicate a requirement for interaction in critical growth suppressing functions of hamartin and tuberin.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hodges, Angela K.","Li, Shaowei","Maynard, Julie Helen","Parry, Lee","Braverman, Richard","DeClue, Jeffrey E.","Cheadle, Jeremy Peter","Sampson, Julian Roy"],"dc:date":"2001-12-01","doi":"10.1093/hmg","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24922,"sim:weight":0.21086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.166984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.165139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.16422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99431,"sim:weight":0.161461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.155052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44537,"sim:weight":0.147755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266339,"sim:weight":0.144736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.140968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384092,"sim:weight":0.140226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98535,"sim:weight":0.129455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45146,"sim:weight":0.127135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45616,"sim:weight":0.127091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385402,"sim:weight":0.126496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382417,"sim:weight":0.11872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99061,"sim:weight":0.116405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.113655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.10861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65786,"sim:weight":0.104835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573524,"sim:weight":0.10074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This implies that despite telomerase activity, substantial telomere length variation can be generated and tolerated in the germline; in order to investigate this further, we have examined the nature of telomere length variation in the human male germline. Here, we describe an analysis of both genome-wide telomere length and single molecule analysis of specific chromosome ends in human sperm. We observed individual specific differences in genome-wide telomere length. This variation may result from genetic differences within the components that determine the telomere length setting of each individual. Superimposed on the genome wide telomere length setting was a stochastic component of variation that generates germ-cells containing severely truncated telomeres. If not re-lengthened during early embryogenesis, such telomeres may limit the replicative capacity of cells derived from the zygote and have the potential to create fusagenic chromosomes, unbalanced translocations and terminal micro-deletions.

Using single telomere length analysis (STELA) we show that the mean rate of telomere shortening in WS bulk cultures ranges between that of normal fibroblasts [99 bp/population doubling (PD)] and four times that of normal (355 bp/PD). The telomere erosion rate in the fastest eroding strain slows in the later stages of culture to that observed in normal fibroblasts, and appears to be correlated with a reduction in the heterogeneity of the telomere-length distributions. Telomere erosion rates in clones of WS cells are much reduced compared with bulk cultures, as are the variances of the telomere-length distributions. The overall lack of length heterogeneity and the normal erosion rates of the clonal populations are consistent with simple end-replication losses as the major contributor to telomere erosion in WS cells. We propose that telomere dynamics at the single cell level in WS fibroblasts are not significantly different from those in normal fibroblasts, and suggest that the accelerated replicative decline seen in WS fibroblasts does not result from accelerated telomere erosion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Baird, Duncan Martin","Davis, Terence","Rowson, Janet Maud","Jones, Christopher John","Kipling, David Glyn"],"dc:date":"2004-07-15","doi":"10.1093/hmg","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1024108,"sim:weight":0.601508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46363,"sim:weight":0.536431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387355,"sim:weight":0.383451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23717,"sim:weight":0.152346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99391,"sim:weight":0.124643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26934,"sim:weight":0.10296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.100667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98876,"sim:weight":0.0950826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0832622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384221,"sim:weight":0.0827577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.0820333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.0811011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99247,"sim:weight":0.0739025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98732,"sim:weight":0.0707174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385402,"sim:weight":0.0705175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99242,"sim:weight":0.0650022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45771,"sim:weight":0.0618445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23818,"sim:weight":0.0530857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this study, we investigate the role of synovial macrophages and their main proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?), in driving osteoarthritis synovitis and influencing the production of other pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, production of matrix metalloproteinases, and expression of aggrecanases in the osteoarthritis synovium. We established a model of cultures of synovial cells from digested osteoarthritis synovium derived from patients undergoing knee or hip arthroplasties. By means of anti-CD14-conjugated magnetic beads, specific depletion of osteoarthritis synovial macrophages from these cultures could be achieved. The CD14+-depleted cultures no longer produced significant amounts of macrophage-derived cytokines like IL-1 and TNF-?. Interestingly, there was also significant downregulation of several cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8 (p \u003c 0.001) and matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 (p \u003c 0.01), produced chiefly by synovial fibroblasts. To investigate the mechanisms involved, we went on to use specific downregulation of IL-1 and/or TNF-? in these osteoarthritis cultures of synovial cells. The results indicated that neutralisation of both IL-1 and TNF-? was needed to achieve a degree of cytokine (IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and matrix metalloproteinase (1, 3, 9, and 13) inhibition, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), similar to that observed in CD14+-depleted cultures. Another interesting observation was that in these osteoarthritis cultures of synovial cells, IL-1? production was independent of TNF-?, in contrast to the situation in rheumatoid arthritis. Using RT-PCR, we also demonstrated that whereas the ADAMTS4 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs 4) aggrecanase was driven mainly by TNF-?, ADAMTS5 was not affected by neutralisation of IL-1 and/or TNF-?. These results suggest that, in the osteoarthritis synovium, both inflammatory and destructive responses are dependent largely on macrophages and that these effects are cytokine-driven through a combination of IL-1 and TNF-?.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bondeson, Jan","Wainwright, Shane D.","Lauder, Sarah Nicol","Amos, Nick","Hughes, Clare Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","doi":"10.1186/ar2099","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2776586,"sim:weight":0.426594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387003,"sim:weight":0.417831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":897707,"sim:weight":0.34374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.32733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":551955,"sim:weight":0.326353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269992,"sim:weight":0.318943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99258,"sim:weight":0.303279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.285692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929817,"sim:weight":0.272188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.271713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.270022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.266187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.260396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.249065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.246202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.241929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.232693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.223878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23815,"sim:weight":0.222262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.211768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The agents tested were: penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, imipenem, co-amoxiclav, piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazole. MIC50 and MIC90 values for each drug-species combination were calculated whenever suitable numbers of each species were obtained. \r\nResults: Excellent spectra of activity (0% resistance) against GPAC were seen for metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem and chloramphenicol. Low degrees of resistance to co-amoxiclav (3.5%), clindamycin (7.1%), penicillin (7.1%) and significant degrees of resistance to tetracycline (41.6%) and erythromycin (27.4%) were detected. Some examples of putative macrolide-lincosamide linked resistance were noted in seven (6.2%) isolates of GPAC. \r\nConclusion: This study is one of the largest susceptibility studies specifically","bibo:AuthorList":["Brazier, J.

The macrophage mannose receptor (MR) and complement receptor 3 (CR3) have historically been considered the major macrophage lectins involved in the nonopsonic recognition of these yeast-derived particles. Using specific carbohydrate inhibitors, we show that a ?-glucan receptor, but not the MR, is a predominant receptor involved in this process. Furthermore, nonopsonic zymosan binding was unaffected by genetic CD11b deficiency or a blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CR3, demonstrating that CR3 was not the ?-glucan receptor mediating this activity. To address the role of the recently described ?-glucan receptor, Dectin-1, we generated a novel anti–Dectin-1 mAb, 2A11. Using this mAb, we show here that Dectin-1 was almost exclusively responsible for the ?-glucan–dependent, nonopsonic recognition of zymosan by primary macro-phages. These findings define Dectin-1 as the leukocyte ?-glucan receptor, first described over 50 years ago, and resolves the long-standing controversy regarding the identity of this important molecule. Furthermore, these results identify Dectin-1 as a new target for examining the immunomodulatory properties of ?-glucans for therapeutic drug design.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Gordon D.","Taylor, Philip Russel","Reid, Delyth M.","Willment, Janet A.","Williams, David L.","Martinez-Pomares, Luisa","Wong, Simon Y.

Illness is caused by pathogen replication and disruption of airway homeostasis by excessive expansion of cell numbers. One strategy to prevent lung immune–mediated damage involves reducing the cellular burden. To date, antiinflammatory strategies have affected both antigen-specific and naive immune repertoires. Here we report a novel form of immune intervention that specifically targets recently activated T cells alone. OX40 (CD134) is absent on naive T cells but up-regulated 1–2 d after antigen activation. OX40–immunoglobulin fusion proteins block the interaction of OX40 with its ligand on antigen-presenting cells and eliminate weight loss and cachexia without preventing virus clearance. Reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of lung cells accompanied the improved clinical phenotype. Manipulation of this late costimulatory pathway has clear therapeutic potential for the treatment of dysregulated lung immune responses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Humphreys, Ian","Walzl, Gerhard","Hussell, Tracy","Hill, Sue"],"dc:date":"2003-10-20","doi":"10.1084/jem.20030351","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269992,"sim:weight":0.518292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27251,"sim:weight":0.391448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.381004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.361132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.335647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.332317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.318869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382885,"sim:weight":0.282947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.267701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98707,"sim:weight":0.261673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.261155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.24596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269997,"sim:weight":0.235192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.217959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.214312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.20696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.205038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99242,"sim:weight":0.201185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.193513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.193212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We now report that IFN-gamma controls PMN infiltration and modulates IL-6 signaling through its soluble receptor (sIL-6R) to promote their apoptosis and clearance. Induction of peritoneal inflammation in IFN-gamma-deficient (IFN-gamma-/-) mice emphasized that the initial rate of PMN recruitment was impaired. This defect in PMN recruitment was also associated with the suppressed intraperitoneal expression of IL-1beta and IL-6. Reconstitution of IFN-gamma signaling restored the rate of PMN infiltration and IL-6 levels and was accompanied by normalization of PMN-activating CXC chemokine expression. To test whether local IL-6 signaling modulated PMN recruitment, inflammation was induced in IFN-gamma-/- and IL-6-/- mice and cytokine signaling adapted by intraperitoneal sIL-6R-IL-6 fusion protein (HYPER-IL-6) or IFN-gamma. Although HYPER-IL-6 attenuated PMN influx in IFN-gamma-/- mice, IFN-gamma had no effect on PMN infiltration in IL-6-/- mice. Examination of the leukocyte infiltrate from IFN-gamma-/-, IL-6-/-, and wild-type mice showed that apoptosis was aberrant in the absence of IFN-gamma and IL-6 as a result of impaired sIL-6R signaling. These data emphasize a pivotal role for IFN-gamma in regulating innate immunity through control of both the recruitment and clearance phases of PMN trafficking.","bibo:AuthorList":["McLoughlin, Rachel Mary","Witowski, Janusz","Robson, Rachel L.","Wilkinson, Thomas S.","Hurst, Suzanne Maria","Williams, Anwen Sian","Williams, John David","Rose-John, Stefan","Jones, Simon Arnett","Topley, Nicholas"],"dc:date":"2003-08-01","doi":"10.1172/JCI200317129","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":87885,"sim:weight":0.148149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":922917,"sim:weight":0.142116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99242,"sim:weight":0.133077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269992,"sim:weight":0.123588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":653284,"sim:weight":0.121185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1094644,"sim:weight":0.117986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":893884,"sim:weight":0.108924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":923871,"sim:weight":0.108783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.101819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":895645,"sim:weight":0.101103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.0947825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.084517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99439,"sim:weight":0.0805661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99258,"sim:weight":0.0634141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.0633147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99193,"sim:weight":0.0590391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387003,"sim:weight":0.0585508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25865,"sim:weight":0.0573469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0560162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98707,"sim:weight":0.0511321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, mechanisms controlling memory T cell migration to peripheral tissues such as the skin are poorly understood. Here, we show that the majority of human T cells in healthy skin express the chemokine receptor CCR8 and respond to its selective ligand I-309/CCL1. These CCR8+ T cells are absent in small intestine and colon tissue, and are extremely rare in peripheral blood, suggesting healthy skin as their physiological target site. Cutaneous CCR8+ T cells are preactivated and secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor–? and interferon-?, but lack markers of cytolytic T cells. Secretion of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor–? was low to undetectable, arguing against a strict association of CCR8 expression with either T helper cell 2 or regulatory T cell subsets. Potential precursors of skin surveillance T cells in peripheral blood may correspond to the minor subset of CCR8+CD25? T cells. Importantly, CCL1 is constitutively expressed at strategic cutaneous locations, including dermal microvessels and epidermal antigen-presenting cells. For the first time, these findings define a chemokine system for homeostatic T cell traffic in normal human skin.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schaerli, Patrick","Ebert, Lisa","Willimann, Katharina","Blaser, Andrea","Roos, Regula Stuber","Loetscher, Pius","Moser, Bernhard"],"dc:date":"2004-05-03","doi":"10.1084/jem.20032177","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269992,"sim:weight":0.57283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76925,"sim:weight":0.563597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27251,"sim:weight":0.454801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75685,"sim:weight":0.433843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.433421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.413283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10887,"sim:weight":0.38705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.375046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.366963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387702,"sim:weight":0.352236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.339839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.327948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387803,"sim:weight":0.327681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.305368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.305345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.302653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99193,"sim:weight":0.299864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929817,"sim:weight":0.296017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98707,"sim:weight":0.295983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.286756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Despite control of viral infection by strong T cell responses in visceral organs cytomegalovirus replication continues in the salivary glands of mice, suggesting that the virus exploits the mucosal microenvironment. Here, we show that T cell immunity in the salivary glands is limited by the induction of CD4 T cells expressing the regulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. Blockade of IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) with an antagonist antibody dramatically reduced viral load in the salivary glands, but not in the spleen. The mucosa-specific protection afforded by IL-10R blockade was associated with an increased accumulation of CD4 T cells expressing interferon [gamma], suggesting that IL-10R signaling limits effector T cell differentiation. Consistent with this, an agonist antibody targeting the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member OX40 (TNFRSF4) enhanced effector T cell differentiation and increased the number of interferon [gamma]–producing T cells, thus limiting virus replication in the salivary glands. Collectively, the results indicate that modulating effector T cell differentiation can counteract pathogen exploitation of the mucosa, thus limiting persistent virus replication and transmission.","bibo:AuthorList":["Humphreys, Ian","De Trez, Carl","Kinkade, April","Benedict, Chris A.","Croft, Michael","Ware, Carl F."],"dc:date":"2007-05-14","doi":"10.1084/jem.20062424","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269992,"sim:weight":0.439705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99193,"sim:weight":0.375761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27251,"sim:weight":0.327571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.310341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.28376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.256208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.246103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.223765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98707,"sim:weight":0.216077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.206965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.204931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382885,"sim:weight":0.19002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99242,"sim:weight":0.185989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.180475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99439,"sim:weight":0.172376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.136946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.135532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.135232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.121997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here, we used point-mutated peptide–major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHCI) antigens, unbiased TCRB gene usage analysis, and polychromatic flow cytometry to probe directly ex vivo the clonal architecture of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell populations under conditions of persistent exposure to structurally stable virus-derived epitopes. During chronic infection with cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, CD8+ T cell responses to immunodominant viral antigens were oligoclonal, highly skewed, and exhibited diverse clonotypic configurations; TCRB CDR3 sequence analysis indicated positive selection at the protein level. Dominant clonotypes demonstrated high intrinsic antigen avidity, defined strictly as a physical parameter, and were preferentially driven toward terminal differentiation in phenotypically heterogeneous populations. In contrast, subdominant clonotypes were characterized by lower intrinsic avidities and proportionately greater dependency on the pMHCI–CD8 interaction for antigen uptake and functional sensitivity. These findings provide evidence that interclonal competition for antigen operates in human T cell populations, while preferential CD8 coreceptor compensation mitigates this process to maintain clonotypic diversity. Vaccine strategies that reconstruct these biological processes could generate T cell populations that mediate optimal delivery of antiviral effector function.","bibo:AuthorList":["Price, David","Brenchley, Jason M.","Ruff, Laura E.","Betts, Michael R.","Hill, Brenna J.","Roederer, Mario","Koup, Richard A.","Migueles, Steven A.","Gostick, Emma","Wooldridge, Linda","Sewell, Andrew","Connors, Mark","Douek, Daniel C."],"dc:date":"2005-11-21","doi":"10.1084/jem.20051357","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269992,"sim:weight":0.401291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27251,"sim:weight":0.390595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.333592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387743,"sim:weight":0.327681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.28646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.284721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76486,"sim:weight":0.280929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.273834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.261939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.247138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930889,"sim:weight":0.223594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352179,"sim:weight":0.222982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387706,"sim:weight":0.21734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98707,"sim:weight":0.213864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382885,"sim:weight":0.200158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.193712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.190877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98529,"sim:weight":0.18773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384092,"sim:weight":0.181936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.181349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Validity was investigated using 7 days of ambulatory monitoring with the Step Watch™ step activity monitor, laboratory based measures of gait and the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI) in 10 patients with multiple sclerosis, 10 with Parkinson’s disease, and 10 with a primary muscle disorder. Additionally, 30 healthy subjects participated in the study. Two clinical illustrations of ambulatory monitoring are provided. \r\n\r\nResults: The mean (range) right step count of 7 days of monitoring in both healthy and neurological patients proved a reliable measure of activity (intra-class correlations 0.89 and 0.86 respectively). The 7 day mean (range) right step count was 5951 (2886?9955) in healthy subjects, 3818 (1611?5391) in patients with Parkinson’s disease, 3003 (716?5302) in those with muscular disorders, and 2985 (689–5340) in those with multiple sclerosis. A moderate correlation was noted between 7 day mean step count and gait speed (r?\u003d?0.45, p?\u003d?0.01) in the grouped neurological patients but not the RMI (rs?\u003d?0.3, p?\u003d?0.11). \r\n\r\nConclusion: Ambulatory monitoring provides a reliable and valid measure of activity levels. Neurological patients, living independently, demonstrate lower activity levels than healthy matched controls. Ambulatory monitoring as an outcome measure has potential for improving the evaluation of ambulation and providing insight into participation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Busse, Monica","Pearson, Owen R.","Van Deursen, Robert William Martin","Wiles, Charles Mark"],"dc:date":"2004-06-01","doi":"10.1136/jnnp.2003.020180","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"M E Busse, O R Pearson and R Van Deursen.

Measures of isometric knee extension/flexion muscle strength, time to stand up (sit-to-stand, STS), gait speed, and daily step counts (recorded over 7 days) were obtained. The Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI) provided a measure of functional ability. Between group differences and associations were explored. Backward stepwise regression analysis was used to identify variables influencing daily step count in individuals with neurological impairment. \r\n\r\nResults: Patients were significantly weaker (mean (SD) quadriceps strength 69±34% v 102±37% predicted), slower to stand up (2.9±1.3 v 2.0±0.6 s), and had slower self selected gait speed (0.74±0.3 v 1.2±0.2 m/s) than controls. Mean daily step count was also lower (3090±1902 v 6374±1819) than in controls.

Adenosine stimulated IL-6 but inhibited osteoprotegerin secretion, suggesting that adenosine is a newly described regulator of progenitor cell function.\r\n\r\nIntroduction: Maintaining skeletal homeostasis relies on there being a balance between bone formation and resorption; an imbalance between these processes can lead to diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent reports showed that locally produced ATP, acting through P2 receptors, has pronounced effects on bone formation. However, ATP can be enzymatically cleaved to adenosine that has little or no activity at P2 receptors but mediates its action through the P1 family of receptors. We studied whether adenosine may also have an important role in controlling bone cell differentiation and function.\r\n\r\nMaterials and Methods: Extracellular adenosine levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography in HCC1 and bone marrow stromal (BMS) cells. Ecto-5?-nucleotidase (CD73) expression and activity was determined by RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and the cleavage of etheno-AMP to ethenoadenosine. Adenosine receptor expression and activity were determined by RT-PCR and cAMP measurements. The effects of adenosine receptor agonists on IL-6, osteoprotegerin (OPG), and RANKL expression were determined by ELISA and QRT-PCR.\r\n\r\nResults: HCC1 and BMS cells produce adenosine and express CD73 and all four adenosine receptor subtypes. The A2b receptor was shown to be functionally dominant in HCC1 cells, as determined by cAMP production and in its stimulation of IL-6 secretion. Adenosine receptor agonism also inhibited OPG secretion and OPG but not RANKL mRNA expression.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Our findings show that HCC1 and primary BMS cells produce adenosine, express CD73 and all four adenosine receptor subtypes. In HCC1 cells, adenosine has a potent stimulatory action on IL-6 secretion but an inhibitory action on OPG expression. These data show for the first time that adenosine may be an important regulator of progenitor cell differentiation and hence an important local contributor to the regulation of bone formation and resorption.","bibo:AuthorList":["Evans, Bronwen Alice James","Elford, Carole","Pexa, Annette","Francis, Karen","Hughes, Alis C.","Deussen, Andreas","Ham, Jack"],"dc:date":"2006-02-01","doi":"10.1359/JBMR.051021","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48230,"sim:weight":0.604467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382406,"sim:weight":0.447874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":835186,"sim:weight":0.338317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1030313,"sim:weight":0.299557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":551943,"sim:weight":0.199464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":886718,"sim:weight":0.175066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":557919,"sim:weight":0.174614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":975398,"sim:weight":0.172543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.161779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269992,"sim:weight":0.160552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386738,"sim:weight":0.139673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.133189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98849,"sim:weight":0.129846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1031055,"sim:weight":0.125437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.121541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.119502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99258,"sim:weight":0.107491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387047,"sim:weight":0.105448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386803,"sim:weight":0.104704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.088822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Included: studies that defined patterns of bruising in non-abused or abused children \u003c18 years. Excluded: personal practice, review articles, single case reports, inadequate confirmation of abuse. Two independent full text reviews using standardised data extraction and critical appraisal forms. Studies ranked by study design and definition of abuse used. \r\n\r\nResults: Twenty three studies included: seven non-abusive bruising, 14 abusive bruising, and two both. Non-abusive: The prevalence, number, and location of bruises is related to increased motor development. Bruising in non-independently mobile babies is very uncommon (\u003c1%). Seventeen per cent of infants who are starting to mobilise, 53% of walkers, and the majority of schoolchildren have bruises. These are small, sustained over bony prominences, and found on the front of the body. Abuse: Bruising is common in children who are abused. Any part of the body is vulnerable. Bruises are away from bony prominences; the commonest site is head and neck (particularly face) followed by the buttocks, trunk, and arms. Bruises are large, commonly multiple, and occur in clusters. They are often associated with other injury types that may be older. Some bruises carry the imprint of the implement used. \r\n\r\nConclusion: When abuse is suspected, bruising must be assessed in the context of medical, social, and developmental history, the explanation given, and the patterns of non-abusive bruising. Bruises in non-mobile infants, over soft tissue areas, that carry the imprint of an implement and multiple bruises of uniform shape are suggestive of abuse. Quality research across the whole spectrum of children is urgently needed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maguire, Sabine","Mann, Mala K.","Sibert, Jonathan","Kemp, Alison Mary"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","doi":"10.1136/adc.2003.044065","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There is considerable variation within and between countries in general medical practitionersâ€™ (GPsâ€™) prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as fluroquinolones, and resistance to these agents is increasing worldwide. Urgently promoting cautious fluroquinolone prescribing in primary care may limit increase in resistance. \r\n\r\nObjective. We therefore interviewed 40 GPs in order to explore the reasons for their choice of prescribed antibiotic, in particular their decision to prescribe fluroquinolones. \r\n\r\nMethods. We used a grounded theory approach to data collection and analysis, incorporating purposive and theoretical sampling, based on high and average fluroquinolone prescribing. Interviews were conducted with 26 GPs from practices known to be high prescribers of fluroquinolone antibiotics and 14 from average fluroquinolone prescribing practices. \r\n\r\nResults. Chosing to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as a fluroquinolone, rather than a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, related to a number of clinical considerations, perceptions of patient expectations and organizational influences. GPs from high fluroquinolone prescribing practices were more likely to prioritize patientsâ€™ immediate needs, whereas GPs from average prescribing practices were more likely to consider longer term issues. GPs from both high and average fluroquinolone prescribing practices justified their antibiotic choices on the basis of a desire to do their best for their patients and society. \r\n\r\nConclusion. Choosing to prescribe powerful, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as fluroquinolones, as well as choosing to keep these agents in reserve, was justified on the basis of social responsibility. Strategies to change fluroquinolone and broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing will need to take into account cliniciansâ€™ perceptions of social responsibility.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wood, Fiona Claire","Simpson, Sharon Anne","Butler, Christopher Collett"],"dc:date":"2007-10","doi":"10.1093/fampra","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.379445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23024,"sim:weight":0.304136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780059,"sim:weight":0.25353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.210074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.174286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108487,"sim:weight":0.165407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.14527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77040,"sim:weight":0.142949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25905,"sim:weight":0.138304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1655008,"sim:weight":0.131058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632061,"sim:weight":0.129278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.117282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For behavioural change to occur, individuals need to perceive the issue as important to them and feel able to make a valuable contribution. Public campaigns have, so far, not been informed by detailed understanding of public attitudes to the problem. We therefore set out to explore the attitudes of members of the public to bacterial resistance. \r\n\r\nMethods: A qualitative grounded theory interview study was undertaken. A purposive maximum variation sample included 32 (70%) women and 14 (30%) men, aged from 18 to 89 years, from areas of high, average and low deprivation. \r\n\r\nResults: Participants were uncertain about bacterial resistance and their explanations were generally incongruent with prevailing biomedical concepts. Perceived importance and personal threat were low. The media was the main information source and it left the impression that dirty hospitals are the main cause. Some participants dreaded hospitalization because they feared resistant infections. Few recognized resistant infections as a problem in the community. Less than a quarter indicated that they could positively influence the situation by expecting antibiotic prescriptions less often, or taking antibiotics according to instructions, and even fewer through their own hand washing behaviour. \r\n\r\nConclusions: Although members of the public can contribute to containing bacterial resistance, most do not feel that they have a personal role in either the problem or its solution.

Case patients were those with ampicillin- or trimethoprim-resistant infections and control patients had infections that were susceptible to antibiotics, including ampicillin and trimethoprim.\r\n\r\nResults Risk of ampicillin-resistant E. coli infection in 903 patients was associated with amoxicillin prescriptions of ?7 days duration in the previous 1 month [odds ratio (OR) \u003d 3.91, 95% CI 1.64–9.34] and previous 2–3 months (2.29, 1.12–4.70) before illness onset.

The objectives of the study were to examine the underlying constructs captured by an adapted version of Buckner\u0027s neighbourhood cohesion scale, and to assess the reliability of the scale at the small-area-level by combining ecometric methodology with ordinal modelling of a five-point scale.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nData were analysed from 11,078 participants in the Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Study, who were sampled from within 325 UK census enumeration districts in Caerphilly county borough, Wales, UK. The responses of interest came from 15 question items designed to capture different facets of neighbourhood cohesion. Factor analysis was used to identify constructs underlying the neighbourhood cohesion item responses. Using a multilevel ecometric model, the variability present in these ordinal responses was decomposed into contextual, compositional, item-level and residual components.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nTwo constructs labelled neighbourhood belonging and social cohesion were identified, and variability in both constructs was modelled at each level of the multilevel structure. The intra-neighbourhood correlations were 6.4% and 1.0% for the neighbourhood belonging and social cohesion subscales, respectively. Given the large sample size, contextual neighbourhood cohesion scores can be estimated reliably. The wide variation in the observed frequency of occurence of the scale item activities suggests that the two subscales have desirable ecometric properties. Further, the majority of between-neighbourhood variation is not explained by the socio-demographic characteristics of the individual respondents.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nAssessment of the properties of the adapted neighbourhood cohesion scale using factor analysis and ecometric analysis extended to an ordinal scale has shown that the items allow fine discrimination between individuals. However, large sample sizes are needed in order to accurately estimate contextual neighbourhood cohesion. The scale is therefore appropriate for use in the measurement of neighbourhood cohesion at small-area-level in future studies of neighbourhoods and health.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fone, David Lawrence","Farewell, Daniel","Dunstan, Frank David John"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","doi":"10.1186/1478-7954-4-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85735,"sim:weight":0.265254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631818,"sim:weight":0.176617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108251,"sim:weight":0.166116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76564,"sim:weight":0.15389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.14794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.140752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.12839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Some data are accruing about the effects of such approaches on health or other patient-based outcomes. These effects often vary substantially between studies.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the effects of training GPs in SDM, and the use of simple risk communication aids in general practice, on patient-based outcomes.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: A cluster randomized trial with crossover was carried out with the participation of 20 recently qualified GPs in urban and rural general practices in Gwent, South Wales. A total of 747 patients with known atrial fibrillation, prostatism, menorrhagia or menopausal symptoms were invited to a consultation to review their condition or treatments. After baseline, participating doctors were randomized to receive training in (i) SDM skills; or (ii) the use of simple risk communication aids, using simulated patients. The alternative training was then provided for the final study phase. Patients were randomly allocated to a consultation during baseline or intervention 1 (SDM or risk communication aids) or intervention 2 phases. A randomly selected half of the consultations took place in \u0027research clinics\u0027 to evaluate the effects of more time for consultations, compared with usual surgery time. Patient-based outcomes were assessed at exit from consultation and 1 month follow-up. These were: COMRADE instrument (principal measures; subscales of risk communication and confidence in decision), and a range of secondary measures (anxiety, patient enablement, intention to adhere to chosen treatment, satisfaction with decision, support in decision making and SF-12 health status measure). Multilevel modelling was carried out with outcome score as the dependent variable, and follow-up point (i.e. exit or 1 month later for each patient), patient and doctor levels of explanatory variables.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: No statistically significant changes in patient-based outcomes due to the training interventions were found: COMRADE risk communication score increased 0.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.92 to 2.32] after risk communication training and 0.9 (95% CI -0.89 to 2.35) after SDM training; and COMRADE satisfaction with communication score increased by 1.0 (95% CI -1.1 to 3.1) after risk communication, and decreased by 0.6 (95% CI 2.7 to -1.5) after SDM training. Patients\u0027 confidence in the decision (2.1 increase, 95% CI 0.7-3.5, P \u003c 0.01) and expectation to adhere to chosen treatments (0.7 increase, 95% CI 0.04-1.36, P \u003c 0.05) were significantly greater among patients seen in the research clinics (when more time was available) compared with usual surgery time. Most outcomes deteriorated between exit and 1 month later. There was no interaction between intervention effects.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Patients can be more involved in treatment decisions, and risks and benefits of treatment options can be explained in more detail, without adversely affecting patient-based outcomes. SDM and risk communication may be advocated from values and ethical principles even without evidence of health gain or improvement in patient-based outcomes, but the resources required to enhance these professional skills must also be taken into consideration. These data also indicate the benefits of extra consultation time.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edwards, Adrian G.","Elwyn, Glyn","Hood, Kerenza","Atwell, Christine Leander Angela","Robling, Michael Richard","Houston, Helen Louise Ann","Kinnersley, Paul Richard","Russell, Ian"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","doi":"10.1093/fampra","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8780059,"sim:weight":0.295917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.279096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.271576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.258543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.252879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.252646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.242659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631760,"sim:weight":0.234732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54903,"sim:weight":0.215651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76413,"sim:weight":0.212791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2753332,"sim:weight":0.206794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.199711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.191681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222798,"sim:weight":0.188788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.174771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of these competences concerns the discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment or care options-\u0027risk communication\u0027. Few data exist on clinicians\u0027 ability to acquire skills and implement the competences of SDM or risk communication in consultations with patients.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of skill development workshops for SDM and the use of risk communication aids on the process of consultations.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: A cluster randomized trial with crossover was carried out with the participation of 20 recently qualified GPs in urban and rural general practices in Gwent, South Wales. A total of 747 patients with known atrial fibrillation, prostatism, menorrhagia or menopausal symptoms were invited to a consultation to review their condition or treatments. Half the consultations were randomly selected for audio-taping, of which 352 patients attended and were audio-taped successfully. After baseline, participating doctors were randomized to receive training in (i) SDM skills or (ii) the use of simple risk communication aids, using simulated patients. The alternative training was then provided for the final study phase. Patients were allocated randomly to a consultation during baseline or intervention 1 (SDM or risk communication aids) or intervention 2 phases. A randomly selected half of the consultations were audio-taped from each phase. Raters (independent, trained and blinded to study phase) assessed the audio-tapes using a validated scale to assess levels of patient involvement (OPTION: observing patient involvement), and to analyse the nature of risk information discussed. Clinicians completed questionnaires after each consultation, assessing perceived clinician-patient agreement and level of patient involvement in decisions. Multilevel modelling was carried out with the OPTION score as the dependent variable, and rater, consultation and clinician levels of data, standardized by rater within clinician.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Following each of the interventions, the clinicians significantly increased their involvement of patients in decision making (OPTION score increased by 10.6 following risk communication training [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.9 -13.3; P \u003c 0.001] and by 12.9 after SDM skill development (95% CI 10 -15.8, P \u003c 0.001), a moderate effect size. The level of involvement achieved by the risk communication aids was significantly increased by the subsequent introduction of the skill development workshops (7.7 increase in OPTION score, 95% CI 3.4-12; P \u003c 0.001). The alternative sequence (skills followed by risk communication aids) did not achieve this effect. The use of most risk information formats increased after the provision of specific risk communication aids (P \u003c 0.001). Clinicians using the risk communication tools perceived significantly higher patient and clinician agreement on treatment (P \u003c 0.001), patient satisfaction with information (P \u003c 0.01), clinician satisfaction with decision (P \u003c 0.01) and general overall satisfaction with the consultation (P \u003c 0.001) than those who were exposed to SDM skill development workshops.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: These clinicians were able to acquire the skills to implement SDM competences and to use risk communication aids. Each intervention provided independent effects. Further progress towards greater patient involvement in health care decision making is possible, and skill development in this area should be incorporated into postgraduate professional development programmes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Elwyn, Glyn","Edwards, Adrian G.","Hood, Kerenza","Robling, Michael Richard","Atwell, Christine Leander Angela","Russell, Ian","Wensing, M.","Grol, R."],"dc:date":"2004-08","doi":"10.1093/fampra","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.258934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780059,"sim:weight":0.249649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76413,"sim:weight":0.238287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.226312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.220893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.20781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76027,"sim:weight":0.196593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.189299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108284,"sim:weight":0.186887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54903,"sim:weight":0.182959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.173429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.167118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.158157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25931,"sim:weight":0.142453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Inter-item and item-total correlations were calculated and inter-rater agreements were calculated using Cohen’s kappa. Classical inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficients and generalisability theory statistics were used to calculate inter-rater reliability coefficients. Basing the tool development on literature reviews, qualitative studies and consultations with practitioner and patients ensured content validity. Construct validity hypothesis testing was conducted by assessing score variation with respect to patient age, clinical topic “equipoise”, sex of practitioner, and success of practitioners at a professional examination. \r\n\r\nResults: The OPTION scale provided reliable scores for detecting differences between groups of consultations in the extent to which patients are involved in decision making processes in consultations. The results justify the use of the scale in further empirical studies. The inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (0.62), kappa scores for inter-rater agreement (0.71), and Cronbach’s alpha (0.79) were all above acceptable thresholds. Based on a balanced design of five consultations per clinician, the inter-rater reliability generalisability coefficient was 0.68 (two raters) and the intra-rater reliability generalisability coefficient was 0.66. On average, mean practitioner scores were very similar (and low on the overall scale of possible involvement); some practitioner scores had more variation around the mean, indicating that they varied their communication styles to a greater extent than others. \r\n\r\nConclusions: Involvement in decision making is a key facet of patient participation in health care and the OPTION scale provides a validated outcome measure for future empirical studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Elwyn, Glyn","Edwards, Adrian G.","Wensing, M.","Hood, Kerenza","Atwell, Christine Leander Angela","Grol, R."],"dc:date":"2003-01","doi":"10.1136/qhc.12.2.93","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.227268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75617,"sim:weight":0.218969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77300,"sim:weight":0.211224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631818,"sim:weight":0.205407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.202773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.192326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10910,"sim:weight":0.172667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.170964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.156439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54907,"sim:weight":0.155915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76564,"sim:weight":0.155683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.155215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76027,"sim:weight":0.148708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86024,"sim:weight":0.145299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25931,"sim:weight":0.144768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.141186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.133539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76464,"sim:weight":0.130522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56591,"sim:weight":0.122569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To address this problem, interventions directed at patients to help them gather information in their healthcare consultations have been proposed and tested.\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nTo assess the effects on patients, clinicians and the healthcare system of interventions which are delivered before consultations, and which have been designed to help patients (and/or their representatives) address their information needs within consultations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSearch strategy\r\nWe searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library (issue 3 2006); MEDLINE (1966 to September 2006); EMBASE (1980 to September 2006); PsycINFO (1985 to September 2006); and other databases, with no language restriction. We also searched reference lists of articles and related reviews, and handsearched Patient Education and Counseling (1986 to September 2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nSelection criteria\r\nRandomised controlled trials of interventions before consultations designed to encourage question asking and information gathering by the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\nData collection and analysis\r\nTwo researchers assessed the search output independently to identify potentially-relevant studies, selected studies for inclusion, and extracted data. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the included trials, and meta-analyses of five outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMain results\r\nWe identified 33 randomised controlled trials, from 6 countries and in a range of settings. A total of 8244 patients was randomised and entered into studies. The most common interventions were question checklists and patient coaching. Most interventions were delivered immediately before the consultations.\r\n\r\nCommonly-occurring outcomes were: question asking, patient participation, patient anxiety, knowledge, satisfaction and consultation length. A minority of studies showed positive effects for these outcomes. Meta-analyses, however, showed small and statistically significant increases for question asking (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.36)) and patient satisfaction (SMD 0.09 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.16)). There was a notable but not statistically significant decrease in patient anxiety before consultations (weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.56 (95% CI -7.10 to 3.97)). There were small and not statistically significant changes in patient anxiety after consultations (reduced) (SMD -0.08 (95%CI -0.22 to 0.06)), patient knowledge (reduced) (SMD -0.34 (95% CI -0.94 to 0.25)), and consultation length (increased) (SMD 0.10 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.25)). Further analyses showed that both coaching and written materials produced similar effects on question asking but that coaching produced a smaller increase in consultation length and a larger increase in patient satisfaction.\r\n\r\nInterventions immediately before consultations led to a small and statistically significant increase in consultation length, whereas those implemented some time before the consultation had no effect. Both interventions immediately before the consultation and those some time before it led to small increases in patient satisfaction, but this was only statistically significant for those immediately before the consultation. There appear to be no clear benefits from clinician training in addition to patient interventions, although the evidence is limited.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors\u0027 conclusions\r\nInterventions before consultations designed to help patients address their information needs within consultations produce limited benefits to patients. Further research could explore whether the quality of questions is increased, whether anxiety before consultations is reduced, the effects on other outcomes and the impact of training and the timing of interventions. More studies need to consider the timing of interventions and possibly the type of training provided to clinicians.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kinnersley, Paul Richard","Edwards, Adrian G.","Hood, Kerenza","Cadbury, Naomi Louise","Ryan, Rebecca","Prout, Hayley Christine","Owen, Diane","MacBeth, Fergus","Butow, Phyllis","Butler, Christopher Collett"],"dc:date":"2007-08-01","doi":"10.1002/14651858.CD004565.pub2","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.270481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780059,"sim:weight":0.263745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.255589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76413,"sim:weight":0.252083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.246862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.224302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.218441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.216078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223134,"sim:weight":0.21378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.195446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54903,"sim:weight":0.192012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.188119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76674,"sim:weight":0.187569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75310,"sim:weight":0.179503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.173667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.165743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76708,"sim:weight":0.13082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Spinal pain is common and frequently disabling. Management guidelines have encouraged referral from primary care for spinal manipulation. However, the evidence base for these recommendations is weak. More pragmatic trials and economic evaluations have been recommended.\r\n\r\nObjectives. Our aim was to assess the effectiveness and health care costs of a practice-based osteopathy clinic for subacute spinal pain.\r\n\r\nMethods. A pragmatic randomized controlled trial was carried out in a primary care osteopathy clinic accepting referrals from 14 neighbouring practices in North West Wales. A total of 201 patients with neck or back pain of 2–12 weeks duration were allocated at random between usual GP care and an additional three sessions of osteopathic spinal manipulation. The primary outcome measure was the Extended Aberdeen Spine Pain Scale (EASPS). Secondary measures included SF-12, EuroQol and Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire. Health care costs were estimated from the records of referring GPs.\r\n\r\nResults. Outcomes improved more in the osteopathy group than the usual care group. At 2 months, this improvement was significantly greater in EASPS [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7–9.8] and SF-12 mental score (95% CI 2.7–10.7). At 6 months, this difference was no longer significant for EASPS (95% CI ?1.5 to 10.4), but remained significant for SF-12 mental score (95% CI 1.0–9.9). Mean health care costs attributed to spinal pain were significantly greater by £65 in the osteopathy group (95% CI £32–£155). Though osteopathy also cost £22 more in mean total health care cost, this was not significant (95% CI ?£159 to £142).\r\n\r\nConclusion. A primary care osteopathy clinic improved short-term physical and longer term psychological outcomes, at little extra cost. Rigorous multicentre studies are now needed to assess the generalizability of this approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Nefyn Howard","Wilkinson, Clare Elizabeth","Russell, Ian","Edwards, Rhiannon T.","Hibbs, Richard","Linck, Patricia Gaynor","Muntz, Rachel"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","doi":"10.1093/fampra","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60516,"sim:weight":0.397496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60560,"sim:weight":0.361478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85606,"sim:weight":0.293586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998613,"sim:weight":0.239272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998632,"sim:weight":0.233138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.224276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77003,"sim:weight":0.224071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.222854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.211513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.199676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.196776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780059,"sim:weight":0.189754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75567,"sim:weight":0.188952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.185305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2753332,"sim:weight":0.175302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.16889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75002,"sim:weight":0.161681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222799,"sim:weight":0.13926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The authors conducted a search by systematic whole genome linkage scan for loci influencing vulnerability to bipolar affective puerperal psychosis. METHOD: The authors selected families with bipolar disorder from their previous bipolar disorder genome scan, in which there was at least one family member with a manic or psychotic episode with an onset within 6 weeks of delivery. Individuals were coded as affected if they had been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder; bipolar II disorder; or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, according to DSM-IV. A total of 36 pedigrees contributed 54 affected sibling pairs to the cohort. A genome scan with 494 microsatellite markers was analyzed using GENEHUNTER and MAPMAKER/SIBS. RESULTS: A genome-wide significant linkage signal was observed on chromosome 16p13, and a genome-wide suggestive linkage was observed on chromosome 8q24. No significant or suggestive linkage was observed in these regions in our original bipolar scan. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies chromosomal regions that are likely to harbor genes that predispose individuals to bipolar affective puerperal psychosis. The identification of susceptibility genes would enhance understanding of pathogenesis and offer the possibility of improvements in treatment and risk prediction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Ian Richard","Hamshere, Marian Lindsay","Nangle, Jeanne-Marrie","Bennett, Philip","Green, Elaine Karen","Heron, Jess","Segurado, Ricardo","Lambert, David","Holmans, Peter Alan","Corvin, Aiden","Owen, Michael John","Jones, Lisa Anne","Gill, Michael","Craddock, Nicholas John"],"dc:date":"2007-07-01","doi":"10.1176/appi.ajp.164.7.1099","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86071,"sim:weight":0.298818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24364,"sim:weight":0.207432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":117135,"sim:weight":0.20023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631504,"sim:weight":0.197749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86082,"sim:weight":0.181457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25888,"sim:weight":0.158932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25068,"sim:weight":0.14797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70652,"sim:weight":0.141888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":454818,"sim:weight":0.138798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632025,"sim:weight":0.12855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631506,"sim:weight":0.128004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.125793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.122668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75436,"sim:weight":0.122574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77984,"sim:weight":0.110488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76613,"sim:weight":0.102942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77305,"sim:weight":0.0823413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.0763138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.0751208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recent attempts to identify the gene responsible for the linkage have produced inconsistent evidence for association of DD with a number of genes in a 575-kb region of chromosome 6p22.2, including VMP, DCDC2, KIAA0319, TTRAP, and THEM2. We aimed to identify the specific gene or genes involved by performing a systematic, high-density (approximately 2-3-kb intervals) linkage disequilibrium screen of these genes in an independent sample, incorporating family-based and case-control designs in which dyslexia was defined as an extreme representation of reading disability. Using DNA pooling, we first observed evidence for association with 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 13 of which were located in the KIAA0319 gene (P\u003c.01-.003). After redundant SNPs were excluded, 10 SNPs were individually genotyped in 223 subjects with DD and 273 controls. Those SNPs that were significant at P\u003c/\u003d.05 were next genotyped in a semi-independent sample of 143 trios of probands with DD and their parents, to control for possible population stratification. Six SNPs showed significant evidence of association in both samples (P\u003c/\u003d.04-.002), including a SNP (rs4504469) in exon 4 of the KIAA0319 gene that changes an amino acid (P\u003d.002; odds ratio 1.5). Logistic regression analysis showed that two SNPs (rs4504469 and rs6935076) in the KIAA0319 gene best explained DD status. The haplotype composed of these two markers was significantly associated with DD (global P\u003d.00001 in the case-control sample; P\u003d.02 in trios). This finding was largely driven by underrepresentation of the most common haplotype in cases (P\u003d.00003 in the case-control sample; P\u003d.006 in trios; 1-degree-of-freedom tests). Our data strongly implicate KIAA0319 as a susceptibility gene for dyslexia. The gene product is expressed in brain, but its specific function is currently unknown.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bray, Nicholas John","Preece, Anna Charlotte","Williams, Nigel Melville","Moskvina, Valentina","Buckland, Paul Robert","Owen, Michael John","O\u0027Donovan, Michael Conlon"],"dc:date":"2005-04-01","doi":"10.1093/hmg","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":117135,"sim:weight":0.516161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826717,"sim:weight":0.259712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76613,"sim:weight":0.244454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76597,"sim:weight":0.228837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643971,"sim:weight":0.227612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222833,"sim:weight":0.215906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75436,"sim:weight":0.214776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631506,"sim:weight":0.207816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643983,"sim:weight":0.201624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.199128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75994,"sim:weight":0.195993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631478,"sim:weight":0.19276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.186956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76236,"sim:weight":0.182239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.172776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632025,"sim:weight":0.162553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26783,"sim:weight":0.161143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77984,"sim:weight":0.146482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25913,"sim:weight":0.145435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26759,"sim:weight":0.140454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Mutations in the gene encoding epsilon-sarcoglycan (SGCE) have been found in some patients with MDS. SGCE is a maternally imprinted gene with the disease being inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with reduced penetrance upon maternal transmission. In the central nervous system, epsilon-sarcoglycan is widely expressed in neurons of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum and the olfactory bulb. epsilon-Sarcoglycan is located at the plasma membrane in neurons, muscle and transfected cells. To determine the effect of MDS-associated mutations on the function of epsilon-sarcoglycan we examined the biosynthesis and trafficking of wild-type and mutant proteins in cultured cells. In contrast to the wild-type protein, disease-associated epsilon-sarcoglycan missense mutations (H36P, H36R and L172R) produce proteins that are undetectable at the cell surface and are retained intracellularly. These mutant proteins become polyubiquitinated and are rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Furthermore, torsinA, that is mutated in DYT1 dystonia, a rare type of primary dystonia, binds to and promotes the degradation of epsilon-sarcoglycan mutants when both proteins are co-expressed. These data demonstrate that some MDS-associated mutations in SGCE impair trafficking of the mutant protein to the plasma membrane and suggest a role for torsinA and the ubiquitin proteasome system in the recognition and processing of misfolded epsilon-sarcoglycan.","bibo:AuthorList":["Esapa, Christopher T.","Waite, Adrian","Locke, Matthew","Benson, Matthew A.","Kraus, Michaela","McIlhinney, R.

In this article\r\nthe authors examine whether the\r\nDRD4 7-repeat allele is associated with\r\nperformance on a variety of neuropsychological\r\ntasks in children with ADHD.\r\nMethod: The presence or absence of the\r\n7-repeat allele was determined in 133\r\ndrug-naive children 6 to 13 years of age\r\nwho fulfilled diagnostic criteria for ADHD.\r\nThese children were then assessed on several\r\nneuropsychological tests known to be\r\nassociated with attention, impulse control,\r\nand response inhibition (the Continuous\r\nPerformance Test, Matching Familiar\r\nFigures Test, Go/No Go Task, and Stop\r\nTask). Activity levels were assessed with\r\nan actigraph. Children with and without\r\nat least one 7-repeat allele were compared\r\nwith each other and with children\r\nin a previous population-based study.\r\nResults: Children who had the 7-repeat\r\nallele had significantly more incorrect responses\r\non the Matching Familiar Figures\r\nTest (16.1 versus 14.3) than children who\r\ndid not have the allele. Children with the\r\nallele also had shorter mean reaction\r\ntimes for incorrect responses on the\r\nMatching Familiar Figures Test (846.1 versus\r\n1103.7 msec) and on the Stop Task\r\n(116.6 versus 134.1 msec) than children\r\nwithout the allele.

Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in and full-length transgenic models of HD took longer to appear, 15- and 22-month CHL2(Q150/Q150), 18-month Hdh(Q92/Q92) and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. Whereas it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared with those caused by the expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. In addition, very high correlations between the signatures of mice expressing normal levels of wild-type huntingtin and mice in which the wild-type protein is absent suggest a limited effect of the wild-type protein to change basal gene expression or to influence the qualitative disease-related effect of mutant huntingtin. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides important temporal and mechanistic insights into the process by which mutant huntingtin kills striatal neurons. In addition, the discovery that several available lines of HD mice faithfully recapitulate the gene expression signature of the human disorder provides a novel aspect of validation with respect to their use in preclinical therapeutic trials.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kuhn, Alexandre","Goldstein, Darlene R.","Hodges, Angela Kaye","Strand, Andrew D.","Sengstag, Thierry","Kooperberg, Charles","Becanovic, Christina","Pouladi, Mahmud A.","Sathasivam, Kirupa","Cha, Jang-Ho J.","Hannon, Anthony J.","Hayden, Michael R.","Leavitt, Blair A.","Dunnett, Stephen Bruce","Ferrante, Robert J.","Albin, Roger","Shelbourne, Peggy","Delorenzi, Mauro","Augood, Sarah J.","Faull, Richard L.

Specifically, to first examine whether the influence of family conflict in predicting depressive symptoms is increased in individuals at genetic risk of depression. Second, to test whether the genetic component of variance in depressive symptoms increases as levels of family conflict increase.\r\n\r\nMethod: A longitudinal twin design was used. Children ages 5 to 16 were reassessed approximately 3 years later to test whether the influence of family conflict in predicting depressive symptoms varied according to genetic liability. The conflict subscale of the Family Environment Scale was used to assess family conflict and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire was used to assess depressive symptoms. The response rate to the questionnaire at time 1 was 73% and 65% at time 2. Controlling for initial symptoms levels (i.e., internalizing at time 1), primary analyses were conducted using ordinary least-squares multiple regression. Structural equation models, using raw score maximum likelihood estimation, were also fit to the data for the purpose of model fit comparison.\r\n\r\nResults: Results suggested significant gene-environment interaction specifically with depressive symptoms and family conflict. Genetic factors were of greater importance in the etiology of depressive symptoms where levels of family conflict were high. The effects of family conflict on depressive symptoms were greater in children and adolescents at genetic risk of depression.\r\n\r\nConclusions: The present results suggest that children with a family history of depression may be at an increased risk of developing depressive symptoms in response to family conflict. Intervention programs that incorporate one or more family systems may be of benefit in alleviating the adverse effect of negative family factors on children.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rice, Frances Jane","Harold, Gordon Thomas","Shelton, Katherine Helen","Thapar, Anita"],"dc:date":"2006-07-01","doi":"10.1097/01.chi.0000219834.08602.44","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76672,"sim:weight":0.256559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26922,"sim:weight":0.224849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76340,"sim:weight":0.206017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23453,"sim:weight":0.161821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76809,"sim:weight":0.157232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75581,"sim:weight":0.150647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76297,"sim:weight":0.148063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222627,"sim:weight":0.147969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26759,"sim:weight":0.144055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24364,"sim:weight":0.143825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23219,"sim:weight":0.143048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76475,"sim:weight":0.142634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26616,"sim:weight":0.141053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77481,"sim:weight":0.139103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23220,"sim:weight":0.13587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631901,"sim:weight":0.119146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.107193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76113,"sim:weight":0.106382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269586,"sim:weight":0.105781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recent work suggests that neuronal precursors derived from foetal striatum may have a greater capacity than primary foetal striatum to project to the usual striatal target areas such as the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, raising the possibility that they have a greater potential for circuit reconstruction. However, comparing the reconstructive capacity of the two donor cells types is confounded by the fact that many precursor experiments have been carried out in a xenogeneic background in order to utilize species-specific markers for tracking the donor cells, whereas most primary foetal transplant studies have utilized an allograft paradigm. Thus, differences in immunogenic background could influence the findings; for example, xenogeneic grafts may not recognize host inhibitory signals, thereby encouraging more profuse and extensive projections. We have addressed this issue directly by comparing foetal neural precursor and primary foetal grafts in both allo- and xenograft environments using several labelling techniques, including GFP-transgenic mice and LacZ-labelled cells as donor tissue and iontophoretic injection of the anterograde tracers BDA, neurobiotin and PHA-L in the host. We present clear evidence that foetal neural precursors produce grafts with richer axonal outgrowth than primary foetal grafts, and that this is independent of the immunogenic background. Furthermore, both neural precursor and primary grafts derived from human foetal tissue produced a significantly richer outgrowth than do grafts of mouse donor tissue, which may relate to their large final graft volume and the greater intrinsic potential of human CNS neurons for greater axon elongation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kelly, Claire","Precious, Sophie Victoria","Penketh, Richard","Amso, Nazar Najib","Dunnett, Stephen Bruce","Rosser, Anne Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2007-01","doi":"10.1093/brain","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27416,"sim:weight":0.178311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.150026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.130637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.129884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631867,"sim:weight":0.126878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631544,"sim:weight":0.124284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23935,"sim:weight":0.120823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631690,"sim:weight":0.119902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75980,"sim:weight":0.114368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.108155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80232,"sim:weight":0.105918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222942,"sim:weight":0.103044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.0977824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1644031,"sim:weight":0.097627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.0965335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.0852095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631804,"sim:weight":0.0681911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Patients display progressive motor, cognitive, and behavioural deterioration associated with progressive cell loss and atrophy in the striatum. Currently there are no disease modifying treatments and current symptomatic treatments are only partially effective in the early to moderate stages. Neural transplantation is effective in animal models of HD and offers a potential strategy for brain repair in patients. The authors report a safety study of unilateral transplantation of human fetal striatal tissue into the striatum of four patients with HD. \r\n\r\nSubjects and methods: Stereotaxic placements of cell suspensions of human fetal ganglionic eminence were made unilaterally into the striatum of four patients with early to moderate HD. All patients received immunotherapy with cyclosporin A, azathioprine, and prednisolone for at least six months postoperatively. Patients were assessed for safety of the procedure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regular recording of serum biochemistry and haematology to monitor immunotherapy, and clinical assessment according to the Core Assessment Protocol For Intrastriatal Transplantation in HD (CAPIT-HD). \r\n\r\nResults: During the six month post-transplantation period, the only adverse events related to the procedure were associated with the immunotherapy. MRI demonstrated tissue at the site of implantation, but there was no sign of tissue overgrowth. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the procedure accelerated the course of the disease. \r\n\r\nConclusions: Unilateral transplantation of human fetal striatal tissue in patients with HD is safe and feasible. Assessment of efficacy will require longer follow up in a larger number of patients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rosser, Anne Elizabeth","Barker, Roger A.","Harrower, T.","Watts, C.","Farrington, M.","Ho, A.

In mice, hemizygous deletion of either Tbx1 or Gnb1l can cause deficits in pre-pulse inhibition, a sensory motor gating defect which is associated with schizophrenia. We tested the hypothesis that variation at this locus confers risk of schizophrenia and related disorders in a series of case-control association studies. First we found evidence for a male-specific genotypic association (p\u003d0.00017) TBX1/GNB1L in 662 schizophrenia cases and 1416 controls from the UK. Moreover, we replicated this finding in two independent case control samples (additional 746 cases and 1330 controls) (meta analysis p\u003d1.8x10â€“5) and also observed significant evidence for genotypic association in an independent sample of 480 schizophrenia parent-proband trios from Bulgaria with markers at this locus, which was again strongest in the male probands (p\u003d0.004). Genotyping the most significant SNPs in a sample of 83 subjects with 22q11DS with and without psychosis again revealed a significant allelic association with psychosis in males with 22q11DS (p\u003d0.01). Finally, using allele specific expression analysis we have shown that the markers associated with psychosis are also correlated with alterations in GNB1L expression, raising the hypothesis that the risk to develop psychosis at this locus could be mediated in a dose sensitive manner via gene expression. However, other explanations are possible, and further analyses will be required to clarify the correct functional mechanism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Nigel Melville","Glaser, Beate","Norton, Nadine","Williams, Hywel John","Pierce, Timothy","Moskvina, Valentina","Monks, Stephen","Del Favero, Jurgen","Goossens, Dirk","Rujescu, Dan","Kirov, George","Craddock, Nicholas John","Murphy, Kieran Christopher","O\u0027Donovan, Michael Conlon","Owen, Michael John"],"dc:date":"2007-11-13","doi":"10.1093/hmg","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":70652,"sim:weight":0.500534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":117135,"sim:weight":0.255416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222833,"sim:weight":0.218866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76613,"sim:weight":0.218291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75436,"sim:weight":0.194389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76597,"sim:weight":0.183553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643971,"sim:weight":0.176287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75595,"sim:weight":0.173167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.166495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26783,"sim:weight":0.1648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.155387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77984,"sim:weight":0.149827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631997,"sim:weight":0.148095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.147412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643983,"sim:weight":0.145927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.142158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26759,"sim:weight":0.134395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87207,"sim:weight":0.126699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25913,"sim:weight":0.125965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631602,"sim:weight":0.12026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We examined the role of X-chromosome deficiency on fear reactivity in X-monosomic mice (39,XO), and found that they exhibited anxiogenic behaviour relative to normal females (40,XX). A molecular candidate for this effect is Steroid sulfatase (Sts) as this is located in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the X-chromosome and consequently is normally biallelically expressed. In addition, the steroid sulfatase enzyme (STS) is putatively linked to fear reactivity by an effect on GABAA receptors via the action of neurosteroids. Real-time PCR demonstrated that levels of Sts mRNA were reduced by half in the brains of 39,XO mice compared with 40,XX, and that expression levels of a number of GABAA subunits previously shown to be important components of fear processing (Gabra3, Gabra1 and Gabrg2) were also altered. However, 40,XY*X mice, in which the Y*X is a small chromosome comprising of a complete PAR and a small non-PAR segment of the X-chromosome, exhibited the same pattern of fear reactivity behaviour as 39,XO animals, but equivalent expression levels of Sts, Gabra1, Gabra3 and Gabrg2 to 40,XX females. This showed that although Sts may cause alterations in GABAA subunit expression, these changes do not result in increased fear reactivity. This suggests an alternative X-chromosome gene, that escapes inactivation, is responsible for the differences in fear reactivity between 39,XO and 40,XX mice. These findings inform the TS data, and point to novel genetic mechanisms that may be of general significance to the neurobiology of fear.","bibo:AuthorList":["Isles, Anthony Roger","Davies, William","Burrmann, Doreen","Burgoyne, Paul S.","Wilkinson, Lawrence Stephen"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","doi":"10.1093/hmg","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23870,"sim:weight":0.181584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360880,"sim:weight":0.16152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.134287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76821,"sim:weight":0.134089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87207,"sim:weight":0.131862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75441,"sim:weight":0.130007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76066,"sim:weight":0.129105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.127227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105102,"sim:weight":0.123679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.122067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.121687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.121182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77174,"sim:weight":0.119756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26719,"sim:weight":0.115333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.115261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76351,"sim:weight":0.102597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76149,"sim:weight":0.0829494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The remaining aberrations were validated with Affymetrix 250K SNP arrays or 244K Agilent oligo-arrays and tested for inheritance from the parents. A total of 13 aberrations satisfied our criteria. Two of them are very likely to be pathogenic. The first one is a deletion at 2p16.3 that was present in an affected sibling and disrupts NRXN1. The second one is a de novo duplication at 15q13.1 spanning APBA2. The proteins of these two genes interact directly and play a role in synaptic development and function.

In order to assess the strength of the evidence for linkage and to obtain the best indication of the location of susceptibility genes, we have amalgamated three large samples to give a total of 723 affected relative pairs (ARPs). Multipoint, model-free ARP linkage analysis was performed. Genome-wide significant evidence for linkage was observed on 10q21.2 (LOD\u003d3.3) and genome-wide suggestive evidence was observed on 9q22.33 (LOD\u003d2.5) and 19q13.32 (LOD\u003d2.0). One further region on 9p21.3 was identified with an LOD score\u003e1. We observe no evidence to suggest that more than one locus is responsible for the linkage to 10q21.2, although this linked region may harbour more than one susceptibility gene. Evidence of allele-sharing heterogeneity between the original collection sites was observed on chromosome 9 but not on chromosome 10 or 19. Evidence for an interaction was observed between loci on chromosomes 10 and 19. Where samples overlapped, the genotyping consistency was high, estimated to average at 97.3%.

These receptors facilitate fast-response, inhibitory glycinergic neurotransmission in the brainstem and spinal cord leading to a rapid modification and reduction of the excitatory startle response. Mutations in the ÃŸ-subunit of GlyR (glrb) occur in a murine model of hyperekplexia (spastic), but have not been detected in human hyperekplexia. Following mutation analysis of the human ÃŸ-subunit of hGlyR (GLRB) in a cohort of 22 hyperekplexia patients, we provide evidence to confirm that GLRB mutations can cause human hyperekplexia. A missense (G920A resulting in G229D) and a splice site mutation (IVS5+5G-\u003eA) occurred together in a compound heterozygote with a transient hyperekplexia phenotype. Exon trap analysis revealed that IVS5+5G-\u003eA results in the exclusion of exon 5 from GLRB transcripts. Electrophysiological studies showed reduced sensitivity to agonist mediated activation of the {alpha}1ÃŸ (G229D) GlyR suggesting that GlyR ÃŸ-subunits are not restricted to conferring modulatory influences and maintaining structural integrity, but may also play a functional role in hGlyR ligand binding.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rees, Mark Ian","Lewis, Trevor M.","Kwok, John B.

We report the characterization of several new variants of collybistin, which are created by alternative splicing of exons encoding an N-terminal src homology 3 (SH3) domain and three alternate C termini (CB1, CB2, and CB3). The presence of the SH3 domain negatively regulates the ability of collybistin to translocate gephyrin to submembrane microaggregates in transfected mammalian cells. Because the majority of native collybistin isoforms appear to harbor the SH3 domain, this suggests that collybistin activity may be regulated by protein-protein interactions at the SH3 domain. We localized the binding sites for collybistin and the GlyR {beta} subunit to the C-terminal MoeA homology domain of gephyrin and show that multimerization of this domain is required for collybistin-gephyrin and GlyR-gephyrin interactions. We also demonstrate that gephyrin clustering in recombinant systems and cultured neurons requires both collybistin-gephyrin interactions and an intact collybistin pleckstrin homology domain. The vital importance of collybistin for inhibitory synaptogenesis is underlined by the discovery of a mutation (G55A) in exon 2 of the human collybistin gene (ARHGEF9) in a patient with clinical symptoms of both hyperekplexia and epilepsy. The clinical manifestation of this collybistin missense mutation may result, at least in part, from mislocalization of gephyrin and a major GABAA receptor subtype.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harvey, Kirsten","Duguid, Ian C","Alldred, Melissa J.","Beatty, Sarah E.","Ward, Hamish","Keep, Nicholas H.","Lingenfelter, Sue E.","Pearce, Brian R.","Lundgren, Johan","Owen, Michael John","Smart, Trevor G.","Lüscher, Bernhard","Rees, Mark Ian","Harvey, Robert J."],"dc:date":"2004-06-23","doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1184-04.2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":7223,"sim:weight":0.579043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.194512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.180454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105102,"sim:weight":0.160694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.155613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222900,"sim:weight":0.155131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.153855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76739,"sim:weight":0.14772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76218,"sim:weight":0.135487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76961,"sim:weight":0.133435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266339,"sim:weight":0.121283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76646,"sim:weight":0.120553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75588,"sim:weight":0.10541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75652,"sim:weight":0.0993461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631653,"sim:weight":0.0943637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Preventing the use of feet in violence, and preventing group violence should be major priorities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brennan, Iain Richard","Moore, Simon Christopher","Shepherd, Jonathan Paul"],"dc:date":"2006-12-14","doi":"10.1136/ip.2006.011858","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1632344,"sim:weight":0.287268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77309,"sim:weight":0.229599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222638,"sim:weight":0.221038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.204119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75704,"sim:weight":0.180157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795345,"sim:weight":0.171194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222637,"sim:weight":0.157626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.151741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.14796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76336,"sim:weight":0.138656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222954,"sim:weight":0.137868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52423,"sim:weight":0.126447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76070,"sim:weight":0.124942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77264,"sim:weight":0.119954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25817,"sim:weight":0.114778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631868,"sim:weight":0.113235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.111737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1556644,"sim:weight":0.111307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.101235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2753332,"sim:weight":0.0881197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Previous reports from our laboratory have shown that exogenous interleukin (IL)-15 treatment augments the CD8+ T cell response against the parasite. However, the role of endogenous IL-15 in the proliferation of activated/memory CD8+ T cells during toxoplasma or any other infection is unknown. In this study, we treated T. gondii immune mice with soluble IL-15 receptor α (sIL-15Rα) to block the host endogenous IL-15. The treatment markedly reduced the ability of the immune animals to control a lethal infection. CD8+ T cell activities in the sIL-15Rα–administered mice were severely reduced as determined by IFN-γ release and target cell lysis assays. The loss of CD8+ T cell immunity due to sIL-15Rα treatment was further demonstrated by adoptive transfer experiments. Naive recipients transferred with CD44hi activated/memory CD8+ T cells and treated with sIL-15Rα failed to resist a lethal T. gondii infection. Moreover, sIL-15Rα treatment of the recipients blocked the ability of donor CD44hi activated/memory CD8+ T cells to replicate in response to T. gondii challenge. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the important role of host IL-15 in the development of antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells against an intracellular infection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khan, Imtiaz A.","Moretto, Magali","Wei, Xiao-Qing","Williams, Martha","Schwartzman, Joseph D.","Liew, Foo Y."],"dc:date":"2002-06-03","doi":"10.1084/jem.20011915","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27251,"sim:weight":0.332061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631690,"sim:weight":0.312551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25876,"sim:weight":0.293192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75980,"sim:weight":0.283838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631559,"sim:weight":0.282396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387788,"sim:weight":0.273105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631867,"sim:weight":0.268039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222815,"sim:weight":0.257762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222805,"sim:weight":0.248902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77207,"sim:weight":0.23607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222879,"sim:weight":0.225349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.210805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10887,"sim:weight":0.204808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76322,"sim:weight":0.197305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.192783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631138,"sim:weight":0.192326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.172672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26480,"sim:weight":0.172627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25906,"sim:weight":0.166847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76969,"sim:weight":0.156566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Superimposed on end-replication losses are additional mutational events that result in large-scale changes in telomere length. In order to establish if the dynamics of the XpYp telomere are typical of human telomeres, here we describe an analysis using STELA of the telomeres of 2p, 11q, 12q, 17p and XpYp. The dynamics of telomere loss (erosion rates and stochastic length changes) was conserved among 2p, 11q, 12q and XpYp within the same cell strains and was dependent on the replicative kinetics of the cells in culture. However, of the telomeres analysed, the telomere of 17p was more stable with a striking paucity of large-scale length changes, and exhibited the shortest recorded allelic distribution (300 bp) in senescent cells and displayed a general, but not absolute, trend towards being the shortest telomere. Ectopic over-expression of hTERT homogenized both allelic and chromosome-specific telomeric distributions. However, telomerase-expressing cancer cells displayed both allelic variation and chromosome-specific telomere length, with 17p displaying the shortest allelic telomere length. Although other telomeres in the genome may share the properties of 17p, these data suggest that physiological levels of telomerase allow differential telomere length regulation and indicate the presence of cis-acting factors that govern both telomeric stability and chromosome-specific telomere length in the presence of telomerase.","bibo:AuthorList":["Britt-Compton, Bethan","Rowson, Janet Maud","Locke, Matthew","Mackenzie, Ian","Kipling, David Glyn","Baird, Duncan Martin"],"dc:date":"2006-01-18","doi":"10.1093/hmg","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76159,"sim:weight":0.302927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81234,"sim:weight":0.201584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23870,"sim:weight":0.168356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51733,"sim:weight":0.129451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75980,"sim:weight":0.111721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108070,"sim:weight":0.11136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.101546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76984,"sim:weight":0.0947489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77271,"sim:weight":0.0940788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.0928371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780067,"sim:weight":0.0896792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.083595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77207,"sim:weight":0.0832137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76122,"sim:weight":0.0813399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.0812687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76666,"sim:weight":0.0714995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76242,"sim:weight":0.0713977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75588,"sim:weight":0.0675515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631653,"sim:weight":0.0549978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The frequency of assault related ED attendances were studied relative to whether the national team won or lost, controlling for potential covariates: match attendance, match location (home/away), results (win/lose), net scores, and day of match (weekend/weekday).

Implementation of NICE guidance varied by trust and by topic. Prescribing of some taxanes for cancer (P \u003c 0.002) and orlistat for obesity (P \u003c 0.001) significantly increased in line with guidance. Prescribing of drugs for Alzheimer\u0027s disease and prophylactic extraction of wisdom teeth showed trends consistent with, but not obviously a consequence of, the guidance. Prescribing practice often did not accord with the details of the guidance. No change was apparent in the use of hearing aids, hip prostheses, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, laparoscopic hernia repair, and laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery after NICE guidance had been issued. \r\n\r\nConclusions Implementation of NICE guidance has been variable. Guidance seems more likely to be adopted when there is strong professional support, a stable and convincing evidence base, and no increased or unfunded costs, in organisations that have established good systems for tracking guidance implementation and where the professionals involved are not isolated. Guidance needs to be clear and reflect the clinical context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sheldon, Trevor A.","Cullum, Nicky","Dawson, Diane","Lankshear, Annette Jean","Lowson, Karin","Watt, Ian","West, Peter","Wright, Dianne","Wright, John"],"dc:date":"2004-10-30","doi":"10.1136/bmj.329.7473.999","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.313716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1489065,"sim:weight":0.214082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24379,"sim:weight":0.213215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23113,"sim:weight":0.213215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24404,"sim:weight":0.211399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.199011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.197877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.186139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998613,"sim:weight":0.184523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.184023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25870,"sim:weight":0.180547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75567,"sim:weight":0.172458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24399,"sim:weight":0.171354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8337,"sim:weight":0.153743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.152881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.152015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.147507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.146133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.134671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.13165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The effect in the UK is unknown, as is whether cluster- or patient-randomization would be the most appropriate design for a Phase III clinical trial.\r\nMethod We undertook a Phase II patient-level randomized controlled trial in primary care, nested within a cluster-randomized trial. Depressed participants were randomized to ‘collaborative care’ – case manager-coordinated medication support and brief psychological treatment, enhanced specialist and GP communication – or a usual care control. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression (PHQ-9).\r\nResults We recruited 114 participants, 41 to the intervention group, 38 to the patient randomized control group and 35 to the cluster-randomized control group. For the intervention compared to the cluster control the PHQ-9 effect size was 0.63 (95% CI 0.18–1.07). There was evidence of substantial contamination between intervention and patient-randomized control participants with less difference between the intervention group and patient-randomized control group (−2.99, 95% CI −7.56 to 1.58, p\u003d0.186) than between the intervention and cluster-randomized control group (−4.64, 95% CI −7.93 to −1.35, p\u003d0.008).

These cells were retrogradely labeled directly, following injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the ciliary ganglion, or were transsynaptically labeled following injections of WGA into the vitreous chamber. Almost half of the cells are distributed rostral to the oculomotor nucleus, both in and lateral to the anteromedian nucleus. Of the remaining preganglionic motoneurons, roughly 20% of the total are located dorsal to the oculomotor nucleus. Strikingly few of these neurons are actually found within the Edinger-Westphal nucleus proper. Instead, the majority are found in the adjacent supraoculomotor area or along the midline between the two somatic nuclei. An additional population, roughly 30% of the total, is located ventral to the oculomotor nucleus. This study also provides evidence for a functional subdivision of this preganglionic population. Pupil-related preganglionic motoneurons were transsynaptically labeled by injecting WGA into the anterior chamber, while lens-related preganglionic motoneurons were transsynaptically labeled by injecting WGA into the ciliary muscle. The results suggest that the pupil-related preganglionic motoneurons, that is, those controlling the iris sphincter pupillae muscle, are located rostrally, in and lateral to the anteromedian nucleus. In contrast, lens-related preganglionic motoneurons, that is, those controlling the ciliary muscle are particularly prevalent caudally, both dorsal and ventral to the oculomotor nucleus. Thus, the cat intraocular muscle preganglionic innervation is spatially organized with respect to function, despite the dispersed nature of its distribution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Erichsen, Jonathan Thor","May, Paul J."],"dc:date":"2002-01","doi":"10.1017/S0952523801191029","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":360864,"sim:weight":0.26931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631782,"sim:weight":0.133119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.108035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631955,"sim:weight":0.103348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.102815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80232,"sim:weight":0.100275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631544,"sim:weight":0.0669099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

More recently, it has been shown to be upregulated in human gastric and colorectal cancer. We therefore wished to address the functional importance of SPARC upregulation to intestinal tumorigenesis in vivo. \r\n\r\nMethods: SPARC upregulation was determined in intestinal adenomas of tumour-prone ApcMin/+ mice at both the RNA and the protein level. To determine the functional importance of SPARC for intestinal tumorigenesis we then intercrossed Sparc knockout mice with ApcMin/+ mice (n â€Š\u003dâ€Š 20).

A deficiency of Sparc strongly suppressed adenoma formation in ApcMin/+ mice (pâ‰¥0.0001).

Genetic and epigenetic mutations are found in five different genes which all lie within a 1 Mb imprinted domain on human chromosome 11p15. Only two of these genes, p57KIP2 (CDKN1C) and IGF2, are likely to be functionally involved in this disease. The presence of the additional mutations therefore suggests a role for the regulation of these two genes by distant cis-elements. The mouse Igf2 gene is regulated by enhancers and imprinting elements which lie \u003e120 kb downstream of its promoter. Here we show that key elements for expression of the mouse p57Kip2 (Cdkn1c) gene also lie at a distance. Enhancers for expression within skeletal muscle and cartilage lie \u003e25 kb downstream of the gene. In addition, we find no evidence for allele-specific expression of p57Kip2 (Cdkn1c) from our bacterial artificial chromosome transgenes that span 315 kb around the locus. This suggests that a key imprinting element for p57Kip2 (Cdkn1c) also lies at a distance. Therefore, BWS in humans may result from disruption of appropriate expression of the p57KIP2 (CDKN1C) gene through mutations that occur at a substantial distance from the gene.","bibo:AuthorList":["John, Rosalind Margaret","Ainscough, J.F.","Barton, Sheila.

Entheses from four young volunteers with no history of significant musculoskeletal injury were examined by magnetic resonance imaging using T1 weighted sequences.\r\n\r\nResults: \r\nAdipose tissue was present at several different sites at numerous entheses. Many tendons/ligaments lay on a bed of well vascularised, highly innervated, “insertional angle fat”. Endotenon fat was striking between fascicles, where entheses flared out at their attachments. It was also characteristic of the epitenon, where it occurred in conjunction with lamellated and Pacinian corpuscles. Fat filled, meniscoid folds often protruded into joint cavities, immediately adjacent to attachment sites.\r\n\r\nConclusion: \r\nAdipose tissue is a common feature of normal entheses and should not be regarded as a sign of degeneration. It contributes to the increase in surface area of attachment sites, promotes movement between tendon/ligament and bone, and forms part of an enthesis organ that dissipates stress. The presence of numerous nerve endings in fat at attachment sites suggests that it has a mechanosensory role and this could account for the rich innervation of many entheses. Because damage to fat is known to lead to considerable joint pain, our findings may be important for understanding the site of pain in enthesopathies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Benjamin, Michael","Redman, S.","Milz, S.","Buettner, A.","Amin, A","Moriggl, B.","Brenner, E.","Emery, P.","McGonagle, D.","Bydder, G."],"dc:date":"2004-12-01","doi":"10.1136/ard.2003.019182","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109129,"sim:weight":0.245167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631793,"sim:weight":0.226057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.199612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109023,"sim:weight":0.174081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108529,"sim:weight":0.169508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.145323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108480,"sim:weight":0.144853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108928,"sim:weight":0.141003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27089,"sim:weight":0.134588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.133124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75306,"sim:weight":0.122772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85829,"sim:weight":0.112985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26050,"sim:weight":0.110813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this study, we investigate the role of synovial macrophages and their main proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), in driving osteoarthritis synovitis and influencing the production of other pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, production of matrix metalloproteinases, and expression of aggrecanases in the osteoarthritis synovium. We established a model of cultures of synovial cells from digested osteoarthritis synovium derived from patients undergoing knee or hip arthroplasties. By means of anti-CD14-conjugated magnetic beads, specific depletion of osteoarthritis synovial macrophages from these cultures could be achieved. The CD14+-depleted cultures no longer produced significant amounts of macrophage-derived cytokines like IL-1 and TNF-α. Interestingly, there was also significant downregulation of several cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8 (p \u003c 0.001) and matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 (p \u003c 0.01), produced chiefly by synovial fibroblasts. To investigate the mechanisms involved, we went on to use specific downregulation of IL-1 and/or TNF-α in these osteoarthritis cultures of synovial cells. The results indicated that neutralisation of both IL-1 and TNF-α was needed to achieve a degree of cytokine (IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and matrix metalloproteinase (1, 3, 9, and 13) inhibition, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), similar to that observed in CD14+-depleted cultures. Another interesting observation was that in these osteoarthritis cultures of synovial cells, IL-1β production was independent of TNF-α, in contrast to the situation in rheumatoid arthritis. Using RT-PCR, we also demonstrated that whereas the ADAMTS4 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs 4) aggrecanase was driven mainly by TNF-α, ADAMTS5 was not affected by neutralisation of IL-1 and/or TNF-α. These results suggest that, in the osteoarthritis synovium, both inflammatory and destructive responses are dependent largely on macrophages and that these effects are cytokine-driven through a combination of IL-1 and TNF-α.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bondeson, Jan","Wainwright, Shane Daniel","Lauder, Sarah Nicol","Amos, Nick","Hughes, Clare Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2006-12-19","doi":"10.1186/ar2099","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387637,"sim:weight":0.709627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222879,"sim:weight":0.445001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631559,"sim:weight":0.392863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25878,"sim:weight":0.286141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77287,"sim:weight":0.277192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25881,"sim:weight":0.259376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10887,"sim:weight":0.248922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.22428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75980,"sim:weight":0.217761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76322,"sim:weight":0.21642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.167214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76969,"sim:weight":0.166227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.151942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76548,"sim:weight":0.146355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222891,"sim:weight":0.144804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76079,"sim:weight":0.144537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631602,"sim:weight":0.120328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631804,"sim:weight":0.11645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

HPLC was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. \r\n\r\nResults: When catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/L) the formation of catheter biofilm by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis was prevented.

These results demonstrate that PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling and the expression of antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family are required to sustain the survival of adult sympathetic neurons.","bibo:AuthorList":["Orike, Nina","Middleton, Gayle","Borthwick, Emma","Buchman, Vladimir L.","Cowen, Timothy","Davies, Alun M."],"dc:date":"2001-09-01","doi":"10.1083/jcb.200101068","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":22696,"sim:weight":0.324214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26655,"sim:weight":0.319435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397441,"sim:weight":0.284328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76984,"sim:weight":0.19951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26657,"sim:weight":0.183506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848202,"sim:weight":0.168111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7521,"sim:weight":0.156575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76325,"sim:weight":0.144795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340645,"sim:weight":0.140406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222812,"sim:weight":0.130441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631895,"sim:weight":0.120452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631544,"sim:weight":0.114222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.110597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222810,"sim:weight":0.109918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.107501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.104942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632033,"sim:weight":0.0907859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.0880833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0770946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75588,"sim:weight":0.074364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recent work suggests that neuronal precursors derived from foetal striatum may have a greater capacity than primary foetal striatum to project to the usual striatal target areas such as the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, raising the possibility that they have a greater potential for circuit reconstruction. However, comparing the reconstructive capacity of the two donor cells types is confounded by the fact that many precursor experiments have been carried out in a xenogeneic background in order to utilize species-specific markers for tracking the donor cells, whereas most primary foetal transplant studies have utilized an allograft paradigm. Thus, differences in immunogenic background could influence the findings; for example, xenogeneic grafts may not recognize host inhibitory signals, thereby encouraging more profuse and extensive projections. We have addressed this issue directly by comparing foetal neural precursor and primary foetal grafts in both allo- and xenograft environments using several labelling techniques, including GFP-transgenic mice and LacZ-labelled cells as donor tissue and iontophoretic injection of the anterograde tracers BDA, neurobiotin and PHA-L in the host. We present clear evidence that foetal neural precursors produce grafts with richer axonal outgrowth than primary foetal grafts, and that this is independent of the immunogenic background. Furthermore, both neural precursor and primary grafts derived from human foetal tissue produced a significantly richer outgrowth than do grafts of mouse donor tissue, which may relate to their large final graft volume and the greater intrinsic potential of human CNS neurons for greater axon elongation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kelly, Claire M.","Precious, Sophie Victoria","Penketh, Richard","Amso, Nazar Najib","Dunnett, Stephen Bruce","Rosser, Anne Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2007-03-29","doi":"10.1093/brain","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27416,"sim:weight":0.178422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.150119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.130699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.12995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631867,"sim:weight":0.126956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631544,"sim:weight":0.124331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23935,"sim:weight":0.120897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631690,"sim:weight":0.119976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.108192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80232,"sim:weight":0.105984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222942,"sim:weight":0.103064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.0977975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1644031,"sim:weight":0.0976756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.0965726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.0852622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631804,"sim:weight":0.0682332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Patients display progressive motor, cognitive, and behavioural deterioration associated with progressive cell loss and atrophy in the striatum. Currently there are no disease modifying treatments and current symptomatic treatments are only partially effective in the early to moderate stages. Neural transplantation is effective in animal models of HD and offers a potential strategy for brain repair in patients. The authors report a safety study of unilateral transplantation of human fetal striatal tissue into the striatum of four patients with HD. \r\n\r\nSubjects and methods: Stereotaxic placements of cell suspensions of human fetal ganglionic eminence were made unilaterally into the striatum of four patients with early to moderate HD. All patients received immunotherapy with cyclosporin A, azathioprine, and prednisolone for at least six months postoperatively. Patients were assessed for safety of the procedure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regular recording of serum biochemistry and haematology to monitor immunotherapy, and clinical assessment according to the Core Assessment Protocol For Intrastriatal Transplantation in HD (CAPIT-HD). \r\n\r\nResults: During the six month post-transplantation period, the only adverse events related to the procedure were associated with the immunotherapy. MRI demonstrated tissue at the site of implantation, but there was no sign of tissue overgrowth. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the procedure accelerated the course of the disease. \r\n\r\nConclusions: Unilateral transplantation of human fetal striatal tissue in patients with HD is safe and feasible. Assessment of efficacy will require longer follow up in a larger number of patients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rosser, Anne Elizabeth","Barker, Roger A.","Harrower, T.","Watts, C.","Farrington, M.","Ho, A.

To determine whether this form of potentiation depends on synaptic plasticity, we studied long-term potentiation (LTP) and sensory-evoked potentials in the barrel cortex of -calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)T286A mutant mice. We studied three different forms of LTP induction: theta-burst stimulation, spike pairing, and postsynaptic depolarization paired with low-frequency presynaptic stimulation. None of these protocols produced LTP in CaMKIIT286A mutant mice, although all three were successful in wild-type mice. To study synaptic plasticity in vivo, we measured sensory-evoked potentials in the barrel cortex and found that single-whisker experience selectively potentiated synaptic responses evoked by sensory stimulation of the spared whisker in wild types but not in CaMKIIT286A mice. These results demonstrate that CaMKII autophosphorylation is required for synaptic plasticity in the neocortex, whether induced by a variety of LTP induction paradigms or by manipulation of sensory experience, thereby strengthening the case that the two forms of plasticity are related.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hardingham, Neil Robert","Glazewski, Stanislaw","Pakhotin, Pavel","Mizuno, Keiko","Chapman, Paul Frederick James","Giese, K.

Because the  subunit is highly expressed in the thalamus, we tested whether thalamocortical (TC) neurons of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and ventrobasal complex exhibit tonic inhibition. Focal application of gabazine (GBZ) (50 µM) revealed the presence of a 20 pA tonic current in 75 and 63% of TC neurons from both nuclei, respectively. No tonic current was observed in GABAergic neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT). Bath application of 1µM GABA increased tonic current amplitude to 70 pA in 100% of TC neurons, but it was still not observed in NRT neurons. In dLGN TC neurons, the tonic current was sensitive to low concentrations of the  subunit-specific receptor agonists allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (100 nM) and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]-pyridin-3-ol (THIP) (100 nM) but insensitive to the benzodiazepine flurazepam (5 µM). Bath application of low concentrations of GBZ (25–200 nM) preferentially blocked the tonic current, whereas phasic synaptic inhibition was primarily maintained. Under intracellular current-clamp conditions, the preferential block of the tonic current with GBZ led to a small depolarization and increase in input resistance. Using extracellular single-unit recordings, block of the tonic current caused the cessation of low-threshold burst firing and promoted tonic firing. Enhancement of the tonic current by THIP hyperpolarized TC neurons and promoted burst firing. Thus, tonic current in TC neurons generates an inhibitory tone. Its modulation contributes to the shift between different firing modes, promotes the transition between different behavioral states, and predisposes to absence seizures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cope, David W.","Hughes, Stuart W.","Crunelli, Vincenzo"],"dc:date":"2005-12-01","doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3362-05.2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"D W Cope, S W Hughes and V Crunelli.

In inhibitory neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT), this rhythm is reflected as a slow (\u003c1 Hz) oscillation of the membrane potential comprising stereotypical, recurring \"up\" and \"down\" states. Here we show that reducing the leak current through the activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) with either trans-ACPD [(+/–)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid] (50–100 µM) or DHPG [(S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine] (100 µM) instates an intrinsic slow oscillation in NRT neurons in vitro that is qualitatively equivalent to that observed in vivo. A slow oscillation could also be evoked by synaptically activating mGluRs on NRT neurons via the tetanic stimulation of corticothalamic fibers. Through a combination of experiments and computational modeling we show that the up state of the slow oscillation is predominantly generated by the \"window\" component of the T-type Ca2+ current, with an additional supportive role for a Ca2+-activated nonselective cation current. The slow oscillation is also fundamentally reliant on an Ih current and is extensively shaped by both Ca2+- and Na+-activated K+ currents. In combination with previous work in thalamocortical neurons, this study suggests that the thalamus plays an important and active role in shaping the slow (\u003c1 Hz) rhythm during deep sleep.","bibo:AuthorList":["Blethyn, Kate L.","Hughes, Stuart Wynn","Tóth, Tibor Istvan","Cope, David W.","Crunelli, Vincenzo"],"dc:date":"2006-03-01","doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3607-05.2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69759,"sim:weight":0.258852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76477,"sim:weight":0.188371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85188,"sim:weight":0.185787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85649,"sim:weight":0.18524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84795,"sim:weight":0.177165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85179,"sim:weight":0.170656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76105,"sim:weight":0.141131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107090,"sim:weight":0.140813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85566,"sim:weight":0.140198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.138885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631920,"sim:weight":0.136925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584828,"sim:weight":0.113377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.108737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75717,"sim:weight":0.102556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.0954946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75996,"sim:weight":0.0839841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Ceramide is known to play a dual role in collagen gene regulation, with the effect of ceramide on collagen promoter activity being dependent on its concentration. Treatment of cells with low doses of sphingomyelinase produces small increases in endogenous ceramide. We investigated whether ceramide influences articular chondrocyte matrix homeostasis and, if so, the role of PKR in this process. Bovine articular chondrocytes were stimulated for 7 days with sphingomyelinase to increase endogenous levels of ceramide. To inhibit PKR, 2-aminopurine was added to duplicate cultures. De novo sulphated glycosaminoglycan and collagen synthesis were measured by adding [35S]-sulphate and [3H]-proline to the media, respectively. Chondrocyte phenotype was investigated using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Over 7 days, sphingomyelinase increased the release of newly synthesized sulphated glycosaminoglycan and collagen into the media, whereas inhibition of PKR in sphingomyelinase-treated cells reduced the level of newly synthesized sulphated glycosaminoglycan and collagen. Sphingomyelinase treated chondrocytes expressed col2a1 mRNA, which is indicative of a normal chondrocyte phenotype; however, a significant reduction in type II collagen protein was detected. Therefore, small increments in endogenous ceramide in chondrocytes appear to push the homeostatic balance toward extracellular matrix synthesis but at the expense of the chondrocytic phenotype, which was, in part, mediated by PKR.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gilbert, Sophie Jane","Blain, Emma Jane","Jones, Pamela","Duance, Victor Colin","Mason, Deborah Jane"],"dc:date":"2006-05-12","doi":"10.1186/ar1961","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929810,"sim:weight":0.318083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25878,"sim:weight":0.205387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25881,"sim:weight":0.181563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631795,"sim:weight":0.16221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.156027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104778,"sim:weight":0.155202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.142424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0989167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.0915308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75818,"sim:weight":0.0857112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76066,"sim:weight":0.0852749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77174,"sim:weight":0.0810465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75441,"sim:weight":0.0796591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75804,"sim:weight":0.0778113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631544,"sim:weight":0.0761807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The photosynthetic communities consist of cyanobacteria within the surface fabric of the stromatolite, and surface eukaryotic microalgae (e.g. diatoms and chlorophytes). Due to the turbulent environment, stromatolites are often buried for periods of weeks or months as a result of sand wave movements. We investigated the tolerance of subsets of the photosynthetic communities in stromatolites to natural burial processes. Variable chlorophyll fluorescence was used to monitor PSII quantum efficiency and fluorescence kinetics during and after artificial and natural in situ burial. Excavated samples with an intact cyanobacterial community, but lacking surface microalgae, reactivated their quantum efficiency when exposed to both low light and oxygen. Reactivation, indicated by an increase in photochemical efficiency (ΔF/Fm), occurred after 7 to 9 d and 14 to 16 d of natural burial, although reactivation was slower with longer burial. Changes in fluorescence yields indicated that probable state transitions occurred, and we suggest that some form of oxygen dependent process(es) and light were in part responsible for the re-establishment of photochemistry. These processes effectively ‘kick start’ electron transport, and hence protect against photodamage induced by exposure to light after burial. In contrast to the prokaryotic cyanobacterial mats, mats with surface communities dominated by diatoms did not have high tolerance to burial. Two out of 3 samples of diatom mats failed to reactivate after 7 d of burial. The greater ability of cyanobacteria to survive week to month long periods of burial may be an important factor in accounting for the importance of these prokaryotes in stromatolite construction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Perkins, Rupert Gordon","Kromkamp, Jacco C.","Reid, R.

The records include the two largest abrupt (\u003c1 Myr) increases in the Cenozoic benthic oxygen isotope record: Oi-1 in the earliest Oligocene (?34 Ma) and Mi-1 in the earliest Miocene (?23 Ma). The paired Mg/Ca and oxygen isotope records are used to calculate seawater ?18O (?w). Calculated ?w suggests that a large Antarctic ice sheet formed during Oi-1 and subsequently fluctuated throughout the Oligocene on both short (\u003c0.5 Myr) and long (2–3 Myr) timescales, between about 50 and 100% of its maximum earliest Oligocene size. The magnitudes of these fluctuations are consistent with estimates of sea level derived from sequence stratigraphy. The transient expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet at Mi-1 is marked in the benthic ?18O record by two positive excursions between 23.7 and 22.9 Ma, each with a duration of 200–300 kyr. Bottom water temperatures decreased by ?2°C over the 150 kyr immediately prior to both rapid ?18O excursions. However, the onset of each of these phases of ice growth is synchronous, within the resolution of the records, with the onset of a 2°C warming over ?150 kyr. We suggest that the warming during these glacial expansions reflect increased greenhouse forcing prompted by a sudden decrease in global chemical weathering rates as Antarctic basement silicate rocks became blanketed by an ice sheet. This represents a negative feedback process that might have operated during major abrupt growth phases of the Antarctic ice sheet.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lear, Caroline Helen","Rosenthal, Y.","Coxall, Helen Kathrine","Wilson, P.

Core KC073 is from a sediment drift at the mouth of the Falkland Trough and contains sediments from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to present, dated using radiocarbon dates on bulk organic matter and radiolarian stratigraphy. The site lies along the path of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and immediately downstream of where North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is entrained into the ACC. Significant variations in ocean conditions are reflected in high-amplitude changes in diatom concentrations and assemblage composition. The diatom assemblage at the LGM indicates that winter sea ice extent was at least 5° farther north than present until at least 19.0 ka (calendar years) and summer sea ice may have occasionally extended over the site, but for the most part it lay to the south. During deglaciation, Chaetoceros resting spores (CRS) dominate the diatom assemblage with valve concentrations in excess of 500 × 106 valves per gram. Submillennial-scale variations in the numbers of CRS and Thalassiosira antarctica occur throughout the late deglacial and dominate the changes in diatom concentration. We propose that the influx of CRS is controlled by the flow of NADW over the Falkland Plateau. As such our data provide unique evidence that NADW impacted on this sector of the Southern Ocean during deglaciation. During the Holocene the sedimentation rate dramatically reduced. We suggest that the ACC flow increased over the site and inhibited settling and winnowed the surface sediments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allen, Claire S.","Pike, Jennifer","Pudsey, Carol J.","Leventer, Amy"],"dc:date":"2005-06-01","doi":"10.1029/2004PA001055","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23780,"sim:weight":0.351649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5838512,"sim:weight":0.307651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29763,"sim:weight":0.287826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85714,"sim:weight":0.283077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108098,"sim:weight":0.275748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65128,"sim:weight":0.265006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490161,"sim:weight":0.261214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5838516,"sim:weight":0.260808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52449,"sim:weight":0.25824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27962,"sim:weight":0.257692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108474,"sim:weight":0.254576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000679,"sim:weight":0.250375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24791,"sim:weight":0.248955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268392,"sim:weight":0.243296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9592510,"sim:weight":0.228729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1398389,"sim:weight":0.221517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":265138,"sim:weight":0.217797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1491012,"sim:weight":0.207037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85146,"sim:weight":0.203418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":662457,"sim:weight":0.20298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These results show that deep\r\nsedimentary prokaryotes can have high activity, have changing\r\ndiversity associated with interfaces and are active over geological\r\ntimescales.","bibo:AuthorList":["Parkes, Ronald John","Webster, Gordon","Cragg, Barry Andrew","Weightman, Andrew John","Newberry, Carole Janice","Ferdelman, Timothy G.","Kallmeyer, Jens","Jorgensen, Bo B.","Aiello, Ivano W.","Fry, John Christopher"],"dc:date":"2005-07-21","doi":"10.1038/nature03796","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.267477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23841,"sim:weight":0.237021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29438,"sim:weight":0.167741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28941,"sim:weight":0.135874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28151,"sim:weight":0.122716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27270,"sim:weight":0.118813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000162,"sim:weight":0.115697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Existence of a permanent benthic fluff layer in the Black Sea basin is suggested, acting as a geochemical transition layer within which all sedimentary particles are hydraulically sorted and particles subject to dissolution or organic remineralization are altered prior to accumulation. We propose that particle residence time within the benthic fluff layer is a key factor in determining sedimentary microfabric and geochemical composition of laminated unit I sediments. We present a schematic model depicting the above relationships and use it to propose a paleoflux scenario for laminae formation in the unit II sapropel.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pilskaln, Cynthia H.","Pike, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","doi":"10.1029/1999PA000469","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9001888,"sim:weight":0.245991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29452,"sim:weight":0.238967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29763,"sim:weight":0.196454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.195916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66553,"sim:weight":0.191608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29439,"sim:weight":0.190589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29438,"sim:weight":0.17822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000162,"sim:weight":0.171297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68665,"sim:weight":0.164735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108838,"sim:weight":0.162645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29443,"sim:weight":0.148207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24637,"sim:weight":0.147498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":675935,"sim:weight":0.146536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33657,"sim:weight":0.14176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85001,"sim:weight":0.137556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26683,"sim:weight":0.125685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108098,"sim:weight":0.125372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108439,"sim:weight":0.123417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23780,"sim:weight":0.121141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84223,"sim:weight":0.113815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Three heating modes are studied: internal heating, bottom heating across core-mantle boundary, and both combined. For each heating mode, layers were investigated centered at depths from 500 km to 2500 km in 500 km steps and with Δρ from 1 to 5% in 1% steps. We did not find stable layering for Δρ of 1%. Cases with no bottom heating were stable with Δρ of 2%, but Δρ of at least 3% were required by cases with a component of bottom heating. All cases with Δρ of 4% or more were stable. We found that the stability of the layer is strongly dependent on the buoyancy ratio B (B \u003d Δρ ÷ ραΔT, where Δρ is the chemical density increase across the boundary, ρ is the density in the upper layer, α is the thermal expansivity and ΔT is the radial temperature difference across the whole system) with a dense layer becoming unstable B ≈ 0.5. We characterize the height and length scale of the undulations and the area of the interface. Deformations of the interface are largest for cases in which interface is in the midmantle and for cases with small density contrasts. We find that the heating mode does not affect the thermal structure of the layered system, which can be explained with energy balance considerations. The amplitude of the interfacial deformation is found to be unaffected by the heating mode and can be predicted using B. Our results suggest the interfacial thermal boundary layers require large temperature contrasts; therefore the lack of evidence for thermal boundary layers in global seismology studies between 500 and 2500 km depth suggests interfaces at these depths are unlikely.","bibo:AuthorList":["Oldham, David N.","Davies, John Huw"],"dc:date":"2004-12-31","doi":"10.1029/2003GC000603","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2303828,"sim:weight":0.297177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23605,"sim:weight":0.247234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26000,"sim:weight":0.233484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29461,"sim:weight":0.210507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66282,"sim:weight":0.209086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109191,"sim:weight":0.192335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76637,"sim:weight":0.180428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29436,"sim:weight":0.177508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2284472,"sim:weight":0.176557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26713,"sim:weight":0.165559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66281,"sim:weight":0.161177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26933,"sim:weight":0.15945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108347,"sim:weight":0.150799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.134692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27271,"sim:weight":0.109228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using a highly sensitive four-wave mixing technique, we measure the polarization decay in the temperature range from 5 to 120 K on nine samples having the energy distance from the dot ground-state transition to the wetting layer continuum (confinement energy) tuned from 332 to 69 meV by thermal annealing. The width and the weight of the zero-phonon line in the homogeneous line shape are inferred from the measured polarization decay and are discussed within the framework of recent theoretical models of the exciton-acoustic phonon interaction in quantum dots. The weight of the zero-phonon line is found to decrease with increasing lattice temperature and confinement energy, consistently with theoretical predictions by the independent Boson model. The temperature-dependent width of the zero-phonon line is well reproduced by a thermally activated behavior having two constant activation energies of 6 and 28 meV, independent of confinement energy. Only the coefficient to the 6-meV activation energy shows a systematic increase with increasing confinement energy. These findings rule out that the process of one-phonon absorption from the excitonic ground state into higher energy states is the underlying dephasing mechanism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Borri, Paola","Langbein, Wolfgang Werner","Woggon, U.","Stavarache, V.","Reuter, D.","Wieck, A.

These techniques often fail in the presence of noise nonstationarities by incorrectly identifying such transients as possible gravitational-wave bursts. Furthermore, consistency tests currently used to try to eliminate these noise transients are not applicable to general networks of detectors with different orientations and noise spectra. In order to address this problem we introduce a fully coherent consistency test that is robust against noise nonstationarities and allows one to distinguish between gravitational-wave bursts and noise transients in general detector networks.

Most algorithms designed to date are based on the unrealistic assumption that the detector noise may be modeled as a stationary Gaussian process. However most experiments exhibit a non-Gaussian “tail” in the probability distribution. This “excess” of large signals can be a troublesome source of false alarms. This article derives an optimal (in the Neyman-Pearson sense, for weak signals) signal processing strategy when the detector noise is non-Gaussian and exhibits tail terms. This strategy is robust, meaning that it is close to optimal for Gaussian noise but far less sensitive than conventional methods to the excess large events that form the tail of the distribution. The method is analyzed for two different signal analysis problems: (i) a known waveform (e.g., a binary inspiral chirp) and (ii) a stochastic background, which requires a multi-detector signal processing algorithm. The methods should be easy to implement: they amount to truncation or clipping of sample values which lie in the outlier part of the probability distribution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allen, Bruce","Creighton, Jolien D.E.","Flanagan, Éanna É.","Romano, Joseph David"],"dc:date":"2002-06-01","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.65.122002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631516,"sim:weight":0.245928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54114,"sim:weight":0.234753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26814,"sim:weight":0.188254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795328,"sim:weight":0.150525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this analytic approach the physics involved in this generating process is more transparent. Consequently, the effects due to various elements of physics can be isolated easily. In solving the equation for evolution of RGW in the expanding universe, both the sudden transition and the WKB approximation for the scale factor during the radiation-matter transition have been taken. To describe more precisely the decoupling process, we have introduced an analytic expression for the visibility function, consisting of two pieces of half-Gaussian curves. We also include the damping on polarizations due to the photon diffusion up to the second order of the tight coupling. Analytic polarization spectra ClXX have been obtained with the following several improvements over the previous results. 1. The approximate analytic result is quite close to the numerical one evaluated from the cmbfast code, especially, for the first three peaks of the spectrum that are observable. By using the analytic exact solution of RGW in the sudden transition approximation, we have demonstrated the dependence of ClXX on the dark energy and the baryons. 2. Our analytic half-Gaussian approximation of the visibility function fits better than the usual Gaussian model, and its time integration yields an analytic damping factor, which is parameter-dependent. This improves the spectra by ?30% around the second and third peaks. 3. The second order of tight coupling reduces the overall amplitude of ClXX by 58%, comparing with the tight-coupling limit. 4.

This kind of quintom field can be separated into two kinds: the hessence model, which has the state of ?12\u003e?22, and the hantom model with the state ?12\u003c?22. We discuss the evolution of these models in the ?-?? plane (? is the state equation of the dark energy, and ?? is its time derivative in units of Hubble time), and find that according to ?\u003e-1 or \u003c-1, and the potential of the quintom being climbed up or rolled down, the ?-?? plane can be divided into four parts. The late time attractor solution, if existing, is always quintessencelike or ?-like for hessence field, so the big rip does not exist. But for hantom field, its late time attractor solution can be phantomlike or ?-like, and sometimes, the big rip is unavoidable. Then we consider two special cases: one is the hessence field with an exponential potential, and the other is with a power law potential. We investigate their evolution in the ?-?? plane. We also develop a theoretical method of constructing the hessence potential function directly from the effective equation-of-state function ?(z). We apply our method to five kinds of parametrizations of equation-of-state parameter, where ? crossing -1 can exist, and find they all can be realized.

We show that the appearance of well-pronounced dips in the transmission spectra of a PCS is due to the interaction with resonant waveguide eigenmodes in the slab. The energy position and width of the dips in transmission provide information on the frequency and inverse radiative lifetime of the quasiguided eigenmodes. We calculate the energies, linewidths, and electromagnetic fields of such quasiguided eigenmodes, and analyze their symmetry and optical activity. The electromagnetic field in such modes is resonantly enhanced, which opens possibilities for use in creating resonant enhancement of different nonlinear effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tikhodeev, Sergei G.","Mulyarov, Egor","Yablonskii, A.

Using data spanning more than two complete orbits of the system, we detect evidence for tidally induced non-radial oscillations on the surface of GP Vel, apparent as peaks in the power spectrum of the residuals to the radial velocity curve fit. By removing the effect of these oscillations (to first order) and binning the radial velocities, we have determined the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve of GP Vel to be  km s -1. Given the accurately measured semi-amplitude of the pulsar\u0027s orbit, the mass ratio of the system is . We are able to set upper and lower limits on the masses of the component stars as follows. Assuming GP Vel fills its Roche lobe then the inclination angle of the system, i, is  . In this case we obtain the masses of the two stars as  for the neutron star and  for GP Vel. Conversely, assuming the inclination angle is , the ratio of the radius of GP Vel to the radius of its Roche lobe is  and the masses of the two stars are  and . A range of solutions between these two sets of limits is also possible, corresponding to other combinations of i and . In addition, we note that if the zero phase of the radial velocity curve is allowed as a free parameter, rather than constrained by the X-ray ephemeris, a significantly improved fit is obtained with an amplitude of  km s -1 and a phase shift of  in true anomaly. The apparent shift in the zero phase of the radial velocity curve may indicate the presence of an additional radial velocity component at the orbital period. This may be another manifestation of the tidally induced non-radial oscillations and provides an additional source of uncertainty in the determination of the orbital radial velocity amplitude.","bibo:AuthorList":["Quaintrell, H.","Norton, A.

Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 73, 163â€“179 (1997)] have derived exact sampling localization results for the determination of elastic moduli from (exact) storage and loss moduli. It is now shown how their results can be exploited to construct simple and explicit moving-average formulae which recover estimates of the relaxation spectrum from oscillatory shear data, with realistic observational errors. Explicit moving-average formulae are presented which experimentalists can apply immediately to appropriately sampled oscillatory shear measurements. The given formulae are validated on noisy data obtained from synthetic relaxation spectra.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Arthur Russell","Anderssen, R.

It is based on direct numerical simulations of the complete linearized Navierâ€“Stokes equations obtained with the novel velocityâ€“vorticity method described in Davies \u0026 Carpenter (2001). As the equations are linear, they become separable with respect to the azimuthal coordinate, $\\theta$. This permits us to simulate a single azimuthal mode. Impulse-like excitation is used throughout. This creates disturbances that take the form of wavepackets, initially containing a wide range of frequencies. When the real spatially inhomogeneous flow is approximated by a spatially homogeneous flow (the so-called parallel-flow approximation) the results ofthe simulations are fully in accordance with the theory of Lingwood (1995). If the flow parameters are such that her theory indicates convective behaviour the simulations clearly exhibit the same behaviour. And behaviour fully consistent with absolute instability is always found when the flow parameters lie within the theoretical absolutely unstable region. The numerical simulations of the actual inhomogeneous flow reproduce the behaviour seen in the experimental study of Lingwood (1996). In particular, there is close agreement between simulation and experiment for the ray paths traced out by the leading and trailing edges of the wavepackets. In absolutely unstable regions the short-term behaviour of the simulated disturbances exhibits strong temporal growth and upstream propagation. This is not sustained for longer times, however. The study suggests that convective behaviour eventually dominates at all the Reynolds numbers investigated, even for strongly absolutely unstable regions. Thus the absolute instability of the rotating-disc boundary layer does not produce a linear amplified global mode as observed in many other flows. Instead the absolute instability seems to be associated with transient temporal growth, much like an algebraically growing disturbance. There is no evidence of the absolute instability giving rise to a global oscillator. The maximum growth rates found for the simulated disturbances in the spatially inhomogeneous flow are determined by the convective components and are little different in the absolutely unstable cases from the purely convectively unstable ones. In addition to the study of the global behaviour for the usual rigid-walled rotating disc, we also investigated the effect of replacing an annular region of the disc surface with a compliant wall. It was found that the compliant annulus had the effect of suppressing the transient temporal growth in the inboard (i.e. upstream) absolutely unstable region. As time progressed the upstream influence of the compliant region became more extensive.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Christopher","Carpenter, Peter W."],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","doi":"10.1017/S0022112003004701","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":89711,"sim:weight":0.401843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31441,"sim:weight":0.398449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27631,"sim:weight":0.363769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30420,"sim:weight":0.354632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23553,"sim:weight":0.342139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24687,"sim:weight":0.33628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26767,"sim:weight":0.327863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31804,"sim:weight":0.323494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28873,"sim:weight":0.314502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81429,"sim:weight":0.285235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23896,"sim:weight":0.281736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8335,"sim:weight":0.253349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268054,"sim:weight":0.253228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2309348,"sim:weight":0.236489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30664,"sim:weight":0.234844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.231154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631632,"sim:weight":0.222308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268060,"sim:weight":0.218837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27227,"sim:weight":0.200667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26766,"sim:weight":0.196079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For comparison, the same alloy was used to deposit films on CuBe substrate. The change in boron concentration from 3% to 10% in the electrolyte promoted the amorphous phase in the films on the CuBe substrate and a partial amorphous phase in the nanowires. Thermal treatment of the deposited films and nanowire arrays at 600?°C promoted recrystallization. Magnetic hysteresis loops for 100 and 200?nm nanowire arrays are “wasp waisted.” There is no evidence of a sharp reversal for the out-of-plane or in-plane hysteresis loops, just a smooth curve indicating a coherent rotation during the magnetization reversal. Annealing the 200?nm nanowire array at 600?°C for 1?h gives rise to a mixed hysteresis loop, which can be attributed to competing domain configurations. An alternative explanation for this behavior is that there might be a phase separation between Fe, Ni, and Co in the nanowire environment due to the short range ordering of the alloy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vieyra, Malini","Meydan, Turgut","Borza, Firuta"],"dc:date":"2007-05-01","doi":"10.1063/1.2711700","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1559979,"sim:weight":0.477005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1562287,"sim:weight":0.335829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.331734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26638,"sim:weight":0.323277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11252,"sim:weight":0.265322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26706,"sim:weight":0.254209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77094,"sim:weight":0.240549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.226533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631529,"sim:weight":0.216274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844718,"sim:weight":0.212244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26711,"sim:weight":0.196441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.196335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567785,"sim:weight":0.189515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631735,"sim:weight":0.188826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567228,"sim:weight":0.184379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26735,"sim:weight":0.177917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.177278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632041,"sim:weight":0.167288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.14855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84831,"sim:weight":0.14626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Mössbauer spectroscopy provides an excellent tool for probing the local environment of the Fe atoms present in such materials. Results show two sets of six-line hyperfine patterns for all samples, indicating the presence of Fe in both A and B sites. Identification of sites is accomplished by evidence from hyperfine distribution width, integrated intensity, and isomer-shift data. Increasing Mn concentration was found to decrease the hyperfine field strength at both sites, but at unequal rates, and to increase the distribution width. This effect is due to the relative strengths of Fe–O–X superexchange (X \u003d Fe, Co, or Mn) and the different numbers of the next-nearest neighbors of A and B sites. Results are consistent with a model of Mn substituting into B sites and displacing Co ions onto A sites.","bibo:AuthorList":["Krieble, K.","Schaeffer, T","Paulsen, J. A.","Ring, A. P.","Lo, C.

Major magnetic hysteresis loops were measured for each sample at temperatures over the range 10–400 K, using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. The high-field regimes of the hysteresis loops were modeled using the law of approach to saturation equation, based on the assumption that at sufficiently high field only rotational processes remain, with an additional forced magnetization term that was linear with applied field. The cubic anisotropy constant K1 was calculated from the fitting of the data to the theoretical equation. It was found that anisotropy increases substantially with decreasing temperature from 400 to 150 K, and decreases with increasing Mn content. Below 150 K, it appears that even under a maximum applied field of 5 T, the anisotropy of CoFe2O4 and CoMn0.2Fe1.8O4 is so high as to prevent complete approach to saturation, thereby making the use of the law of approach questionable in these cases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Melikhov, Yevgen","Snyder, John Evan","Jiles, David C","Ring, A.

Elastic recoil detection analysis has shown the presence of excess nitrogen in state-of-the-art InN films. Using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction it is shown that two distinct forms of point defects can be distinguished; one of these appears to be an interstitial form of nitrogen, common in some forms of polycrystalline InN. The other is associated with a combined biaxial and hydrostatic strain observed for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown films, and may be a mixture of the nitrogen-on-metal antisite defect and lower densities of indium vacancies and interstitial nitrogen. The high density of defects present in all the InN samples examined suggests that stoichiometry related point defects dominate the electrical and optical properties of the material. The difference in the type of point defect observed for polycrystalline (rf sputtered) and epitaxial (MBE and CVD) InN supports existing evidence that the Moss-Burstein effect is not an adequate description of the apparent band-gap difference between InN samples grown by different techniques.","bibo:AuthorList":["Butcher, K S A","Fernandes, A J","Chen, P P T","Wintrebert -Fouquet, M","Timmers, H","Shrestha, S K","Hirshy, Hassan","Perks, Richard Marc"],"dc:date":"2007-06-15","doi":"10.1063/1.2736654","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631529,"sim:weight":0.222716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176856,"sim:weight":0.198119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109080,"sim:weight":0.188628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108788,"sim:weight":0.185781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12226,"sim:weight":0.17699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76750,"sim:weight":0.176279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631735,"sim:weight":0.166982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84924,"sim:weight":0.160838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26619,"sim:weight":0.157776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85937,"sim:weight":0.15288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108299,"sim:weight":0.147517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222993,"sim:weight":0.141268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1594217,"sim:weight":0.140238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108050,"sim:weight":0.138408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.13828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108874,"sim:weight":0.132882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108676,"sim:weight":0.131127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Fuel cells, converters based on miniaturized gas turbines, and other systems under intensive study, give rise to diverse practical difficulties. Thermoelectric devices are robust, durable and have no moving parts, but tend to be exceedingly inefficient. We propose regenerative combustion systems which mitigate this impediment and are likely to make high performance small-scale thermoelectric power generation applicable in practice.

Finally, the Eshelby formula to calculate the strain energy in the presence of the interface effect is given.","bibo:AuthorList":["Duan, Huiling","Karihaloo, Bhushan Lal","Wang, J.","Yi, X."],"dc:date":"2006-11-17","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevB.74.195328","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108134,"sim:weight":0.184051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84285,"sim:weight":0.169644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316488,"sim:weight":0.125214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.121471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105084,"sim:weight":0.121188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.118646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27120,"sim:weight":0.105353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11977,"sim:weight":0.104953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85751,"sim:weight":0.10491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77146,"sim:weight":0.104545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109340,"sim:weight":0.102971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26656,"sim:weight":0.0987941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75460,"sim:weight":0.0937925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.0918101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23890,"sim:weight":0.0907069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.0858774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26027,"sim:weight":0.0851759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.0787113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631735,"sim:weight":0.0769419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Full coupling is made possible by use of a novel differential deflection formulation. The way in which the differential deflection is incorporated into the overall solution method for a point contact is discussed. A range of spatial and temporal discretization methods are incorporated and compared. The method is validated under transient conditions by a detailed comparison with published work produced using a different, independent method incorporating a moving roughness feature.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the results with different discretization methods leads to the conclusion that spatial central differencing with a Crank-Nicolson temporal discretization is the most effective finite difference scheme, and this is generally equivalent to the finite element discretization given in detail in the paper. A comparison of the results produced for moving rough surfaces suggests that the finite element formulation is preferred.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holmes, Mark James Andrew","Evans, Henry Peredur","Hughes, Timothy Giffin","Snidle, Raymond Walter"],"dc:date":"2003-08-01","doi":"10.1243/135065003768618641","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316058,"sim:weight":0.24893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.210067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316060,"sim:weight":0.177922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76807,"sim:weight":0.176462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26309,"sim:weight":0.172828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66739,"sim:weight":0.151332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222992,"sim:weight":0.145318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26015,"sim:weight":0.141376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108096,"sim:weight":0.134976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27099,"sim:weight":0.131756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108653,"sim:weight":0.125834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.123998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26027,"sim:weight":0.104989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76748,"sim:weight":0.0827288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631875,"sim:weight":0.0772294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The development of these models from a number of different sources has meant that the engineer now has a choice to make when undertaking creep and shrinkage prediction and it is difficult to know which is best suited for this purpose. Some are considerably more complex than others requiring greater amounts of input focusing on material data, concrete properties, environmental conditions, specimen geometry and loading conditions. The study reported here focuses on the sensitivity to change, in both the short term and over time, of the individual parameters that comprise the input and whether one model is more appropriate in any given situation. It has been found that for each model certain parameters are more sensitive than others. It is suggested that for any given model, the parameters that do not reflect the expected behaviour when changed counterbalance each other, cancelling out any errors. This further suggests that when deciding on which model to use when predicting shrinkage and creep strains it is prudent to look at the specific conditions that prevail, assess the relevant input parameters for which data are available, assess the sensitivity level of each of these parameters and then make a decision as to the most appropriate model to use.","bibo:AuthorList":["Howells, R.

Comparisons are also included showing the elastohydrodynamic response of the tooth contacts at different times in the meshing cycle for one of the load stages. The rheological model adopted is based on Ree-Eyring non-Newtonian shear thinning, and comparisons are also included of models having constant and different pressure-dependent specifications of the Eyring shear stress parameter 0. Parameters obtained from the micro EHL analyses are presented that quantify the degree of adversity experienced by the surfaces in elastohydrodynamic contact. These quantify extreme pressure behavior, extreme proximity of surfaces, and pressure cycling within the overall contact and indicate that the different fluid models considered lead to significantly different pressure and film thickness behavior within the contact","bibo:AuthorList":["Tao, Jiwen","Hughes, Timothy Giffin","Evans, Henry Peredur","Snidle, Raymond Walter","Hopkinson, N A","Talks, M.","Starbuck, J.

This is significantly aided by the use of a Moog 2000 programmable servo controller (PSC) to equalize the extending and retracting flow gains of the servovalve in the Lotus actuator control loop, justifying the use of combined extending and retracting transient data for parameter identification. This then allows the system equations to be developed using linear state-space theory, and a suitable form is proposed for further design studies.

It is proposed to explain the phenomenon by a statistically self-similar variation of the pattern of relatively sharp nanometer-scale asperities of the films.","bibo:AuthorList":["Borodich, Feodor M.","Harris, Stephen J.","Keer, Leon M."],"dc:date":"2002-10-01","doi":"10.1063/1.1519099","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.195532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631735,"sim:weight":0.179628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631638,"sim:weight":0.129297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28352,"sim:weight":0.127183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26522,"sim:weight":0.125989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.122237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108311,"sim:weight":0.120548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27122,"sim:weight":0.11915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.118738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.118738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27099,"sim:weight":0.113137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25850,"sim:weight":0.111824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77335,"sim:weight":0.109251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.108614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109199,"sim:weight":0.107569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108653,"sim:weight":0.0959977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.0944875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109115,"sim:weight":0.0911371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26482,"sim:weight":0.0805504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108322,"sim:weight":0.0666712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The asymmetric elongated contact that typifies worm gears is non-Hertzian and is treated using a novel three-dimensional elastic contact simulation technique. The kinematic conditions at the EHL contact are such that the surfaces have a slide-roll ratio equal to almost 2, and the sliding direction varies over the contact area. These considerations require a non-Newtonian, thermal analysis, and the appropriate form of a novel Reynolds equation is developed that can incorporate any form of the non-Newtonian relationship between shear stress and strain rate. A form that incorporates both limiting shear stress and Eyring shear thinning is utilized in which the two effects can be included both singly or together.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sharif, Khairi","Kong, S.","Evans, Henry Peredur","Snidle, Raymond Walter"],"dc:date":"2001-07-24","doi":"10.1243/0954406011524171","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.248088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31657,"sim:weight":0.237757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58487,"sim:weight":0.23742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631798,"sim:weight":0.198763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24739,"sim:weight":0.198614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25850,"sim:weight":0.195141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76807,"sim:weight":0.190179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26309,"sim:weight":0.187116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27099,"sim:weight":0.17612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.172087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77180,"sim:weight":0.172016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222992,"sim:weight":0.148194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76176,"sim:weight":0.133742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26027,"sim:weight":0.112256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We measured femoral strength in adult transgenic growth-retarded rats as a model of GHD. Long-term, moderate GHD was accompanied by endocrine and morphometric changes consistent with a significant reduction in femoral strength.\r\n\r\nIntroduction: Childhood growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is associated with osteopenia, but little is known about its effects on subsequent adult bone strength and fracture risk.\r\n\r\nMaterials and Methods: We have therefore measured femoral strength (failure load measured by three-point bending) in a new model of moderate GHD, the transgenic growth-retarded (Tgr) rat at 15, 22–23, and 52 weeks of age, and have quantified potential morphological and endocrine determinants of bone strength.\r\n\r\nResults: Skeletal growth retardation in Tgr rats was accompanied by a sustained reduction in the anterior-posterior diameter of the femoral cortex, whereas mid-diaphyseal cortical wall thicknesses were largely unaltered. Total femoral strength was significantly impaired in Tgr rats (p \u003c 0.01), and this impairment was more pronounced in males than females. Compromised bone strength in Tgr rats could not be accounted for by the reduction in mechanical load (body weight) and was not caused by impairment of the material properties of the calcified tissue (ultimate tensile stress), despite marked reductions in femoral mineral density (areal bone mineral density; p \u003c 0.001). Microcomputerized tomographical analysis revealed significant modification of the architecture of trabecular bone in Tgr rats, with reductions in the number and thickness of trabeculae (p \u003c 0.05) and in the degree of anisotropy (p \u003c 0.01). The marked reduction in plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 in Tgr rats was accompanied by the development of high circulating leptin levels (p \u003c 0.01).\r\n\r\nConclusion: These results show that the changes in endocrinology and bone morphology associated with long-term moderate GHD in Tgr rats are accompanied by changes consistent with a significant reduction in the threshold for femoral fracture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Evans, Bronwen A.

Most of the injuries to older people and children under five occur at home. Many people are encouraged to alter their home to try and reduce injury and injury risk. Common alterations include the fitting of locks on cupboards, installing stair gates, improvement of lighting in halls and stairways, and the removal of trip hazards. The review found that there is insufficient evidence from studies to show that such changes reduce the number of injuries in the home but does not conclude that these interventions are ineffective. Home alterations need to be evaluated by larger and better designed studies which include injuries in their outcomes.\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nInjury in the home is common, accounting for approximately a third of all injuries. The majority of injuries to children under five and people aged 75 and older occur at home. Multifactorial injury prevention interventions have been shown to reduce injuries in the home. However, few studies have focused specifically on the impact of physical adaptations to the home environment and the effectiveness of such interventions needs to be ascertained.\r\nObjectives\r\n\r\nTo determine the effect of modifications to the home environment on the reduction of injuries due to environmental hazards.\r\nSearch strategy\r\n\r\nWe searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other specialised databases. We also scanned conference proceedings and reference lists. We contacted the first author of all included randomised controlled trials. The searches were last updated to the end of December 2009, and were not restricted by language or publication status.\r\nSelection criteria\r\n\r\nRandomised controlled trials.\r\nData collection and analysis\r\n\r\nTwo authors screened all abstracts for relevance, outcome and design. Two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data from each eligible study. We performed meta-analysis to combine effect measures, using a random-effects model. We assessed heterogeneity using an I2 statistic and a Chi2 test.\r\nMain results\r\n\r\nWe found 28 published studies and one unpublished study. Only two studies were sufficiently similar to allow pooling of data for statistical analyses. Studies were divided into three groups; children, older people and the general population/mixed age group. None of the studies focusing on children or older people demonstrated a reduction in injuries that were a direct result of environmental modification in the home. One study in older people demonstrated a reduction in falls and one a reduction in falls and injurious falls that may have been due to hazard reduction. One meta-analysis was performed which examined the effects on falls of multifactorial interventions consisting of home hazard assessment and modification, medication review, health and bone assessment and exercise (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.23).\r\nAuthors\u0027 conclusions\r\n\r\nThere is insufficient evidence to determine whether interventions focused on modifying environmental home hazards reduce injuries. Further interventions to reduce hazards in the home should be evaluated by adequately designed randomised controlled trials measuring injury outcomes. Recruitment of large study samples to measure effect must be a major consideration for future trials. Researchers should also consider using factorial designs to allow the evaluation of individual components of multifactorial interventions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, Samantha","Arthur, Geri","Lyons, Ronan Anthony","Weightman, Alison Lesley","Mann, Mala K.","Jones, Sarah J.","John, Ann","Lannon, Simon Charles"],"dc:date":"2003-10-18","doi":"10.1002/14651858.CD003600.pub2","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.287238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.248307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.241727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223134,"sim:weight":0.234295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.233491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.217629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780059,"sim:weight":0.21698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632014,"sim:weight":0.202006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.197287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75310,"sim:weight":0.180168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632064,"sim:weight":0.179102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632065,"sim:weight":0.179102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631335,"sim:weight":0.16823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25872,"sim:weight":0.166967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.163041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77305,"sim:weight":0.160761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75620,"sim:weight":0.155156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These weaknesses are illustrated through a first time analysis of variations in management reform values and actions in local government. The empirical results indicate that management reform values and actions are contingent and vary between organizational members. In particular, service managers (first-line supervisors) responsible for implementing management reform actions offer more multifaceted explanations than senior executives. Prior research drawing evidence from single senior executive informants was unable to identify such variations; consequently, it is suggested that the results of this work need to be treated with caution. This study concludes that the empirical reality of management reform research is in need of further and more sophisticated methodologies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walker, Richard Mark","Enticott, Gareth Paul"],"dc:date":"2004-07-01","doi":"10.1093/jopart","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77815,"sim:weight":0.245656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77949,"sim:weight":0.22854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77222,"sim:weight":0.224026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75350,"sim:weight":0.212548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631103,"sim:weight":0.202145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77189,"sim:weight":0.199858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.197513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106931,"sim:weight":0.182165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.177911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.161399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76953,"sim:weight":0.120617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study shows that strategy content is a subset of generally accepted management functions in public organizations. The article then proceeds to test the strategic management concepts in a large, multiyear sample of public organizations.

There is discussion of some recent debates on the social and political context of state social work and child protection in particular. The authors then consider, in turn, the experience of children, parents and social workers in the child protection system. There is also a consideration of partnership and rights. The conclusion is that opportunities for statutory child protection to be liberating are limited, but that there is more potential than the most pessimistic accounts might allow. Rather than libertarian child protection, social workers can aim for child protection practice that is respectful. The paper concludes with some principles for respectful practice, based on the ideas of Richard Sennett. Most importantly, Sennett’s ideas recognise the importance of relationships in social welfare and acknowledge the context of inequality within which social work takes place.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holland, Sarah Anne Louise","Scourfield, Jonathan Bryn"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","doi":"10.1093/bjsw","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":341025,"sim:weight":0.434869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.402416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77112,"sim:weight":0.354747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54492,"sim:weight":0.354589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654845,"sim:weight":0.335017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.282911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76300,"sim:weight":0.276249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.259867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.23311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.231799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.23106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77455,"sim:weight":0.227941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.220127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Case of Family Group Conferences in Child Welfare","bibo:abstract":"This article discusses the potential of family group conferences to act as a liberating intervention for families traditionally controlled by the state welfare system. Family group conferences are interventions designed to remove control of decision making from professionals and allow family groups to make decisions about the welfare of one or more of their members. Using data from a qualitative evaluation of family group conferences in Wales, this article examines ‘imposed empowerment’ and social control, and the feasibility of treating ‘the family’ as a unit for state intervention. The authors propose that the family group conference approach not only has the potential to shift the balance of power between the state and client families, but that it may have the potential to democratise decision making within families. However, it is also noted that such interventions can be seen to be maintaining social control through subtle and possibly unintentional means. The article engages with sociological research and theory on democracy in the family.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holland, Sarah Anne Louise","Scourfield, Jonathan Bryn","O\u0027Neill, Sean Stephen","Pithouse, Andrew Joseph"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","doi":"10.1017/S0047279404008268","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.326925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58509,"sim:weight":0.307113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.277159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.252706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.252706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.241821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.239503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654845,"sim:weight":0.238176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.229066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.212083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.21104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631615,"sim:weight":0.206875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108900,"sim:weight":0.194887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.186647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Measures were completed by 4314 children. Analysis was conducted at the group (school) level, with each school representing one group.\r\n\r\nResults Deprivation was positively associated with breakfast skipping and consumption of ‘unhealthy’ items (i.e. sweet snacks, crisps) for breakfast. A significant negative association was found between deprivation and consumption of ‘healthy’ items (i.e. fruit, bread, cereal, milk). Deprivation was significantly inversely associated with attitudes towards eating breakfast. The relationships between deprivation and (1) breakfast skipping and (2) consumption of ‘healthy’ items for breakfast were mediated by attitudes towards eating breakfast. The hypothesis that attitudes mediated the relationship between deprivation and consumption of ‘unhealthy’ breakfast items was unsupported.\r\n\r\nConclusions Deprivation is associated with adverse breakfast eating behaviours amongst children aged 9–11 years, in terms of breakfast skipping and the quality of breakfasts consumed. Socio-economic differences in attitudes towards eating breakfast are apparent amongst this age group, and appear to relate to social gradients in breakfast eating behaviours. Research is needed to examine the causal nature of these trends and to elucidate factors underlying the development of socio-economic differences in eating-related cognitions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, Graham","Tapper, Katy Anne","Murphy, Simon","Lynch, Rebecca Jayne","Raisanen, Lawrence Matthew","Pimm, Claire Elizabeth","Moore, Laurence Anthony Russell"],"dc:date":"2007-06-01","doi":"10.1017/S1368980007699558","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1393402,"sim:weight":0.247202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76455,"sim:weight":0.194582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74707,"sim:weight":0.164286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5224163,"sim:weight":0.16274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75341,"sim:weight":0.158388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222949,"sim:weight":0.138832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76196,"sim:weight":0.13485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75581,"sim:weight":0.127459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929822,"sim:weight":0.119617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60467,"sim:weight":0.114909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.11182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76934,"sim:weight":0.105524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316090,"sim:weight":0.105202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108088,"sim:weight":0.0928585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26489,"sim:weight":0.0671307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Fos levels were measured after rats had been placed in a novel room and allowed to run up and down preselected arms of a radial maze. An additional control group showed that in normal rats, this exposure to a novel room leads to a Fos increase in a number of structures, including the anterior thalamic nuclei and hippocampus. In contrast, rats with anterior thalamic lesions were found to have significantly less Fos-positive cells in an array of sites, including the hippocampus (dorsal and ventral), retrosplenial cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and prelimbic cortex. These results show that anterior thalamic lesions disrupt multiple limbic brain regions, producing hypoactivity in sites associated in rats with spatial memory. Because many of the same sites are implicated in memory processes in humans (e.g., the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex), this hypoactivity might contribute to diencephalic amnesia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jenkins, Trisha Anne","Dias, Rebecca","Amin, Eman","Brown, Malcolm W.","Aggleton, John Patrick"],"dc:date":"2002-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":360880,"sim:weight":0.236362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645775,"sim:weight":0.223566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84371,"sim:weight":0.214726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848171,"sim:weight":0.189354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":361076,"sim:weight":0.180602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108100,"sim:weight":0.156403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76305,"sim:weight":0.142376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.135718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.120804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643975,"sim:weight":0.113171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631955,"sim:weight":0.109849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87207,"sim:weight":0.107028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.100747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.0995205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394447,"sim:weight":0.0935069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It has been suggested that the phonological representations associated with early words are under-specified, with detail being added either as required to distinguish more words as a child’s vocabulary increases, or as a function of the amount of exposure a child has had to a particular word. We report on an inter-modal preferential looking task in which 48, 18- and 24-month-olds heard either accurate pronunciations of picture names or slight (1- or 2-feature) mispronunciations. Each child was tested on four words that they learned at a very young age, and four words they had learned only recently relative to the test session. Across all children, 30 different words were tested. Analysis of children’s looking behavior found differences between their responses to accurate and inaccurate pronunciations. These results show that toddlers’ representations for words have enough detail to detect even slight mispronunciations. This ability was unaffected by their age, the size of their receptive vocabulary, the neighborhood density of individual test words, or the recency with which words had been learned. The results suggest that the specificity of lexical representations may be unrelated to any of these factors, at least within the range of ages and word familiarity examined in this study.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bailey, Todd M.","Plunkett, Kim"],"dc:date":"2002-04-01","doi":"10.1016/S0885-2014","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85106,"sim:weight":0.368245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85047,"sim:weight":0.346879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75510,"sim:weight":0.329155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631773,"sim:weight":0.278426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1144954,"sim:weight":0.254436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76905,"sim:weight":0.219388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74947,"sim:weight":0.21556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108964,"sim:weight":0.201869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733696,"sim:weight":0.187205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.186773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76428,"sim:weight":0.185368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631801,"sim:weight":0.183585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.153272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This predicts that lesions of the BLA will not produce a decrement in performance in conditioning procedures based on the formation of associations between the sensory aspects of neutral events but will interfere with conditioning based on associations between neutral cues and motivationally significant events. This prediction is supported by the evidence that BLA lesions were without effect on a sensory preconditioning procedure (experiment 1A) that used neutral cues but that BLA lesions did significantly impair representation-mediated conditioning (experiment 1B) when the target cues were motivationally significant at the time of training. These results demonstrate that animals with lesions of the BLA can represent the sensory aspects of neutral events but not the sensory aspects of motivationally significant events.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dwyer, Dominic M.","Killcross, Andrew Simon"],"dc:date":"2006-08-01","doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1647-06.2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631900,"sim:weight":0.154708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66900,"sim:weight":0.139558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.138124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.131367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.113241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.112086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.104861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76111,"sim:weight":0.10409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26514,"sim:weight":0.103845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26757,"sim:weight":0.0959048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76668,"sim:weight":0.0893726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85300,"sim:weight":0.0882207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108964,"sim:weight":0.0782636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At the behavioral level, the transgenic mice showed a progressive reduction in spontaneous locomotion and an increased response to amphetamine.

Functional imaging and electrophysiological data have provided evidence of functional dysconnectivity, but it is unclear whether this reflects an underlying problem with anatomical connectivity. This study used diffusion tensor imaging to examine the integrity of the major white matter fasciculi, which connects the frontal and temporal-parietal cortices, and the corpus callosum in patients with schizophrenia. Method: A 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner was used to acquire diffusion tensor images giving whole brain coverage at an isotropic 2.5-mm voxel size. Fractional anisotropy was measured in 33 patients with schizophrenia and 40 healthy comparison subjects with an automated voxel-based method of analysis. Results: There was reduced fractional anisotropy in patients with schizophrenia in regions corresponding to the superior longitudinal fasciculi bilaterally and in the genu of the corpus callosum. However, within the patient group, the propensity to experience auditory hallucinations was associated with relatively increased fractional anisotropy in superior longitudinal fasciculi and in the anterior cingulum. Conclusions: Schizophrenia is associated with altered white matter integrity in the tracts connecting the frontal cortex with the temporal and parietal cortices and with the contralateral frontal and temporal lobes. The severity of these changes may vary with the pattern of symptoms associated with the disorder. Abstract Teaser","bibo:AuthorList":["Shergill, Sukhwinder S..","Kanaan, Richard A.

To examine whether sensitization of dopaminergic systems leads to a more rapid transition from action–outcome processes to S-R habits, we examined performance of amphetamine-sensitized rats in an instrumental devaluation task. Animals were either sensitized (7 d, 2 mg/kg/d) before training (experiment 1) or sensitized between training and testing (experiment 2). Rats were trained to press a lever for a reward (three sessions) and were then given a test of goal sensitivity by devaluation of the instrumental outcome before testing in extinction. Control animals showed selective sensitivity to devaluation of the instrumental outcome. However, amphetamine sensitization administered before training caused the animals’ responding to persist despite the changed value of the reinforcer. This deficit resulted from an inability to use representations of the outcome to guide behavior, because a reacquisition test confirmed that all of the animals had acquired an aversion to the reinforcer. In experiment 2, post-training sensitization did not disrupt normal goal-directed behavior. These findings indicate that amphetamine sensitization leads to a rapid progression from goal-directed to habit-based responding but does not affect the performance of established goal-directed actions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Killcross, Andrew Simon","Nelson, Andrew John Dudley"],"dc:date":"2006-04-01","doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4305-05.2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109108,"sim:weight":0.21043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26514,"sim:weight":0.208214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85972,"sim:weight":0.181621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87235,"sim:weight":0.165213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86113,"sim:weight":0.161176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.149863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26676,"sim:weight":0.145683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645588,"sim:weight":0.143346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.137221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733696,"sim:weight":0.126746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.125115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76111,"sim:weight":0.102058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.0883777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Rats with pretraining lesions to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or specific lesions to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were trained and tested on a novel behavioral procedure measuring aspects of cue and response competition typical of tests of prefrontal function in humans. Rats were trained on two biconditional discrimination tasks, one auditory and one visual, in two discriminably different contexts. At test, they received presentations of audiovisual compounds of these training stimuli in both contexts, in extinction. These compounds were formed in such way that the individual elements had dictated either the same (congruent trials) or different (incongruent trials) responses during training. Sham-operated rats used the contextual cues to disambiguate the conflicting response information provided by incongruent stimulus compounds. ACC lesions impaired the contextual control of instrumental responding during incongruent cues during only the initial period of cue presentation, whereas larger PFC lesions abolished incongruent cue performance completely. Neither biconditional discrimination acquisition, nor test performance during congruent stimulus compounds, were affected by the lesions. These findings are consistent with human and nonhuman primate studies, indicating a role for the PFC in the processes by which cues come to control behavior in the face of conflicting information and the ACC specifically in processes such as detection of response conflict. This procedure provides a good foundation for an improved understanding of the disruption to goal-directed behavior seen with frontal dysfunction in a number of neuropsychological disorders including schizophrenia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haddon, Josephine Elizabeth","Killcross, Andrew Simon"],"dc:date":"2006-03-01","doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3243-05.2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.230541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.216526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.213398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.213398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.206753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.206753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.204938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.201089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84371,"sim:weight":0.199155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75275,"sim:weight":0.197804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86113,"sim:weight":0.194793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.194602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.194602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75956,"sim:weight":0.187585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.164624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109165,"sim:weight":0.164013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76845,"sim:weight":0.16203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66900,"sim:weight":0.158928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76111,"sim:weight":0.155438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.15474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Rats with either selective, neurotoxic mammillary body lesions or discrete mammillothalamic tract lesions were tested on various spatial working memory tasks. Tests using the T-maze, radial-arm maze, and water maze were manipulated to compare three possible theories of mammillary body function by increasing proactive interference, increasing retention interval, and taxing the rapid processing of novel spatial stimuli. On T-maze alternation and radial-arm maze tasks, both lesion groups were initially impaired but seemed to recover. Transfer tests revealed, however, a more permanent change in performance, suggesting a failure to use distal (allocentric) cues. Consistent with this, both groups were also impaired at matching-to-place in the water maze and showed little improvement with practice. Nevertheless, once the lesion groups had been trained on a task, they were not affected differentially either by an increase of proactive interference or by retention intervals of up to 30 min. Although both mammillary body and mammillothalamic tract lesions resulted in similar impairments, the mammillothalamic tract group was the more affected when acquiring new spatial information. Together, these results suggest that mammillary body damage causes an encoding deficit when learning new spatial tasks, resulting in a suboptimal mode of performance, which may reflect a loss of directional heading information.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vann, Seralynne Denise","Aggleton, John Patrick"],"dc:date":"2003-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108100,"sim:weight":0.178884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":361076,"sim:weight":0.176536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.169248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.167879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.159936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.159936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.159516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.159516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108964,"sim:weight":0.159295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.159264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222824,"sim:weight":0.155965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.154103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.154103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76305,"sim:weight":0.15152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69993,"sim:weight":0.145667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.141427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85300,"sim:weight":0.139569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76668,"sim:weight":0.139225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631619,"sim:weight":0.132857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643975,"sim:weight":0.127535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this study, we took advantage of the isogenic nature of inbred strains of mice to determine the contribution of genes to impulsive behaviors by examining the performance of four separate mouse strains in a novel murine delayed-reinforcement paradigm, during which the animals had to choose between rewards that were relatively small but available immediately and larger but progressively delayed rewards. To control for maternal effects, all the mice were cross-fostered to a common strain immediately after birth. Under these conditions, we found significant differences between the strains on behaviors indexing impulsive choice and on independent measures of locomotor activity, which subsequent heritability analysis showed could be related, in part, to genetic effects. Moreover, the two aspects of behavior were found to co-vary, with the more active animals also displaying more impulsive behavior. This was not attributable to mundane confounds related to individual task requirements but instead indicated the existence of common genetic factors influencing variation in both impulsivity and locomotor activity. The data are discussed in terms of the coexistence of impulsivity and hyperactivity, interactions between environmental and genetic effects, and possible candidate genes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Isles, Anthony Roger","Humby, Trevor","Walters, Eurof","Wilkinson, Lawrence Stephen"],"dc:date":"2004-07-28","doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1650-04.2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.314622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66187,"sim:weight":0.228677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87207,"sim:weight":0.191841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929418,"sim:weight":0.191107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.188255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.187426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316186,"sim:weight":0.173522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26759,"sim:weight":0.162188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733696,"sim:weight":0.15785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.154328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.153865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76111,"sim:weight":0.144846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.144756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77281,"sim:weight":0.140963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26616,"sim:weight":0.140224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.138878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631528,"sim:weight":0.137528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108980,"sim:weight":0.135528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631901,"sim:weight":0.133609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.117681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In these disorders, tau becomes aberrantly phosphorylated, leading to the development of filamentous neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Here we report, in a longitudinal ageing study, the sensorimotor and cognitive assessment of transgenic mice expressing the human tauV337M (‘Seattle Family A’) FTDP-17 mutation, which we have previously shown to demonstrate abnormalities in brain tau phosphorylation. The data indicated highly specific effects of transgene expression on the ability to withhold responding in a murine version of the 5-choice serial reaction time task, behaviour consistent with deficits in impulse control. Ageing exacerbated these effects. In young tauV337M mice, increased impulsivity was present under task conditions making inhibition of premature responding more difficult (longer inter-trial intervals) but not under baseline conditions. However, when older, the tauV337M mice showed further increases in premature responding, including under baseline conditions. These impulse control deficits were fully dissociable from sensorimotor or motivation effects on performance. The findings recapitulate core abnormalities in impulsive responding observed in both frontal variant FTD and FTDP-17 linked to the tauV337M mutation in humans.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lambourne, Sarah L.","Humby, Trevor","Isles, Anthony Roger","Emson, Piers C.","Spillantini, Maria G.","Wilkinson, Lawrence Stephen"],"dc:date":"2007-07-01","doi":"10.1093/hmg","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.182112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733696,"sim:weight":0.173882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.160665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.158231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23935,"sim:weight":0.155469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86857,"sim:weight":0.15146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87207,"sim:weight":0.144202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.142454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.14055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75899,"sim:weight":0.133244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.126959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76111,"sim:weight":0.120294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.120036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.112318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77281,"sim:weight":0.0978347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26759,"sim:weight":0.0961956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.0901815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.0801739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

PG were demonstrated using cuprolinic blue, and the proteins ig-h3, TN-C, fibrillin, and fibronectin were immunolocalised with rabbit anti-ig-h3, mouse anti-TN-C (BC10 and TN2), mouse anti-fibrillin-1 (MAB2502), mouse anti-fibrillin (MAB1919), and rabbit anti-fibronectin by using a standard immunogold technique.\r\nRESULTS Epithelial cells contained numerous vacuoles. Epithelial folds and large, electron lucent subepithelial bullae were present. Basal lamina was thickened and traversed by disrupted anchoring filaments. In the stroma, interfibrillar collagen spacing was increased and abnormally large PG were present. Descemet\u0027s membrane (DM) contained lucent spaces in which there were small filaments. Keratocyte and endothelial cells contained melanin granules. A posterior collagenous layer (PCL) contained numerous microfilaments and wide spacing collagen fibres with a periodicity of 100 nm. Large quantities of abnormal PG were observed at the endothelial face of the PCL. Very strong labelling with ig-h3 antibody was observed in the basement membrane, Bowman\u0027s layer, stroma, DM, and PCL, but not in keratocytes and endothelial cells. Strong labelling with BC10 and TN2 was seen below the epithelium, in electron lucent spaces where the hemidesmosomes were absent, in the fibrotic pannus, in parts of Bowman\u0027s layer, the stroma, and Descemet\u0027s membrane. Labelling with BC10 was stronger and more evenly distributed than with TN2. Fibrillin-1 (MAB2502) and fibrillin (MAB1919) labelling was similar to TN-C labelling. Fibrillin (MAB1919) labelling was stronger than fibrillin-1 (MAB2502) labelling.\r\nCONCLUSIONS Immunoelectron microscopy showed precise labelling of proteins at both the cellular and the subcellular level. Expression of proteins ig-h3, TN-C, fibrillin, and fibronectin was highly increased compared with normal cornea. In the oedematous stroma, increased collagen fibril separation may facilitate a wider distribution of some soluble proteins, such as ig-h3, throughout stroma. The modified expression of the proteins studied in these cases of BK may be regarded as part of an injury response.","bibo:AuthorList":["Akhtar, S.","Bron, A.","Hawksworth, N.","Bonshek, Richard E.","Meek, Keith"],"dc:date":"2001-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.169063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.126324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.12079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":659755,"sim:weight":0.115959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76848,"sim:weight":0.112966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222984,"sim:weight":0.1115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.109971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929817,"sim:weight":0.10566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631669,"sim:weight":0.10212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929888,"sim:weight":0.0983502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.097174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1644031,"sim:weight":0.0960822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0940907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.0929952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631793,"sim:weight":0.0916076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643987,"sim:weight":0.0869882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76548,"sim:weight":0.086088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75539,"sim:weight":0.0793565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76943,"sim:weight":0.0781411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205864,"sim:weight":0.061548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A recent abstract suggests that the coil can affect the eye by decreasing visual acuity, increasing intraocular pressure, and damaging the corneal and conjunctival surface. Such findings, if repeated in all subjects, would cast doubt on the credibility of the search coil as a reliable investigative technique. The aim of this study was to reassess the effect of the scleral search coil on visual function.\r\nMETHODS Six volunteer subjects were selected to undergo coil wear and baseline measurements were taken of logMAR visual acuity, non-contact tonometry, keratometry, and slit lamp examination. Four drops of 0.4% benoxinate hydrochloride were instilled before insertion of the lens by an experienced clinician. The lens then remained on the eye for 30 minutes. Measurements of the four ocular health parameters were repeated after 15 and 30 minutes of lens wear. The lens was then removed and the health of the eye reassessed.\r\nRESULTS No obvious pattern of change was found in logMAR visual acuity, keratometry, or intraocular pressure. The lens did produce changes to the conjunctival and corneal surfaces, but this was not considered clinically significant.\r\nCONCLUSION Search coils do not appear to cause any significant effects on visual function. However, thorough prescreening of subjects and post-wear checks should be carried out on all coil wearers to ensure no adverse effects have been caused.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murphy, Paul","Duncan, A.L.","Glennie, A.J.","Knox, P.

Proteoglycans were visualised using cuprolinic blue dye; and ÃŸig-h3 and keratan sulphate were detected by immunoelectron microscopy. \r\n\r\nResults: The epithelial cells were degenerate and contained apoptotic nuclei. Proteoglycans were present in epithelial cells, intercellular spaces, and in swollen desmosomes. An abnormally large quantity of proteoglycans was present throughout the stroma. Keratocytes throughout the stroma had no cell organelles, were vacuolated, and contained a large quantity of abnormal proteoglycans. Labelling for ÃŸig-h3 was intense around electron lucent spaces in stroma. No labelling was seen in keratocytes or endothelial cells. In normal cornea, keratan sulphate labelling was regular throughout the stroma. In MLS VI type B cornea, keratan sulphate labelling was weak in the anterior stroma but very intense in the posterior stroma and in keratocyte lysosomes and vacuoles. \r\n\r\nConclusion: A deficiency of aryl sulfatase B results in the deposition of keratan sulphate proteoglycan and other proteoglycans in lysosomes, causing the death of keratocytes and an abnormal build-up of proteoglycans in the stroma. This might be responsible for the lateral aggregation of collagen fibrils and impaired fibrillogenesis in MLS VI. Degenerate swollen keratocytes, together with gross changes in epithelial, stromal, and endothelial cells, would be expected to increase light scattering significantly in these corneas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Akhtar, Saeed","Tullo, Andrew B., 1951-","Caterson, Bruce","Davies, Janet R.","Bennett, Kelly","Meek, Keith Michael Andrew"],"dc:date":"2002-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":659755,"sim:weight":0.239455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76969,"sim:weight":0.127811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76548,"sim:weight":0.114491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.106197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1644031,"sim:weight":0.100461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631793,"sim:weight":0.100269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.0925792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631669,"sim:weight":0.0895429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76943,"sim:weight":0.0855733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0849153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.0742019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77174,"sim:weight":0.0715266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Some handsearching was carried out, reference lists were scanned and experts in the field were contacted.  28 research studies of professionally led libraries for healthcare staff, including clinical librarian projects, met the inclusion criterion of at least one health or \u0027time saved\u0027 outcome.  Papers were critically appraised using internationally accepted criteria.  Data were extracted and results were summarised using a narrative format since the studies were heterogeneous and precluded a statistical analysis.\r\n \r\nResults: There is evidence of impact from both traditional and clinical librarian services.  The higher quality studies of traditional services measured impacts of 37-97% on general patient care, 10-31% on diagnosis, 20-51% on choice of tests, 27-45% on choice of therapy and 10-19% on reduced length of stay.  Four studies of clinical librarian projects suggested that professionals saved time as a result of clinical librarian input, and two of these studies showed evidence of cost-effectiveness.  However, the clinical librarian studies were generally smaller, with poorer quality standards.   \r\n\r\nConclusions:  Research studies suggest that professionally-led library services have an impact on health outcomes for patients and may lead to time savings for health care professionals.   The available studies vary greatly in quality but the better quality studies also suggest positive impacts.   Good practice can be gathered from these studies to guide the development of a pragmatic survey for library services that includes the direct effects for patients among the outcome measures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Weightman, Alison Lesley","Williamson, Jane"],"dc:date":"2005-03","doi":"10.1111/j.1471-1842.2005.00549.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.317953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.315966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.281466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76674,"sim:weight":0.275431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25869,"sim:weight":0.269637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.261489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.26112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77003,"sim:weight":0.260124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75002,"sim:weight":0.241688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25872,"sim:weight":0.23525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.235054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.231458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75310,"sim:weight":0.230864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75567,"sim:weight":0.229059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.219881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76413,"sim:weight":0.21928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.21052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54903,"sim:weight":0.206789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.169907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25871,"sim:weight":0.168691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the UK the Government has strongly pushed for a significant increase in the use of renewable energy for electricity generation with only very modest success, nearly 3% coming from this source at present, predominantly hydro and wind. Subsidy for the early tranches of these systems came from an elevated price for generated electricity, but since attempts at price convergence with that pertaining with conventional fossil fuel generation systems has occurred the number of biomass systems being constructed and their net generating capacity has not increased in line with other technologies. Although utilisation technologies exist, and are well proven technologically in Scandinavia, when translated to markets such as the UK, give generating costs which are not competitive with other forms of renewable energy. Problems have arisen with many systems, being predominantly due to fouling/slagging, the different nature of the fuels, and elevated moisture content.\r\nIn this context this paper describes an EU sponsored programme of work to develop a simple cyclone gasifier and combustor which can produce a medium calorific fuel gas for materials such as sawdust, retain up to about 80% of the total ash/residues in the system, and fire simple, low cost gas turbines for power generation. The system is shown to have a very wide operating range and can handle sawdust with significant quantities of material up to 4mm in size, whilst tolerating significant variation in moisture content and capturing very significant quantities of the ash/particulate matter as well as volatile species.","bibo:AuthorList":["Syred, Nicholas","Fick, Wolfgang","Syred, Caroline","Griffiths, Anthony John"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":386659,"sim:weight":0.362247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5842847,"sim:weight":0.331871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76812,"sim:weight":0.328355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107078,"sim:weight":0.306516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176817,"sim:weight":0.252232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107056,"sim:weight":0.242862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":116975,"sim:weight":0.22857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":116782,"sim:weight":0.213104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An integral ash removal system is incorporated into the combustor to reduce the need for subsequent hot gas or other cleanup systems. The combustor is of cyclonic design with tangential inlets for air, start-up fuel and gasification products. Flame stability for low calorific value gases can be enhanced via the use of ceramic/refractory lined sections if required, with the system operating under lean combustion at all times to minimise NOx. Pressure drop of the cyclonic system is minimised by the use of a tangential outlet, as are combustion instabilities, as large central recirculation zones are avoided and associated instabilities like the precessing vortex core. \r\nAsh removal from the system is important to minimise damage to turbine components. Two regions are used for particle removal. The first is the base of the unit of a conventional hopper design, and the other, a unique vortex collector pocket (VCP) carefully positioned by the tangential off-take to take advantage of the accelerating tangential flow into the off-take.\r\nThis paper focuses on the use of CFD to optimise the combustion performance of the combustor run under different operating conditions as well as the removal of coarse and fine material from the flow.","bibo:AuthorList":["Syred, Caroline","Griffiths, Anthony John","Syred, Nicholas"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":107078,"sim:weight":0.246228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.220522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631635,"sim:weight":0.204869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75909,"sim:weight":0.204337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107056,"sim:weight":0.174876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75596,"sim:weight":0.169715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":116975,"sim:weight":0.16127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85046,"sim:weight":0.156561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":116782,"sim:weight":0.154847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386070,"sim:weight":0.143298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

First, a remarkably simple experimentally observed power-law relationship between the abrasion rate of the coatings and the number of cycles is described. This relationship remains valid\r\nover at least 4 orders of magnitude of the number of cycles, with very little experimental scatter. Then possible models of wear are discussed. It is assumed that the dominant mechanism of steel wear is its mechanical abrasion by nano-scale asperities on the coating that have relatively large attack angles, i.e. by the so-called sharp asperities.\r\nWear of coating is assumed to be mainly due to physical/chemical processes. Finally, models of the abrasion process for two basic cases are presented, namely a coated ball on a flat steel disk and a steel ball on a coated flat disk. The nominal contact region can be\r\nconsidered as constant in the former case, while in the latter case, the size of the region may be enlarged due to wear of the steel. These models of the abrasion process are based on the assumption of self-similar changes of the distribution function characterizing the statistical properties of patterns of scattered surface sharp asperities. It is shown that the power-law relationship for abrasion rate follows from the models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Borodich, Feodor M.","Keer, Leon M.","Harris, Stephen J."],"dc:date":"2003-01","doi":"10.1115/1.1509773","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27122,"sim:weight":0.348296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26522,"sim:weight":0.330678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28352,"sim:weight":0.323239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631779,"sim:weight":0.280586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27099,"sim:weight":0.273945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109115,"sim:weight":0.261453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77335,"sim:weight":0.252115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5842905,"sim:weight":0.250072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.209391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77159,"sim:weight":0.196605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780054,"sim:weight":0.193998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76778,"sim:weight":0.187174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56580,"sim:weight":0.185756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76244,"sim:weight":0.17377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567785,"sim:weight":0.164933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26482,"sim:weight":0.161362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821123,"sim:weight":0.158625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108116,"sim:weight":0.158624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27931,"sim:weight":0.156666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27120,"sim:weight":0.155047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The loadâ€“displacement and loadâ€“area curves are the basis for nanoindentation tests, and their interpretation is usually based on the main assumptions of the Hertz contact theory and formulae obtained for ideally shaped indenters. However, real indenters have some deviation from their nominal shapes leading researchers to develop empirical \u0027area functions\u0027 to relate the apparent contact area to depth. We argue that for both axisymmetric and three-dimensional cases, the indenter shape near the tip can be well approximated by monomial functions of radius. In this case problems obey the self-similar laws. Using Borodich\u0027s similarity considerations of three-dimensional contact problems and the corresponding formulae, fundamental relations are derived for depth of indentation, size of the contact region, load, hardness, and contact area, which are valid for both elastic and non-elastic, isotropic and anisotropic materials. For loading the formulae depend on the material hardening exponent and the degree of the monomial function of the shape. These formulae are especially important for shallow indentation (usually less than 100 nm) where the tip bluntness is of the same order as the indentation depth. Uncertainties in nanoindentation measurements that arise from geometric deviation of the indenter tip from its nominal geometry are explained and quantitatively described.","bibo:AuthorList":["Borodich, Feodor M.","Keer, Leon M.","Korach, Chad S."],"dc:date":"2003","doi":"10.1088/0957-4484","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5849099,"sim:weight":0.41102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31415,"sim:weight":0.36587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30831,"sim:weight":0.350806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.281817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11432,"sim:weight":0.281498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.268455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108116,"sim:weight":0.206158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76807,"sim:weight":0.189029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654018,"sim:weight":0.179738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108134,"sim:weight":0.173938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27098,"sim:weight":0.161841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26015,"sim:weight":0.15637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25850,"sim:weight":0.155923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316488,"sim:weight":0.140637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27821,"sim:weight":0.13888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.13761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27120,"sim:weight":0.134693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.128708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26027,"sim:weight":0.121046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76748,"sim:weight":0.108707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Clear evidence for a\r\nchange in shape of the insect flight muscle myosin motor between the resting (probably like the prepowerstroke)\r\nstate and the rigor state (considered to mimic the end-of-powerstroke conformation)\r\nhas been obtained. This illustrates the power of the low-angle X-ray diffraction method. The\r\nimplications of these new results about myosin motor action during muscle contraction are\r\ndiscussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Squire, John M.","AL-Khayat, Hind A.","Harford, Jeffrey J.","Hudson, Liam","Irving, Thomas C.","Knupp, Carlo","Reedy, Michael K."],"dc:date":"2003-12-01","doi":"10.1049/ip-nbt","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23279,"sim:weight":0.282603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780044,"sim:weight":0.216971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23286,"sim:weight":0.209749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32547,"sim:weight":0.192961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84771,"sim:weight":0.192462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85471,"sim:weight":0.177585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.175347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26920,"sim:weight":0.166007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76641,"sim:weight":0.164063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.15992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77295,"sim:weight":0.157128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77034,"sim:weight":0.155486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.14486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10924,"sim:weight":0.136042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23622,"sim:weight":0.129755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631987,"sim:weight":0.128081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24487,"sim:weight":0.118775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61295,"sim:weight":0.102097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26718,"sim:weight":0.0723626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2815074,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"A trouble shared: legal problems clusters in solicitors\u0027 and advice agencies","bibo:abstract":"The study examines whether and how clients of 12 solicitor firms and advice agencies present with multiple problems (clusters) and how these problems are dealt with. A mixture of solicitors, Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx), law centres/specialist advice agencies and local authority providers were considered. We decided to focus on three main areas of social welfare law where clusters were particularly likely to occur: housing, benefits and debt. The organisations were located in London and a range of locations across South Wales and South West England.\r\nThe research utilised a multi-method approach including: structured observation of 178 interviews between advisers and clients; structured interviews with advisers on 487 additional cases; and 35 semi-structured interviews with advisers about clients with multiple problems and surrounding service-delivery issues. We interviewed 58 clients about their experiences shortly after the interview, a further 36 of these clients were re-interviewed about their cases three or four months after the interview to get a stronger sense of how their cases had developed. Two workshops were held with advisers and stakeholders to discuss interim research findings.\r\n\r\nThe main findings of the research are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Within the agencies we observed and in casework carried out by those agencies, clusters of problems crossing specialist boundaries presented for about 40-50% of clients.\r\n- The most common clusters we saw were around housing, benefits and debt and relationship breakdown. As important as the clusters themselves, however, was the tendency for a broad range of different problems to occur for clients in unpredictable ways. Problems that involved relationship breakdown/children, home ownership, mental health, domestic violence, employment and homelessness problems gave rise to the most complex, and arguably the most serious, problems.\r\n\r\n- Analysis of the observation and client interview data suggests that most problems within clusters interrelate and would benefit from a degree of coordinated\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nCertain clients suffer from more problems because their problems are linked but also because these clients are amongst the most vulnerable in society. These clients\u0027 legal and social needs are complex and intersectional: their social and legal problems interrelate and amplify. Here the need for co-ordinated management of solutions to justiciable, and other, problems is strong.\r\n\r\n- There is evidence that justiciable problems cause, or are accompanied by, considerable stress, anxiety, and physical and mental health problems leaving clients with little energy for solving their problems.\r\n\r\n- As well as any outcome benefits from the specific problem being solved, advice, help and representation typically leave the client feeling more informed and calmer with reported reductions in stress levels and associated health problems.\r\n\r\n- The report identified a number of triggers for legal need, with the most common cause of advice seeking being the action or inaction of the local authority. Of the clients we observed, 37% had problems with local authorities.\r\n\r\n- Clusters usually presented explicitly, as part of the main issue the client raised initially with their adviser. However, about 12% of problems were raised implicitly, either through pro-active questioning by the adviser or being picked up through general dialogue with the client about the \u0027main\u0027 problem. Adviser interviewing skills played a part in this: those assessed as better interviewers on certain criteria exposed more complex problems.\r\n\r\n- A particularly important area is the extent to which advisers failed to expose the true extent of clients\u0027 problems during interview. Of the clients we followed up in interview, 29 out of 58 had some additional problems that had not been dealt with in the interviews. These were generally significant problems and about half were linked to their presenting problem(s) in some way (and so might more obviously give rise to a criticism of the adviser for failing to identify them).\r\n\r\nAnalysis of our data suggests the structure and organisation of advisers may make a difference to whether and how a client presents multiple problems.\r\n\r\n- Advisers, when faced with problems outside their expertise, were often not dealing with them \u0027seamlessly\u0027, particularly when a specialist\u0027s own organisation lacked specialist skills in the problem presented by the client.\r\n- Practitioners\u0027 understandings of holistic provision appeared to be confined to notions such as putting the client\u0027s problems in context and trying, with mixed success, to ensure that clients can be signposted to appropriate providers when the initial adviser cannot deal with a particular problem. Broader notions of holistic practice, such as tackling social as well as legal problems, were not accorded much attention by the practitioners to whom we spoke.\r\n\r\n- Barriers to holistic provision include funding arrangements, organisational capacities and skills, information deficits and other barriers to joint working.\r\n\r\n- Several advisers articulated that they felt that empowering clients was an important element of effective advice giving. The research highlights that whilst sometimes this worked well, and gave clients the confidence and information necessary to take more control of their own lives, often it did not. Clients were confused by the instructions they were given and left problems to fester or escalate as a result. Clients coping with years of social exclusion or dramatic worsening in their health or lifestyle and poor levels of educational attainment and self-esteem are often ill-equipped to deal with complex bureaucracies or hostile opponents.\r\n\r\nMeeting the multiple needs of vulnerable people is a challenging agenda for the public sector. Many public services are seeking to address service users\u0027 multiple needs, improve user experience, protect vulnerable people and provide service efficiency through the reconfiguration of services to make services seamless from the point of view of the user. Different models of seamless and holistic services are being developed within the public sector. Responses to the findings of this research may be able to draw on the emerging models and lessons available.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moorhead, Richard Lewis","Robinson, Margaret"],"dc:date":"2006-11-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":59486,"sim:weight":0.385886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.349684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.311046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.299393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76136,"sim:weight":0.293022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109026,"sim:weight":0.290534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":294473,"sim:weight":0.278574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.274393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.272517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76513,"sim:weight":0.266159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.240606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate that these criteria are indeed more effective.","bibo:AuthorList":["Liu, Xin-Ge","Wu, Min","Martin, Ralph Robert","Tang, Mei-Lan"],"dc:date":"2007-05-15","doi":"10.1016/j.cam.2006.03.003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222912,"sim:weight":0.363623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53204,"sim:weight":0.175921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23725,"sim:weight":0.164002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.146596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108624,"sim:weight":0.145431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.128079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932249,"sim:weight":0.125056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using a Lyapunov functional, and linear matrix inequality techniques (LMI), we derive a new delay-dependent exponential stability criterion for BAM neural networks with variable delays. As this criterion has no extra constraints on the variable delay functions, it can be applied to quite general BAM neural networks with a broad range of time delay functions. It is also easy to use in practice.

Such concepts privilege an understanding of human beings that is primarily relational rather than individualistic, and show that responsibility is, in the first place, about connection rather than respecting separation.

Although, there are various types of assets available, each with different capabilities, only a subset of these assets is useful for a specific task. This is due to the varying information needs of tasks. This gives rise to assigning useful assets to tasks such that the assets fully cover the information requirements of the individual tasks. The importance of this is amplified in the intelligence,surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) domain, especially in a coalition\r\ncontext. This is due to a variety of reasons such as the dynamic nature of the environment, scarcity of assets, high demand placed on available assets, sharing of assets among coalition parties, and so on. A significant amount of research been done by different communities to effciently assign assets to tasks and deliver information to the end user. However, there is little work done to infer sound alternative means to satisfy the information requirements of tasks so that the satisfiable tasks are increased. In this paper, we propose a hybrid reasoning approach (viz., a\r\ncombination of rule-based and ontology-based reasoning) based on current Semantic Web technologies to infer assets types that are necessary and sufficient to satisfy the requirements of tasks in a flexible manner.","bibo:AuthorList":["de Mel, Geeth","Sensoy, Murat","Vasconcelos, Wamberto","Preece, Alun David"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1512195,"sim:weight":0.365364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.220401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.192851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.190045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.189087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.187154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108018,"sim:weight":0.143631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.122519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In our previous work, we showed how assets can be matched to mission tasks by formalising the military missions and means framework in terms of an ontology, and using this ontology to drive a matchmaking process derived from the area of semantic Web services. The work reported here extends the earlier approach in two important ways: (1) by providing a richer and more realistic way for a user to specify their information requirements, and (2) by using the results of the semantic matchmaking process to define the search space for efficient asset allocation algorithms. We accomplish (1) by means of a rule-based representation of the NIIRS approach to relating sensed data to the tasks that data may support. We illustrate (2)by showing how the output of our matching process can drive a well-known efficient combinatorial auction algorithm (CASS).

But to achieve a high level of performance, occupants will need to operate buildings in very specific ways. Future homes may be less like machines for living in, and more like complex systems of interconnected equipment that place significant cognitive, physical and psychological demands on those who inhabit them. Adapting to low carbon technologies will require changes to existing practices, new skills, and will offer new experiences - both good and bad - that will influence or even determine their adoption by users. This paper considers how designers of low carbon buildings can increase their understanding of how occupants might interact with these buildings. The paper draws parallels with the co-evolution of technology and users in the computing industry during the 1980s and examine the changing attitudes to \u0027the user\u0027 and the methods developed through usability studies to offer a better interactive experience. Such methods suggest ways of studying occupant interactions with buildings and their systems, but need to be adapted to be relevant to enclosures rather than devices.The paper highlights the relevance of Gibson\u0027s concept of affordance as a tool with which to explore the terrain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tweed, Aidan Christopher"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.279916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643243,"sim:weight":0.264558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11127,"sim:weight":0.247996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59326,"sim:weight":0.246893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.237618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.226965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.226789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.2211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim was to extract the following information for each medication: name, dosage, mode/route, frequency, duration and reason.Design The system implements a rule-based methodology, which exploits typical morphological, lexical, syntactic and semantic features of the targeted information. These features were acquired from the training dataset and public resources such as the UMLS and relevant web pages. Information extracted by pattern matching was combined together using context-sensitive heuristic rules.Measurements The system was applied to a set of 547 previously unseen discharge summaries, and the extracted information was evaluated against a manually prepared gold standard consisting of 251 documents. The overall ranking of the participating teams was obtained using the micro-averaged F-measure as the primary evaluation metric.Results The implemented method achieved the micro-averaged F-measure of 81% (with 86% precision and 77% recall), which ranked this system third in the challenge. The significance tests revealed the system\u0027s performance to be not significantly different from that of the second ranked system. Relative to other systems, this system achieved the best F-measure for the extraction of duration (53%) and reason (46%).Conclusion Based on the F-measure, the performance achieved (81%) was in line with the initial agreement between human annotators (82%), indicating that such a system may greatly facilitate the process of extracting relevant information from medical records by providing a solid basis for a manual review process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spasic, Irena","Sarafraz, Farzaneh","Keane, John A.","Nenadic, Goran"],"dc:date":"2010-09","doi":"10.1136/jamia.2010.003657","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Experimental data sets from metabolomics studies need to be integrated with one another, but also with data produced by other types of omics studies in the spirit of systems biology, hence the pressing need for vocabularies and ontologies in metabolomics. However, it is time-consuming and non trivial to construct these resources manually. RESULTS: We describe a methodology for rapid development of controlled vocabularies, a study originally motivated by the needs for vocabularies describing metabolomics technologies. We present case studies involving two controlled vocabularies (for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography) whose development is currently underway as part of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative. The initial vocabularies were compiled manually, providing a total of 243 and 152 terms. A total of 5,699 and 2,612 new terms were acquired automatically from the literature. The analysis of the results showed that full-text articles (especially the Materials and Methods sections) are the major source of technology-specific terms as opposed to paper abstracts. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest a text mining method for efficient corpus-based term acquisition as a way of rapidly expanding a set of controlled vocabularies with the terms used in the scientific literature. We adopted an integrative approach, combining relatively generic software and data resources for time- and cost-effective development of a text mining tool for expansion of controlled vocabularies across various domains, as a practical alternative to both manual term collection and tailor-made named entity recognition methods.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spasic, Irena","Schober, Daniel","Sansone, Susanna-Assunta","Rebholz-Schuhmann, Dietrich","Kell, Douglas B.","Paton, Norman W."],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-9-S5-S5","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.182447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77182,"sim:weight":0.181021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.1788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.165302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.155775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16075,"sim:weight":0.144628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.127457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Their gross influence on the behaviour of the cell can be observed using large-scale metabolomic studies. The metabolomic data produced need to be structured and annotated in a machine-usable form to facilitate the exploration of the hidden links between the genes and their functions. Description: MeMo is a formal model for representing metabolomic data and the associated metadata. Two predominant platforms (SQL and XML) are used to encode the model. MeMo has been implemented as a relational database using a hybrid approach combining the advantages of the two technologies. It represents a practical solution for handling the sheer volume and complexity of the metabolomic data effectively and efficiently. The MeMo model and the associated software are available at http://dbkgroup.org/memo/. Conclusions: The maturity of relational database technology is used to support efficient data processing. The scalability and self-descriptiveness of XML are used to simplify the relational schema and facilitate the extensibility of the model necessitated by the creation of new experimental techniques. Special consideration is given to data integration issues as part of the systems biology agenda. MeMo has been physically integrated and cross-linked to related metabolomic and genomic databases. Semantic integration with other relevant databases has been supported through ontological annotation. Compatibility with other data formats is supported by automatic conversion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spasic, Irena","Dunn, Warwick B.","Velarde, Giles","Tseng, Andy","Jenkins, Helen","Hardy, Nigel","Oliver, Stephen G.","Kell, Douglas B."],"dc:date":"2006","doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-7-281","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19628,"sim:weight":0.320651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19527,"sim:weight":0.308515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.228157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930966,"sim:weight":0.226153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106936,"sim:weight":0.201359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57140,"sim:weight":0.190067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931322,"sim:weight":0.180999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.175743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26701,"sim:weight":0.160786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.122508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The efficacy of anti-EGFR therapies can be influenced by the presence of heregulins (HRGs), which can bind erbB3/4 receptors and can activate alternative signalling pathways. In the present study we have examined whether HRG signalling can circumvent EGFR blockade in an EGFR-positive tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 (Tam-R) breast cancer cell line. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nTam-R cells, incubated with the selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (\u0027Iressa\u0027, ZD1839), were exposed to HRGβ1 and the effects on erbB receptor dimerization profiles and on activation of associated downstream signalling components were assessed by immunoprecipitation, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The effects of HRGβ1 on gefitinib-treated Tam-R cell growth and invasion were also examined, and HRGβ1 expression levels were assessed in breast cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry to address the potential clinical relevance of such a resistance mechanism. \r\n\r\nResults\r\nIn Tam-R cells, HRGβ1 promoted erbB3/erbB2 and erbB3/EGFR heterodimerization, promoted ERK1/2 and AKT pathway activation and increased cell proliferation and invasion. Gefitinib prevented HRGβ1-driven erbB3/EGFR heterodimerization, ERK1/2 activation and Tam-R cell proliferation, but HRGβ1-driven erbB3/erbB2 heterodimerization, AKT activation and Tam-R cell invasion were maintained. A combination of gefitinib and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 effectively blocked HRGβ1-mediated intracellular signalling activity, growth and invasion in Tam-R cells. Similarly, targeting erbB2 with trastuzumab in combination with gefitinib in Tam-R cells reduced HRGβ1-induced erbB2 and ERK1/2 activity; however, HRGβ1-driven AKT activity and cell growth were maintained while cell invasion was significantly enhanced with this combination. In clinical tissue all samples demonstrated cytoplasmic tumour epithelial HRGβ1 protein staining, with expression correlating with EGFR positivity and activation of both AKT and ERK1/2. \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nHRGβ1 can overcome the inhibitory effects of gefitinib on cell growth and invasion in Tam-R cells through promotion of erbB3/erbB2 heterodimerization and activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signalling pathway. This may have implications for the effectiveness of anti-EGFR therapies in breast cancer as HRGβ1 is enriched in many EGFR-positive breast tumours.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hutcheson, Iain Robert","Knowlden, Janice Mary","Hiscox, Stephen Edward","Barrow, Denise","Gee, Julia Margaret Wendy","Robertson, J.

Conventional drug design has mainly focused on the inhibition of a single protein, usually an enzyme or receptor, since these proteins often contain a clearly defined ligand-binding site with which a small-molecule drug can be designed to interact. Designing a small molecule to bind to a protein–protein interface and subsequently inhibit the interaction poses several challenges, including the initial identification of suitable protein–protein interactions, the surface area of the interface (it is often large), and the location of ‘hot spots’ (small regions suitable for drug binding). This article reviews the general approach to designing inhibitors of protein–protein interactions, and then focuses on recent advances in the use of small molecules targeted against a variety of protein–protein interactions that have therapeutic potential for cancer.","bibo:AuthorList":["White, Alex William","Westwell, Andrew","Brahemi, Ghali"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1017/S1462399408000641","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24079,"sim:weight":0.272297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.228401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":135088,"sim:weight":0.217745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222812,"sim:weight":0.214842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.209315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393909,"sim:weight":0.205883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929888,"sim:weight":0.188781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222852,"sim:weight":0.152895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.149724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76961,"sim:weight":0.115237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The supercritically synthesized ceria support was used to prepare Au–Pd based catalysts for the selective oxidation of alcohols in solvent-free conditions using molecular oxygen as oxidant. The supercritically precipitated catalyst demonstrated high activity for alcohol oxidation, and it was much more active than catalysts prepared using a CeO2 support derived from the acetate through a non-supercritical synthesis route. The bimetallic Au–Pd supported catalyst was considerably more active than monometallic catalysts containing Au and Pd only. HAADF imaging and STEM–XEDS mapping showed that both Au and Pd metallic components were intimately mixed and uniformly highly dispersed over the supercritical nanocrystalline CeO2 support spheres. In contrast, the Au–Pd catalyst on the non-supercritical CeO2 support showed discrete uniform Au–Pd alloy particles with a size range of 50 to 150 nm. The homogeneous alloy particles were Au-rich and Pd-deficient as compared with the preparation ratio and a low number of highly dispersed Pd was also associated with the support. XPS data for the ceria supported catalysts confirmed the differences of metal dispersion and identified that in both cases the surface species present were Au0 and Pd2+. On extended re-use the non-supercritical Au–Pd/CeO2 catalyst showed sequential deactivation. On the contrary, the supercritical Au–Pd/CeO2 catalyst showed a significant increase of activity, and it was only during the third re-use that the activity was marginally lower than the fresh catalyst. After use the spherical morphology of nanocrystalline supercritical CeO2 started to increasingly break down, until the morphology started to resemble the CeO2 prepared by the non-supercritical route. Simultaneously there was an increase of the metal particle size on the supercritically prepared CeO2 support, as discrete Au-rich and Pd-rich bimetallic particles were formed, and there was a decrease of the metal content. XPS confirmed the loss of metal on use and showed that there was reduction of the ceria surface during use. The increase of activity with a corresponding loss of metal components indicates that the fresh catalyst contains Au and Pd in inactive forms, whilst the active sites have extremely high turnover frequencies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miedziak, Peter John","Tang, Zhongliang","Davies, Thomas E.","Enache, Dan I.","Bartley, Jonathan Keith","Carley, Albert Frederick","Herzing, Andrew A.","Taylor, Stuart Hamilton","Hutchings, Graham John"],"dc:date":"2009-08-03","doi":"10.1039/b911102f","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8769344,"sim:weight":0.504892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11483,"sim:weight":0.322109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75562,"sim:weight":0.30118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75445,"sim:weight":0.29544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76890,"sim:weight":0.291756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631992,"sim:weight":0.291672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1563937,"sim:weight":0.256167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76938,"sim:weight":0.239835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631695,"sim:weight":0.239189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24646,"sim:weight":0.23814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10924,"sim:weight":0.237192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512452,"sim:weight":0.220593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222860,"sim:weight":0.214082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932014,"sim:weight":0.208932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1566204,"sim:weight":0.201865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821065,"sim:weight":0.197273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10937,"sim:weight":0.186035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222866,"sim:weight":0.184983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75490,"sim:weight":0.184814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631961,"sim:weight":0.171378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Au−Pd nanoparticles are found in the majority of cases to be homogeneous alloys, although some variation is observed in the AuPd composition at high Pd/Au ratios. The optimum performance for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide is observed for a catalyst having a Au/Pd 1:2 molar ratio. However, the competing hydrogenation reaction of hydrogen peroxide increases with increasing Pd content, although Pd alone is less effective than when Au is also present. Investigation of the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using these materials also shows that the optimum selective oxidation to the aldehyde occurs for the Au/Pd 1:2 molar ratio catalyst. These measured activity trends are discussed in terms of the structure and composition of the supported Au−Pd nanoparticles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pritchard, James Charles","Kesavan, Lokesh","Piccinini, Marco","He, Qian","Tiruvalam, Ramchandra","Dimitratos, Nikolaos","Lopez-Sanchez, Jose Antonio","Carley, Albert Frederick","Edwards, Jennifer Kelly","Kiely, Christopher John","Hutchings, Graham John"],"dc:date":"2010-05-12","doi":"10.1021/la101597q","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8769344,"sim:weight":0.69244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75562,"sim:weight":0.397728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826627,"sim:weight":0.355557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11483,"sim:weight":0.345928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1563937,"sim:weight":0.321349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75445,"sim:weight":0.306805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567209,"sim:weight":0.297863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76938,"sim:weight":0.294595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10924,"sim:weight":0.271578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222860,"sim:weight":0.251706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1566204,"sim:weight":0.244217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24646,"sim:weight":0.212998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631958,"sim:weight":0.202403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.192352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75490,"sim:weight":0.183378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75935,"sim:weight":0.158133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931920,"sim:weight":0.150787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10937,"sim:weight":0.149032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631992,"sim:weight":0.145852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105106,"sim:weight":0.139577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The effect of the addition of an alkane co-solvent during the reflux stage of the preparation was investigated. The addition of C4–C16n-alkanes was observed to affect the structure of the vanadium phosphate products significantly. Without the alkane the product is VOHPO4·0.5H2O which is the precursor to the industrial catalyst. Addition of the alkane leads to the formation of VO(H2PO4)2, with its characteristic block-shaped crystallites, and the alkane/alcohol liquid phase solubilises the excess vanadium. The amount of alkane required to induce these changes decreased with increasing carbon number of the n-alkane. The effect of the addition of the alkane co-solvent is thought to effect the rate of reduction of V5+ to V4+ which then reacts with phosphoric acid to give either VOHPO4·0.5H2O or VO(H2PO4)2. If the reduction step is fast then the local P : V4+ ratio is approximately 1 and VOHPO4·0.5H2O is the major product. However, if the reduction step is slow then the local P : V4+ ratio is much higher and VO(H2PO4)2 is preferentially formed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sithamparappillai, Umacaran","Nuno, Jesus Luque","Dummer, Nicholas","Weng, Weihao","Kiely, Christopher John","Bartley, Jonathan Keith","Hutchings, Graham John"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1039/c0jm00403k","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108054,"sim:weight":0.326296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75490,"sim:weight":0.157119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.156371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76604,"sim:weight":0.155955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821065,"sim:weight":0.144892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10943,"sim:weight":0.139977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75325,"sim:weight":0.138598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631076,"sim:weight":0.133305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222866,"sim:weight":0.132529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631987,"sim:weight":0.131163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631546,"sim:weight":0.128505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85378,"sim:weight":0.127459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631992,"sim:weight":0.123051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631819,"sim:weight":0.122398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76038,"sim:weight":0.121203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780054,"sim:weight":0.112995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930758,"sim:weight":0.111021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10937,"sim:weight":0.0984057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631932,"sim:weight":0.0902913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To mask the hardware and software complexities from the scientific end user, it would be advantageous to access and use a petascale computer through an advanced problem-solving environment.

However, the ion transport pathways that operate to maintain stromal hydration have yet to be fully elucidated. Methods: We used RT-PCR to identify the gene expression profile of members of the ClC family of chloride channels in freshly isolated samples of rabbit corneal endothelium, stroma, and epithelium. The expression of a separate group of genes was also examined to confirm the purity of the sample collection protocol. The expression of the ClC-2 and ClC-3 channel protein in the cornea was also evaluated by light and electron microscopic immunolabelling. Results: The mRNA for ClC-2, ClC-3, ClC-5, ClC-6, and ClC-7 were expressed in both the corneal epithelium and endothelium, and in the stroma. The mRNA for the skeletal muscle specific channel ClC-1 and the kidney specific chloride channel ClC-Ka were not detectable. ClC-4 mRNA was not detected in any rabbit tissue examined. The expression pattern of the mRNAs for collagens V, VI, VII, and VIII demonstrated the absence of contamination in epithelial and endothelial samples. ClC-2 and ClC-3 immunolabelling confirmed the presence of these proteins in corneal endothelium, stroma, and epithelium. Conclusions: Together with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and calcium activated chloride channel-1 (CLCA1), these results bring the number of chloride channel genes known to be expressed in the corneal endothelium and epithelium to seven.

Collagen involvement in myopia development via scleral remodeling is well-known. Recently, COL1A1 and COL2A1 gene polymorphisms were reported to be associated with high-grade and common myopia, respectively. This study was conducted to investigate whether these collagen genes are associated and/or genetically linked with myopia in large Caucasian family datasets. METHODS. High-grade myopia was defined as ??5.00 D. Two independent datasets comprising 146 (Duke) and 130 (Cardiff) families with high-grade myopia participated in the association study. Allelic discrimination assays were performed on tagging SNPs for COL1A1 and COL2A1. The pedigree disequilibrium test (PDT) and the association test in the presence of linkage (APL) were used for association analyses. Linkage analyses for COL2A1 locus markers were performed with the Fastlink and Merlin programs in conjunction with data obtained from our collaborative whole-genome linkage study (254 families). RESULTS. Significant association was identified between five SNPs (rs1034762, rs1635529, rs1793933, rs3803183, and rs17122571) of the COL2A1 locus and high-grade myopia (P ? 0.045, minimum (min) P ? 0.008) and with myopia status set at ??0.50 or ?0.75 D (min P ? 0.004) in the Duke dataset. The SNP rs1635529 also showed significant association in the Cardiff dataset (??5.00 D, min P ? 0.004; ??0.50 D, min P ? 0.007). Linkage analyses showed suggestive linkage to the COL2A1 locus on 12q. No association was found between COL1A1 SNPs and any degree of myopia. CONCLUSIONS. The COL2A1 gene was associated with highgrade myopia in two independent Caucasian family datasets. COL1A1 gene polymorphisms were not associated with myopia in our dataset, indicating possible heterogeneity across different ethnicities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Metlapally, Ravikanth","Li, Yi-Ju","Tran-Viet, Khanh-Nhat","Abbott, Diana","Czaja, Gregory R.","Malecaze, Francois","Calvas, Patrick","Mackey, David","Rosenberg, Thomas","Paget, Sandrine","Zayats, Tetyana","Owen, Michael","Guggenheim, Jeremy Andrew","Young, Terri L."],"dc:date":"2009-09","doi":"10.1167/iovs.08-3346","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":117135,"sim:weight":0.215131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5532,"sim:weight":0.16081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26254,"sim:weight":0.145984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86071,"sim:weight":0.136056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25068,"sim:weight":0.133011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1434504,"sim:weight":0.131915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76613,"sim:weight":0.130489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76597,"sim:weight":0.125697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222833,"sim:weight":0.117896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75994,"sim:weight":0.114482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643971,"sim:weight":0.107668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643983,"sim:weight":0.09753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631478,"sim:weight":0.0974134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26783,"sim:weight":0.0938566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77984,"sim:weight":0.0890789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.0814986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631997,"sim:weight":0.0744969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23818,"sim:weight":0.056025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In two of the studies, a significant association was found while in the third, there was no association. We sought to investigate the association between high myopia and polymorphisms in MYOC in subjects of European ethnicity. Methods: Subjects were recruited from two sites, Cardiff University in the UK and Duke University in the United States. The Cardiff University cohort was comprised of 164 families with high myopia (604 subjects) plus 112 unrelated, highly myopic cases and 114 emmetropic controls. The Duke University cohort was comprised of 87 families with high myopia (362 subjects) plus 59 unrelated, highly myopic cases. Subject DNA was genotyped with a panel of MYOC single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including those found previously associated with high myopia. The Cardiff cohort was also genotyped for two flanking microsatellite markers analyzed in prior studies. Association between high myopia and MYOC polymorphisms was assessed using the Unphased program. Results: Since there was no evidence of heterogeneity in genotype frequencies between families and singleton samples or between cohorts, both subject groups (families and unrelated subjects) from both recruitment sites were analyzed jointly for those SNPs genotyped in common. Two variants showed significant association before correction for multiple testing. These two variants were rs16864720 (p\u003d0.043) and NGA17 (p\u003d0.026). However, there was no significant association after Bonferroni correction. The estimated relative risk (RR) conferred by each of the MYOC variants was low (RR\u003c1.5).

We sought to investigate whether these associations were evident in subjects from the United Kingdom (UK). Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Participants: The study population comprised 74,459 subjects aged 18 to 100 years attending UK optometry practices for an eye examination. Methods: Data comprising non-cycloplegic spectacle prescription, sex, date of birth, and date of eye examination were collected from UK optometry practices. The average refractive error in fellow eyes was used to classify the degree of myopia in diopters (D) for each subject as follows: absent (??0.75 D), low (?0.75 to ?2.99 D), moderate (?3.00 to ?5.99 D), or high (??6.00 D). The average monthly hours of daylight for London, UK, were classified into 1 of 4 “photoperiod categories,” following Mandel et al. The odds ratio (OR) for each level of severity of myopia was calculated using multivariate logistic regression with age, sex, and either season of birth or photoperiod category as risk factors. Main Outcome Measures: The OR for season of birth and photoperiod category as potential risk factors for myopia. Results: Season of birth was significantly associated with the presence of high myopia: Subjects born in summer or autumn were more likely to be highly myopic compared with those born in winter (summer OR ? 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05–1.30; P ? 0.006; autumn OR ? 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04–1.30; P ? 0.007). However, season of birth was not a significant risk factor for low or moderate myopia. Photoperiod category was weakly associated with low myopia (OR ? 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–0.99; P ? 0.019), but with a direction of effect opposite to that observed by Mandel et al. Conclusions: As in Israel, a disproportionate number of UK high myopes were born in summer or autumn rather than in winter. However, unlike the situation in Israel, this association does not seem to be related to daylight hours during the postnatal period, implicating alternative physiologic influences that vary with season, such as birth weight.","bibo:AuthorList":["McMahon, George","Zayats, Tetyana","Chen, Yen-Po","Prashar, Ankush","Williams, Cathy","Guggenheim, Jeremy Andrew"],"dc:date":"2009-03","doi":"10.1016/j.ophtha.2008.10.004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5532,"sim:weight":0.193693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222627,"sim:weight":0.163092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.155365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.151124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77003,"sim:weight":0.146198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85277,"sim:weight":0.146194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22742,"sim:weight":0.146066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631997,"sim:weight":0.142869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77264,"sim:weight":0.131209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.129208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.125834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.125313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27139,"sim:weight":0.122923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222629,"sim:weight":0.122395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76340,"sim:weight":0.119822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.117405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56591,"sim:weight":0.116389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222998,"sim:weight":0.0858575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108088,"sim:weight":0.0835248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222882,"sim:weight":0.0804142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The results suggest a rational method for arresting or reversing the development of myopia, which may be useful in the treatment of human myopia if the primate retina is also capable of responding to simultaneously presented opposing defocus cues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tse, Dennis Y.","Lam, Carly S.","Guggenheim, Jeremy Andrew","Lam, Chuen","Li, King-kit","Liu, Quan","To, Chi-ho"],"dc:date":"2007-12","doi":"10.1167/iovs.07-0383","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15010,"sim:weight":0.343837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176871,"sim:weight":0.248619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176835,"sim:weight":0.233806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5532,"sim:weight":0.198521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.164237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.163597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.160041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.157403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.157403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.156105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.156105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.155596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.155596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54114,"sim:weight":0.14026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85172,"sim:weight":0.11524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176864,"sim:weight":0.113024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.112784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.112551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.109174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69994,"sim:weight":0.106058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the exact visual and neurochemical signaling mechanisms involving myopic eye growth are yet to be elucidated. The feasibility of applying a novel two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis technique for global protein profilings and a search for differential protein expressions in LIM were explored in the present study. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed employing a “minimal Lysine labeling” approach and a reverse CyeDye experimental protocol using retinal tissue from chicks. The retinal protein profiles between myopic and control eyes were found to be very similar. More than a thousand protein spots could be detected on a 2D gel. Sixteen and ten protein spots were found to be up-regulated and downregulated respectively in the myopic eyes according to our preset criteria with the inclusion of an internal pool standard. About 65% of those filtered spots could be successfully identified by peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry . Most of the differentially expressed proteins were found to be related to cytoskeletal or oxidative functions. According to the prediction of subcellular locations, most of them (about 84%) were classified as cytoplasmic proteins. The cellular functions for those differentially expressed proteins were reported and their possible involvements in the compensated eye growth were discussed. We have optimized a workable protocol for the study of the differential retinal protein expressions in the LIM using 2DDIGE approach which was shown to have a number of advantages over the traditional 2D electrophoresis technique.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lam, Thomas C.","Li, King-Kit","Lo, Samuel C.

Furthermore, critics have evaluated Fair Trade governance against the benchmark of perfect market organisation. However, given the realities of the developing world, dismantling Fair Trade abandons poor producers not to theoretical free markets and successful diversification, but to market failures, capability constraints, and risk management issues - all of which present serious obstacles to beneficial change.

Bibliographies of all studies and systematic reviews were searched by hand. \r\nStudy selection\r\nStudies were selected based on: self ventilating participants with neurodegenerative conditions; interventions aimed at improving respiratory function; outcomes were any valid and reliable measures of respiratory function. \r\nStudy appraisal\r\nStudies were appraised by one reviewer using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Data was synthesised using a narrative approach.\r\nResults\r\nThirty five studies were included in the review. The strongest evidence was for the use of non-invasive ventilation for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although this was weak. The evidence for the use of respiratory muscle training and methods to increase peak cough flow shows a positive effect, but is also weak.\r\nConclusion\r\nThere is weak evidence for the positive effects of physiotherapy interventions for respiratory problems in people with neurodegenerative conditions. Further work is necessary in specific neurodegenerative conditions to identify why respiratory problems occur and larger scale studies to investigate management of these problems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Una Frances","Enright, Stephanie","Busse, Monica Erika"],"dc:date":"2012","doi":"10.1016/j.physio.2011.03.002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222799,"sim:weight":0.233185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.217117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.213389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76674,"sim:weight":0.20736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.206923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65494,"sim:weight":0.189161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100492,"sim:weight":0.189078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.187158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.185055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25874,"sim:weight":0.184089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10910,"sim:weight":0.182403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19193,"sim:weight":0.17921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.170672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25931,"sim:weight":0.166501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75310,"sim:weight":0.16411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76027,"sim:weight":0.163559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13965,"sim:weight":0.163315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.153447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.151826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632061,"sim:weight":0.125278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

INX-08189 was highly potent in replicon assays, with a 50% effective concentration of 10 ± 6 nM against hepatitis C genotype 1b at 72 h. The inhibitory effect on viral replication was rapid, with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 35 ± 8 nM at 24 h. An intracellular 2\u0027-C-methyl guanosine triphosphate (2\u0027-C-MeGTP) concentration of 2.43 ± 0.42 pmol/106 cells was sufficient to achieve 90% inhibition of viral replication. In vitro resistance studies confirmed that the S282T mutation in the NS5b gene conferred an approximately 10-fold reduction in sensitivity to INX-08189. However, the complete inhibition of S282T mutant replicons still could be achieved with an EC90 of 344 ± 170 nM. Drug combination studies of INX-08189 and ribavirin indicated significant synergy in antiviral potency both in wild-type and S282T-expressing replicons. Genotype 1b replicons could be cleared after 14 days of culture when exposed to as little as 20 nM INX-08189. No evidence of mitochondrial toxicity was observed after 14 days of INX-08189 exposure in both HepG2 and CEM human cell lines. In vivo studies of rats and cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that 2\u0027-C-MeGTP concentrations in liver equivalent to the EC90 could be attained after a single oral dose of INX-08189. Rat liver 2\u0027-C-MeGTP concentrations were proportional to dose, sustained for greater than 24 h, and correlated with plasma concentrations of the nucleoside metabolite 2\u0027-C-methyl guanosine. The characteristics displayed by INX-08189 support its continued development as a clinical candidate for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vernachio, John H.","Bleiman, Blair","Bryant, K.

Clinic based methods that simultaneously quantify different aspects of movement over a range of activities and model functional recovery will help guide rehabilitation. \r\n\r\nMethods: A longitudinal study was used to measure gait variables at initial physiotherapy attendance and then at monthly intervals using a digital camcorder and computer for quantitative analysis. Jogging and distance hopping were added during recovery. A sample of 63 ACL deficient subjects entered the study and 48 subjects were measured at least three times. To determine the pattern of recovery, repeated measurements were analysed using a least square fit of the data. \r\n\r\nResults: Gait variables took between 95 and 130 days post injury to reach the control mean and stabilise shortly after this. Hopping distance for the injured leg took 62 days to recover to within normal limits and 5 months post injury to reach the control mean. Jogging was already within the control limits at 30 days post injury and demonstrated little change with recovery. \r\n\r\nConclusions: Functional recovery of multiple variables has been modelled. In the early phase of post injury, gait velocity seems to be the most useful variable to measure improvement. Recovery of more challenging activities appears to take an average of 5 months. Therefore, patients may need to be monitored in physiotherapy until this time and advised not to return to sport until sufficient recovery is demonstrated on activities such as distance hopping.","bibo:AuthorList":["Button, Kate","Van Deursen, Robert William Martin","Price, Patricia Elaine"],"dc:date":"2005","doi":"10.1136/bjsm.2005.019984","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26758,"sim:weight":0.247223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77309,"sim:weight":0.230849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.224775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13965,"sim:weight":0.215102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.206288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75274,"sim:weight":0.204104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75630,"sim:weight":0.199283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.191208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10910,"sim:weight":0.184095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.176669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.168657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.162636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.161131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77770,"sim:weight":0.148846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26590,"sim:weight":0.148339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.143682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56591,"sim:weight":0.135824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A pure magnetic peak, at half the scattering vector of the structural Bragg peak from the multilayer, was observed from layers with and without deliberate oxygen contamination in the middle of the copper spacer layer. With increasing field in the sample plane, the magnetic peak intensity varied very differently for the two types of sample due to the high sensitivity of the magnetic scattering to changes in moment rotation in the sample plane. The data provide strong support for a model of biquadratic coupling in the contaminated samples and bilinear, antiferromagnetic coupling in the clean samples.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hase, T. P.

In these disordered self-doped materials we observe a large nonlinear component in the Hall effect at low temperatures. The close scaling between the Hall data and the magnetization implies that this effect is an anomalous Hall effect rather than a change of carrier concentration with magnetic field. The extracted anomalous Hall coefficient is found to scale linearly with the resistivity, indicating that it is due to skew scattering of the conduction electrons by the defects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guilaran, I.

Persistent photoconductivity (PPC) has been shown to exist only in the In-doped sample, the effect of PPC on the spin glass transition temperature using bulk magnetic susceptibility has also been studied, indicating the presence of bound magnetic polarons. μSR on the Al-doped sample clearly shows the spin glass transition, however, the presence of the DX center, which causes PPC when doping with In donors, perturbs the muon response. Particular attention is paid to the possibility of the DX center trapping muonium, preventing the detection of the spin glass transition. PPC does not induce a change in the muon response, however, we find continuous illumination of the sample allows the observation of the spin glass transition.

The fidelity of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of accretion disks depends on how artificial viscosity (AV) is formulated.\r\n\r\nAims. We investigate whether standard methodology is reliable in this regard.\r\n\r\nMethods. We test the operation of two methods for selective application of AV in SPH simulations of Keplerian accretion disks, using a ring spreading test to quantify effective viscosity, and a correlation coefficient technique to measure the formation of unwanted prograde alignments of particles.\r\n\r\nResults. Neither the Balsara switch (B) nor time dependent viscosity (TDV) work effectively, as they leave AV active in areas of smooth shearing flow, and do not eliminate the accumulation of alignments of particles in the prograde direction. The effect of both switches is periodic, the periodicity dependent on radius and unaffected by the density of particles. We demonstrate that a very simple algorithm activates AV only when truly convergent flow is detected and reduces the unwanted formation of prograde alignments. The new switch works by testing whether all the neighbours of a particle are in Keplerian orbit around the same point, rather than calculating the divergence of the velocity field, which is very strongly affected by Poisson noise in the positions of the SPH particles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cartwright, Annabel","Stamatelos, Dimitrios"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1051/0004-6361","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2300471,"sim:weight":0.306093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85558,"sim:weight":0.267729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.210151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2313076,"sim:weight":0.191585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75482,"sim:weight":0.18581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176870,"sim:weight":0.176904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176882,"sim:weight":0.167738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85400,"sim:weight":0.167718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.136286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2309348,"sim:weight":0.135057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.132277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53534,"sim:weight":0.128086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27227,"sim:weight":0.120849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86033,"sim:weight":0.120358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86037,"sim:weight":0.120017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85329,"sim:weight":0.117522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We describe the results of the first NINJA analysis which focused on gravitational waveforms from binary black hole coalescence. Ten numerical relativity groups contributed numerical data which were used to generate a set of gravitational-wave signals. These signals were injected into a simulated data set, designed to mimic the response of the initial LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. Nine groups analysed this data using search and parameter-estimation pipelines. Matched filter algorithms, un-modelled-burst searches and Bayesian parameter estimation and model-selection algorithms were applied to the data. We report the efficiency of these search methods in detecting the numerical waveforms and measuring their parameters.

In order to undertake electromagnetic follow-ups of gravitational wave signals, it will be necessary to accurately localize them in the sky. As gravitational wave detectors are not inherently pointing instruments, localization will occur primarily through triangulation with a network of detectors. The expected timing accuracy for observed signals and the consequences for localization are investigated. In addition, the effect of systematic uncertainties in the waveform and calibration of the instruments on the localization of sources is discussed. Illustrative results of timing and localization accuracy as well as systematic effects for coalescing binary waveforms are provided.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fairhurst, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2009-12","doi":"10.1088/1367-2630","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24225,"sim:weight":0.194266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631516,"sim:weight":0.188808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2311136,"sim:weight":0.186788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71065,"sim:weight":0.142019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It contains a three-band imaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 μm, and an imaging Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS) which covers simultaneously its whole operating range of 194–671 μm (447–1550 GHz). The SPIRE detectors are arrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 K. The photometer has a field of view of 4´× 8´, observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands. Its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scanned across the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas if desired. The spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with a diameter of 2.6´. The spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25 GHz by changing the stroke length of the FTS scan mirror. Its main operating mode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the FTS mirror to acquire spectral data. For extended source measurements, multiple position offsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achieve the desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to map areas larger than the field of view. The SPIRE instrument consists of a cold focal plane unit located inside the Herschel cryostat and warm electronics units, located on the spacecraft Service Module, for instrument control and data handling. Science data are transmitted to Earth with no on-board data compression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated science products. The in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceeds predictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometer sensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, and the spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5–2.","bibo:AuthorList":["Griffin, M.

We outline our data reduction strategy and present some science highlights on the two observed 2° × 2° tiles approximately centered at l \u003d 30° and l \u003d 59°. The two regions are extremely rich in intense and highly structured extended emission which shows a widespread organization in filaments. Source SEDs can be built for hundreds of objects in the two fields, and physical parameters can be extracted, for a good fraction of them where the distance could be estimated. The compact sources (which we will call cores\u0027 in the following) are found for the most part to be associated with the filaments, and the relationship to the local beam-averaged column density of the filament itself shows that a core seems to appear when a threshold around AV ~ 1 is exceeded for the regions in the l \u003d 59° field; a AV value between 5 and 10 is found for the l \u003d 30° field, likely due to the relatively higher distances of the sources. This outlines an exciting scenario where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments, which later fragment to cores where the column density has reached a critical level. In spite of core L/M ratios being well in excess of a few for many sources, we find core surface densities between 0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. Our results are in good agreement with recent MHD numerical simulations of filaments forming from large-scale converging flows.","bibo:AuthorList":["Molinari, S.","Swinyard, B.","Bally, J.","Barlow, M.","Bernard, J.-P.","Martin, P.","Moore, T.","Noriega-Crespo, A.","Plume, R.","Testi, L.","Zavagno, A.","Abergel, A.","Ali, B.","Anderson, L.","André, P.","Baluteau, J.-P.","Battersby, C.","Beltrán, M.

These data allow us to constrain the galaxy\u0027s spectral energy distribution (SED) and show that it has an intrinsic rest-frame 8-1000-μm luminosity, Lbol, of (2.3±0.2) × 1012  and a likely star-formation rate (SFR) of ~400  yr-1. The galaxy sits on the far-IR/radio correlation for far-IR-selected galaxies. At 70 μm, the SED can be described adequately by dust components with dust temperatures, Td ~ 30 and 60 k. Using SPIRE\u0027s Fourier- transform spectrometer (FTS) we report a detection of the [C ii] 158 μm cooling line. If the [C ii], CO and far-IR continuum arise in photo-dissociation regions (PDRs), we derive a characteristic gas density, n ~ 103 cm-3, and a far-ultraviolet (-UV) radiation field, G0, 103× stronger than the Milky Way. L[CII]/Lbol is significantly higher than in local ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) but similar to the values found in local star-forming galaxies and starburst nuclei. This is consistent with SMM J2135 being powered by starburst clumps distributed across ~2 kpc, evidence that SMGs are not simply scaled-up ULIRGs. Our results show that SPIRE\u0027s FTS has the ability to measure the redshifts of distant, obscured galaxies via the blind detection of atomic cooling lines, but it will not be competitive with ground-based CO-line searches. It will, however, allow detailed study of the integrated properties of high-redshift galaxies, as well as the chemistry of their interstellar medium (ISM), once more suitably bright candidates have been found.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ivison, R.

We focus on waveforms predicted by one of the PN approximants that has been proposed for use in gravitational-wave data analysis, restricted 3.5PN TaylorT1, and compare these with a section of the numerical waveform from the second to the eighth orbit, which is about one and a half orbits before merger. This corresponds to a gravitational-wave frequency range of Mω\u003d0.0455 to 0.1 Depending on the method of matching PN and NR waveforms, the accumulated phase disagreement over this frequency range can be within numerical uncertainty. Similar results are found in comparisons with an alternative PN approximant, 3PN TaylorT3. The amplitude disagreement, on the other hand, is around 6%, but roughly constant for all 13 cycles that are compared, suggesting that for the purpose of producing “hybrid waveforms,” only 4.5 orbits need be simulated to match PN and NR waves with the same accuracy as is possible with nine orbits.

In the outer regions of the remnant the 70-μm PACS image resembles the 24-μm image Spitzer image, with the emission attributed to the same warm dust component, located in the reverse shock region. At longer wavelengths, the three SPIRE bands are increasingly dominated by emission from cold interstellar dust knots and filaments, particularly across the central, western and southern parts of the remnant. Nonthermal emission from the northern part of the remnant becomes prominent at 500 μm. We have estimated and subtracted the contributions from the nonthermal, warm dust and cold interstellar dust components. We confirm and resolve for the first time a cool (~35 K) dust component, emitting at 70-160 μm, that is located interior to the reverse shock region, with an estimated mass of 0.075 .","bibo:AuthorList":["Barlow, M.

We detect a total of 541 starless cores in the entire ~11 deg2 area of the field imaged at 70–500 μm with SPIRE/PACS.

For confined QW polaritons, a second, anomalous, γx-induced dispersion branch arises and develops with increasing γx. In this case, the strong-weak coupling transition is attributed to γx\u003dγxtr or γ̃xtr, when the intersection of the normal and damping-induced dispersion branches occurs either in {k∥,Im[ω],Re[ω]} coordinate space (in-plane wave vector k∥ is real) or in {ω,Im[k∥],Re[k∥]} coordinate space (frequency ω is real), respectively. For the radiative states of QW excitons, i.e., for radiative QW polaritons, the transition is described as a qualitative change of the photoluminescence spectrum at grazing angles along the QW structure. We show that the radiative corrections to the QW exciton states with in-plane wave vector k∥ approaching the photon cone, i.e., at k∥→k0\u003d(ω0√εb)∕(ℏc) (εb is the background dielectric constant), are universally scaled by the energy parameter (Γ02ω0)1∕3 with Γ0 the intrinsic radiative width and ω0 the exciton energy at k∥\u003d0, rather than diverge. Similarly, the strong-weak coupling transition rates γxtr and γ̃xtr are also proportional to (Γ02ω0)1∕3. The numerical evaluations are given for a GaAs single quantum well with realistic parameters: Γ0\u003d45.5 μeV and (Γ02ω0)1∕3≈1.5 meV.","bibo:AuthorList":["Creatore, Celestino","Ivanov, Alexei L."],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevB.77.075324","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":32768,"sim:weight":0.437245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33391,"sim:weight":0.367126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32788,"sim:weight":0.358156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":301264,"sim:weight":0.331803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32775,"sim:weight":0.313042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15240,"sim:weight":0.311091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269537,"sim:weight":0.300422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66475,"sim:weight":0.288221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23890,"sim:weight":0.281553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26650,"sim:weight":0.278346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32789,"sim:weight":0.276484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32795,"sim:weight":0.274166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32786,"sim:weight":0.271493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32781,"sim:weight":0.258929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15320,"sim:weight":0.250455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448001,"sim:weight":0.249084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108107,"sim:weight":0.24553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32791,"sim:weight":0.239359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25921,"sim:weight":0.238685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32793,"sim:weight":0.220166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Five P3HT/PCBM chlorobenzene solutions with different P3HT concentrations (0, 33, 50, 67, 100 wt %) were spin coated on SiO2 substrates. The thick films (100 nm) were studied during annealing (50 min at 140 °C), with in situ synchrotron grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) and a sampling time \u003c8 s. For the first time, the evolution of the crystal structure is analyzed taking into account P3HT paracrystallinity. The following were observed: a predominance of edge-on P3HT lamellae in the as-spun and annealed films; changes in concentration-dependent edge-on lamellar orientation spread along the alkyl-stacking direction and paracrystalline disorder after annealing; a permanent lamellar stretching just along the alky-stacking direction after annealing; an increase in the P3HT domain size along only the alkyl-stacking direction for the edge-on lamellae, with dynamics consistent with PCBM acting as a plasticizer for P3HT; and finally, an increase in the PCBM concentration at the sample−air interface. We show that the paracrystalline correction is important to calculate correctly the domain size as deduced from GI-XRD","bibo:AuthorList":["Lilliu, Samuele","Agostinelli, Tiziano","Pires, Ellis John","Hampton, Mark David","Nelson, Jenny","Macdonald, John Emyr"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1021/ma102817z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9610813,"sim:weight":0.457749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108788,"sim:weight":0.137982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.132394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631529,"sim:weight":0.131128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631735,"sim:weight":0.129715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.123218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108107,"sim:weight":0.11626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.11598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113592,"sim:weight":0.109375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84924,"sim:weight":0.106449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108050,"sim:weight":0.105979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222993,"sim:weight":0.105544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.0965389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.0960211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76641,"sim:weight":0.0906946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85213,"sim:weight":0.0905307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108054,"sim:weight":0.08932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26627,"sim:weight":0.0889308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108077,"sim:weight":0.0875065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85659,"sim:weight":0.0871356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Quasi-one-dimensional double-row structures were found in the ordered, close-packed domains of the C8S matrix for each mixed monolayer system. These close-packed domains coexist with ordered striped phase domains (for C9S and C10S) or with a disordered phase (for C9S2 and C12S). Results from high-resolution images suggest that the double-rows are composed of inserted non-nearest-neighbor substitutional molecules, the ordering of which may be a result of locally induced surface stress.","bibo:AuthorList":["Xu, Gengzhao","Woodruff, D.

A propagating acoustic wave interacts with the TO phonons via anharmonic channels and opens band gaps in the TO-phonon polariton energy dispersion that results in pronounced Bragg scattering and reflection of the incoming light. The separation in frequency of different Bragg replicas, which is at the heart of acousto-optics, allows us to study the resonant acousto-optic effect in the most simple and efficient geometry of collinear propagation of electromagnetic and ultrasonic waves. The acoustically induced energy gaps, Bragg reflection spectra, and the spatial distribution of the electric field and polarization are calculated for CuCl parameters, in a wide range of frequencies and intensities of the pumping acoustic wave.

The evolution of the orbital phase and the emitted gravitational radiation are now known to a rather high order up to O(v8), v being the characteristic velocity of the binary. The orbital evolution, however, cannot be specified uniquely due to the inherent freedom in the choice of parameter used in the PN expansion, as well as the method pursued in solving the relevant differential equations. The goal of this paper is to determine the (dis)agreement between different PN waveform families in the context of initial and advanced gravitational-wave detectors. The waveforms employed in our analysis are those that are currently used by Initial LIGO/Virgo, that is, the time-domain PN models TaylorT1, TaylorT2, TaylorT3, the Fourier-domain representation TaylorF2 (or stationary phase approximant), and the effective-one-body model, and two more recent models, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt. For these models we examine their overlaps with one another for a number of different binaries at 2PN, 3PN, and 3.5PN orders to quantify their differences. We then study the overlaps of these families with the prototype effective-one-body family, currently used by Initial LIGO, calibrated to numerical-relativity simulations to help us decide whether there exist preferred families, in terms of detectability and computational cost, that are the most appropriate as search templates. We conclude that as long as the total mass remains less than a certain upper limit Mcrit, all template families at 3.5PN order (except TaylorT3 and TaylorEt) are equally good for the purpose of detection. The value of Mcrit is found to be ∼12M⊙ for Initial, Enhanced, and Advanced LIGO. From a purely computational point of view, we recommend that 3.5PN TaylorF2 be used below Mcrit and that the effective-one-body model calibrated to numerical-relativity simulations be used for total binary mass M\u003eMcrit.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buonanno, Alessandra","Iyer, Bala","Ochsner, Evan","Pan, Yi","Sathyaprakash, Bangalore Suryanarayana"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.80.084043","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24225,"sim:weight":0.375587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75618,"sim:weight":0.285665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Taskforce\u0027s goal is to be able to quickly calculate the impact of any mission design changes on LISA\u0027s science capabilities, based on reasonable estimates of the distribution of astrophysical sources in the universe. This paper describes our Taskforce\u0027s work on massive black-hole binaries (MBHBs). Given present uncertainties in the formation history of MBHBs, we adopt four different population models, based on (i) whether the initial black-hole seeds are small or large and (ii) whether accretion is efficient or inefficient at spinning up the holes. We compare four largely independent codes for calculating LISA\u0027s parameter-estimation capabilities. All codes are based on the Fisher-matrix approximation, but in the past they used somewhat different signal models, source parametrizations and noise curves. We show that once these differences are removed, the four codes give results in extremely close agreement with each other. Using a code that includes both spin precession and higher harmonics in the gravitational-wave signal, we carry out Monte Carlo simulations and determine the number of events that can be detected and accurately localized in our four population models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arun, K.

I focus on detecting bursts, i.e. short-duration signals, with optimal coherent data-analysis methods. I show that the polarization-averaged sensitivity of any network of identical detectors to any class of sources can be characterized by two numbers—the visibility distance of the expected source from a single detector and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a confident detection—and one angular function, the antenna pattern of the network. I show that there is a universal probability distribution function (PDF) for detected SNR values, which implies that the most likely SNR value of the first detected event will be 1.26 times the search threshold. For binary systems, I also derive the universal PDF for detected values of the orbital inclination, taking into account the Malmquist bias; this implies that the number of gamma-ray bursts associated with detected binary coalescences should be 3.4 times larger than expected from just the beaming fraction of the gamma burst. Using network antenna patterns, I propose three figures of merit (f.o.m.\u0027s) that characterize the relative performance of different networks. These measure (a) the expected rate of detection by the network and any sub-networks of three or more separated detectors, taking into account the duty cycle of the interferometers, (b) the isotropy of the network antenna pattern, and (c) the accuracy of the network at localizing the positions of events on the sky. I compare various likely and possible networks, based on these f.o.m.\u0027s. Adding any new site to the planned LIGO–VIRGO network can dramatically increase, by factors of 2–4, the detected event rate by allowing coherent data analysis to reduce the spurious instrumental coincident background. Moving one of the LIGO detectors to Australia additionally improves direction finding by a factor of 4 or more. Adding LCGT to the original LIGO–VIRGO network not only improves direction finding but will further increase the detection rate over the extra-site gain by factors of almost 2, partly by improving the network duty cycle. Including LCGT, LIGO-Australia, and a detector in India gives a network with position error ellipses a factor of 7 smaller in area and boosts the detected event rate a further 2.4 times above the extra-site gain over the original LIGO–VIRGO network. Enlarged advanced networks could look forward to detecting 300–400 neutron star binary coalescences per year.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schutz, Bernard Frederick"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1088/0264-9381","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631516,"sim:weight":0.264363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.211491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An increasing internal optical mode loss and an increasing lateral out-diffusion current are the significant processes in ridges of widths between 4 and 10 μm, with no significant contribution from a deteriorating gain-mode overlap. By fitting a diffusion length model to the lateral out-diffusion process, we extract the ambipolar diffusion length, Ld, as a function of intrinsic carrier injection-level which covers carrier densities appropriate for functioning light-emitting diode and laser devices. The measured dependence fits a diffusion mechanism involving the thermal redistribution of carriers via the wetting-layer and most significantly leads to two regimes where Ld can be reduced in self-assembled quantum-dot systems. Only one of these is shown to be beneficial to the overall efficiency of the device, while the other is at the expense of undesired high-order nonradiative recombination processes at high injection-levels. Covering a peak modal gain range of approximately 5 to 11 cm−1 over injection-levels of 65 to 122 meV at 350 K, this dependence caused Ld to change from 0.75 to 1.50 μm, with the maximum occurring at 84 meV where the peak modal gain is 6 cm−1. Decreasing the temperature to 300 K reduced Ld to \u003c0.75 μm over approximately the same injection-level range.","bibo:AuthorList":["Naidu, Deepal","Smowton, Peter","Summers, Huw David"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1063/1.3471812","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":28907,"sim:weight":0.278082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25920,"sim:weight":0.250689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32691,"sim:weight":0.247259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108775,"sim:weight":0.236866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108299,"sim:weight":0.220728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222847,"sim:weight":0.180289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22901,"sim:weight":0.166863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28584,"sim:weight":0.155937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.149448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As data from these detectors are starting to be analyzed, a renewed interest in this problem has been sparked. A Bayesian approach to the problem of coherently searching for gravitational wave bursts with a network of ground-based interferometers is presented here. We demonstrate how to systematically incorporate prior information on the burst signal and its source into the analysis. This information may range from the very minimal, such as best-guess durations, bandwidths or polarization content, to complete prior knowledge of the signal waveforms and the distribution of sources through spacetime. We show that this comprehensive Bayesian formulation contains several previously proposed detection statistics as special limiting cases, and demonstrate that it outperforms them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Searle, Antony C.","Sutton, Patrick","Tinto, Massimo"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1088/0264-9381","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631516,"sim:weight":0.192912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76543,"sim:weight":0.165665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.16378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They are necessary for the rapid identification of gravitational-wave burst candidates, which in turn will allow for follow-up observations by other observatories and the maximum exploitation of their scientific potential. A fully automated analysis would also circumvent the traditional \u0027by hand\u0027 setup and tuning of burst searches that is both labourious and time consuming. We demonstrate a fully automated search with X-Pipeline, a software package for the coherent analysis of data from networks of interferometers for detecting bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and other astrophysical triggers. We discuss the methods X-Pipeline uses for automated running, including background estimation, efficiency studies, unbiased optimal tuning of search thresholds and prediction of upper limits. These are all done automatically via Monte Carlo with multiple independent data samples and without requiring human intervention. As a demonstration of the power of this approach, we apply X-Pipeline to LIGO data to compute the sensitivity to gravitational-wave emission associated with GRB 031108. We find that X-Pipeline is sensitive to signals approximately a factor of 2 weaker in amplitude than those detectable by the cross-correlation technique used in LIGO searches to date.

Ionizing radiation plays a crucial role in star formation at all epochs. In contemporary star formation, ionization abruptly raises the pressure by more than three orders of magnitude; the temperature increases from ~  to ~ , and the mean molecular weight decreases by a factor of more than 3. This may result in positive feedback, either by compressing pre-existing clouds and rendering them unstable, or by sweeping up gravitationally unstable shells. It may also result in negative feedback (by dispersing residual dense gas). Ionizing radiation from OB stars is also routinely invoked as a means of injecting kinetic energy into the interstellar medium and as a driver of sequential self-propagating star formation in galaxies.\r\nAims. We describe a new algorithm for including the dynamical effects of ionizing radiation in SPH simulations, and we present several examples of how the algorithm can be applied to problems in star formation.\r\nMethods. We use the HEALPix software to tessellate the sky and to solve the equation of ionization equilibrium along a ray towards each of the resulting tesserae. We exploit the hierarchical nature of HEALPix to make the algorithm adaptive, so that fine angular resolution is invoked only where it is needed, and the computational cost is kept low.\r\nResults. We present simulations of (i) the spherically symmetric expansion of an HII region inside a uniform-density, non-self-gravitating cloud; (ii) the spherically symmetric expansion of an HII region inside a uniform-density, self-gravitating cloud; (iii) the expansion of an off-centre HII region inside a uniform-density, non-self-gravitating cloud, resulting in rocket acceleration and dispersal of the cloud; and (iv) radiatively driven compression and ablation of a core overrun by an HII region.\r\nConclusions.

It is written in Fortran 95/2003 and has been parallelised using OpenMP. SEREN is designed in a flexible, modular style, thereby allowing a large number of options to be selected or disabled easily and without compromising performance. SEREN uses the conservative “grad-h” formulation of SPH, but can easily be configured to use traditional SPH or Godunov SPH. Thermal physics is treated either with a barotropic equation of state, or by solving the energy equation and modelling the transport of cooling radiation. A Barnes-Hut tree is used to obtain neighbour lists and compute gravitational accelerations efficiently, and an hierarchical time-stepping scheme is used to reduce the number of computations per timestep. Dense gravitationally bound objects are replaced by sink particles, to allow the simulation to be evolved longer, and to facilitate the identification of protostars and the compilation of stellar and binary properties. At the termination of a hydrodynamical simulation, SEREN has the option of switching to a pure N-body simulation, using a 4th-order Hermite integrator, and following the ballistic evolution of the sink particles (e.g. to determine the final binary statistics once a star cluster has relaxed). We describe in detail all the algorithms implemented in SEREN and we present the results of a suite of tests designed to demonstrate the fidelity of SEREN and its performance and scalability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hubber, David Anthony","Batty, Christopher Peter","McLeod, Andrew","Whitworth, Anthony Peter"],"dc:date":"2011-05","doi":"10.1051/0004-6361","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85558,"sim:weight":0.272836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2300471,"sim:weight":0.210509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65893,"sim:weight":0.199689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2313076,"sim:weight":0.186363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2308839,"sim:weight":0.184913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176870,"sim:weight":0.183643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2305498,"sim:weight":0.17095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931240,"sim:weight":0.16795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85400,"sim:weight":0.163646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222902,"sim:weight":0.158352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75618,"sim:weight":0.152102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2311229,"sim:weight":0.13569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631466,"sim:weight":0.133413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176882,"sim:weight":0.13019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25806,"sim:weight":0.120301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86037,"sim:weight":0.114261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86033,"sim:weight":0.107466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109168,"sim:weight":0.102891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While scientists attest to the discovery of an underlying reality of complex inheritance — the so-called ‘witches’ brew’ of genetic and non-genetic factors — we argue that ‘complexity’ also performs rhetorical work. In our analysis of scientific review papers (1999—2008), we find a relatively stable genre of accountability in which descriptions of complexity appear to neutralize past failures by incorporating different and sometimes competing methodological perspectives. We identify two temporal strategies: retrospective accounting, which reconstructs a history of psychiatric genetics that deals with the recent failures, citing earlier twin studies as proof of the heritability of common psychiatric disorders; and prospective accounting, which engages in the careful reconstruction of expectations by balancing methodological limitations with moderated optimism. Together, these strategies produce a simple-to-complex narrative that belies the ambivalent nature of complexity. We show that the rhetorical construction of complexity in scientific review papers is oriented to bridging disciplinary boundaries, marshalling new resources and reconstructing expectations that justify delays in gene discovery and risk prediction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arribas-Ayllon, Michael","Bartlett, Andrew","Featherstone, Katie"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1177/0306312710363511","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86312,"sim:weight":0.191935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930163,"sim:weight":0.181409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.167587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67989,"sim:weight":0.148976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85489,"sim:weight":0.144752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.143117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.143117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.141904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Samples analysed were from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 190 deep subsurface sediments at three sites spanning the Nankai Trough in the Pacific Ocean off Shikoku Island, Japan. DNA was amplified, from three depths at site 1173 (4.15, 98.29 and 193.29 mbsf; metres below the sea floor), and phylogenetic analysis of clone libraries showed a wide variety of uncultured Bacteria and Archaea. Sequences of Bacteria were dominated by an uncultured and deeply branching ‘deep sediment group’ (53% of sequences). Archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were mainly within the uncultured clades of the Crenarchaeota. There was good agreement between sequences obtained independently by cloning and by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. These sequences were similar to others retrieved from marine sediment and other anoxic habitats, and so probably represent important indigenous bacteria. The mcrA gene analysis suggested limited methanogen diversity with only three gene clusters identified within the Methanosarcinales and Methanobacteriales. The cultivated members of the Methanobacteriales and some of the Methanosarcinales can use CO2 and H2 for methanogenesis. These substrates also gave the highest rates in 14C-radiotracer estimates of methanogenic activity, with rates comparable to those from other deep marine sediments.

In an attempt to determine which grassland management factors select for particular crenarchaeal community structures, soil microcosm experiments were performed examining the effect of increased pH, application of inorganic fertilizer (ammonium nitrate) and sheep urine deposition on both archaeal and bacterial communities in unmanaged grassland soil. As grassland management typically increases pH, a further experiment examined the effect of a reduction in pH, to that typical of unimproved grassland soils, on archaeal and bacterial communities. The RT-PCR amplification of 16S rRNA followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated a distinct and reproducible effect on bacterial communities after incubation for 28 or 30 days. In contrast, none of the treatments had a significant effect on the structure of the crenarchaeal community, indicating that these factors are not major drivers of crenarchaeal community structures in grassland soils","bibo:AuthorList":["Nicol, Graeme W.","Webster, Gordon","Glover, L.

Different 13C-labelled substrates (glucose, acetate and pyruvate) at low concentrations (100 µM) were used over a 7-day incubation to follow and identify carbon flow into different members of the community. Limited changes in total PLFA and bacterial 16S rRNA gene DGGE profiles over 7 days suggested the presence of a stable bacterial community. A broad range of PLFA were rapidly labelled (within 12 h) in the 13C-glucose slurry but this changed with time, suggesting the presence of an active glucose-utilizing population and later development of another population able to utilize glucose metabolites. The identity of the major glucose-utilizers was unclear as 13C-enriched PLFA were common (16:0, 16:1, 18:1ω7, highest incorporation) and there was little difference between 12C- and 13C-DNA 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles. Seemingly glucose, a readily utilizable substrate, resulted in widespread incorporation consistent with the higher extent of 13C-incorporation (∼10 times) into PLFA compared with 13C-acetate or 13C-pyruvate. 13C-PLFA in the 13C-acetate and 13C-pyruvate slurries were similar to each other and to those that developed in the 13C-glucose slurry after 4 days. These were more diagnostic, with branched odd-chain fatty acids (i15:0, a15:0 and 15:1ω6) possibly indicating the presence of Desulfococcus or Desulfosarcina sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sequences related to these SRB were in the 13C-acetate-DNA dsrA gene library. The 13C-acetate-DNA 16S rRNA gene library also contained sequences closely related to SRB, but these were the acetate-utilizing Desulfobacter sp., as well as a broad range of uncultured Bacteria. In contrast, analysis of DGGE bands from 13C-DNA demonstrated that the candidate division JS1 and Firmicutes were actively assimilating 13C-acetate. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis also confirmed the presence of JS1 in the 13C-DNA from the 13C-glucose slurry. These results demonstrate that JS1, originally found in deep subsurface sediments, is more widely distributed in marine sediments and provides the first indication of its metabolism; incorporation of acetate and glucose (or glucose metabolites) under anaerobic, sulfate-reducing conditions. Here we demonstrate that PLFA- and DNA-SIP can be used together in a sedimentary system, with low concentrations of 13C-substrate and overlapping incubation times (up to 7 days) to provide complementary, although not identical, information on carbon flow and the identity of active members of an anaerobic prokaryotic community.","bibo:AuthorList":["Webster, Gordon","Watt, Lynsey C.","Rinna, Joachim","Fry, John Christopher","Evershed, Richard P.","Parkes, Ronald John","Weightman, Andrew John"],"dc:date":"2006-09","doi":"10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01048.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9000536,"sim:weight":0.320341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26680,"sim:weight":0.248286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269539,"sim:weight":0.185152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631527,"sim:weight":0.180464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":661223,"sim:weight":0.155139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.154524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.152708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.152073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":661826,"sim:weight":0.145673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28941,"sim:weight":0.139969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55755,"sim:weight":0.135595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29438,"sim:weight":0.126218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The experiments followed the same general\r\nmethodology: participants responded to a visual target (a box on the screen) which was\r\nsometimes accompanied, or preceded, by a moving broadband auditory stimulus. For\r\nthe experiments in Chapter 2 the auditory stimulus started in one hemifield and moved\r\nto the other. The results indicated motor responses were facilitated when the auditory\r\nstimulus was moving azimuthally, to a greater degree than when it was static, but only\r\nwhen the direction of the auditory stimulus was opposite to that of the response\r\n(incongruent) and only for Experiment 2. Chapter 3 further examined this facilitation,\r\nwhilst restricting the movement of the auditory stimuli to either the left or right\r\nhemifield. The results indicated facilitation from bi-modal presentations, particularly\r\nwhen responses were towards the hemifield the auditory stimulus was presented in.\r\nExperiments 3 - 6 indicated responses were facilitated when the auditory stimulus and\r\nthe required motor response moved in the same direction. Finally, Chapter 4 utilised\r\nlooming auditory stimuli to test whether they led to greater facilitation than that\r\nobserved in Chapter 3. The results indicated looming auditory stimuli facilitated\r\nresponses relative to receding or static stimuli. There was also facilitation from bimodal\r\npresentations over their uni-modal counterparts, particularly when the responses\r\nwere towards the hemifield the auditory stimulus was presented in. There was\r\nfacilitation when the auditory stimulus moved in the opposite direction to the required\r\nresponse, compared to static, though only in Experiments 7 and 11.

The general principles that should be followed in designing machining strategies for such features are discussed in this article. Taking these general principles into account, new strategies are proposed to reduce the negative effects of identified factors on part quality and, at the same time, to overcome some of the problems associated with the use of conventional machining strategies for micromilling of ribs and webs. To implement and verify them, initially the milling operations were programmed manually, and then a special CAM module was developed for their automatic generation. Finally, this article reports the validation of the proposed strategies for machining thin features, which was carried out on a specially designed test part.","bibo:AuthorList":["Popov, Krastimir Borisov","Dimov, Stefan Simeonov","Pham, Duc Truong","Ivanov, Atanas"],"dc:date":"2006","doi":"10.1243/09544062JMES192","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108314,"sim:weight":0.18445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108622,"sim:weight":0.180069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222922,"sim:weight":0.16033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57236,"sim:weight":0.151823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795333,"sim:weight":0.141897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931857,"sim:weight":0.119432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.113451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821123,"sim:weight":0.10363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study utilises the Normalisation Process Model (NPM) to inform the process of implementation of collaborative care in both a future full-scale trial, and the wider health economy. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nApplication of the NPM to qualitative data collected in both focus groups and one-to-one interviews before and after an exploratory randomised controlled trial of a collaborative model of care for depression. \r\n\r\nResults\r\nFindings are presented as they relate to the four factors of the NPM (interactional workability, relational integration, skill-set workability, and contextual integration) and a number of necessary tasks are identified. Using the model, it was possible to observe that predictions about necessary work to implement collaborative care that could be made from analysis of the pre-trial data relating to the four different factors of the NPM were indeed borne out in the post-trial data. However, additional insights were gained from the post-trial interview participants who, unlike those interviewed before the trial, had direct experience of a novel intervention. The professional freedom enjoyed by more senior mental health workers may work both for and against normalisation of collaborative care as those who wish to adopt new ways of working have the freedom to change their practice but are not obliged to do so. \r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThe NPM provides a useful structure for both guiding and analysing the process by which an intervention is optimized for testing in a larger scale trial or for subsequent full-scale implementation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gask, Linda","Bower, Peter","Lovell, Karina","Escott, Diane","Archer, Janine","Gilbody, Simon","Lankshear, Annette Jean","Simpson, Angela E","Richards, David A"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1186/1748-5908-5-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999042,"sim:weight":0.388775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998566,"sim:weight":0.386739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.339474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23786,"sim:weight":0.311815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266583,"sim:weight":0.294381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.265352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76136,"sim:weight":0.247608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53693,"sim:weight":0.24606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108284,"sim:weight":0.237901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109025,"sim:weight":0.23546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.22129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76134,"sim:weight":0.215004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.205294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632061,"sim:weight":0.204602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.204532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107030,"sim:weight":0.202251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.19817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77721,"sim:weight":0.190716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.177833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.170792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Several different models of out-of-hours primary care now exist in the UK. Important outcomes of care include users’ satisfaction and enablement to manage their illness or condition, but the determinants of these outcomes in the unscheduled care domain are poorly understood. \r\nAim. To identify predictors of user satisfaction and enablement across unscheduled care or GP out-of-hours service providers in Wales. The design of the study is a cross-sectional survey. The setting of the study is nine GP out-of-hours services, three Accident and Emergency units and an all Wales telephone advice service in Wales. \r\nMethods. Postal survey using the Out-of-hours Patient Questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to fit both satisfaction and enablement models, based on demographic variables, service provider and treatment received and perceptions or ratings of the care process. \r\nResults. Eight hundred and fifty-five of 3250 users responded (26% response rate, range across providers 14–41%, no evidence of non-response bias for age or gender). Treatment centre consultations were significantly associated with decreased patient satisfaction and decreased enablement compared with telephone advice. Delays in call answering or callback for triage and shorter consultations were significantly associated with lower satisfaction. Waiting more than a minute for initial call answering was associated with lower enablement. \r\nConclusions. Giving users more time to discuss their illness in consultations may enhance satisfaction and enablement but this may be resource intensive. More simple interventions to improve access by quicker response and triage, and keeping users informed of waiting times, could also serve to increase satisfaction and ultimately impact on their enablement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kelly, Mark James","Egbunike, Jennifer Nkem","Kinnersley, Paul","Hood, Kerenza","Owen-Jones, Catrin Eleri","Button, Lori A.","Shaw, Christine","Porter, Alison","Snooks, Helen","Bowden, Sue","Edwards, Adrian G."],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1093/fampra","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.192489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55503,"sim:weight":0.181447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75350,"sim:weight":0.180137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.170895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.168733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77003,"sim:weight":0.161947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75575,"sim:weight":0.161044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.160905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780059,"sim:weight":0.157137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795345,"sim:weight":0.156587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.130265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.127585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.126154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.120001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Considerable changes have occurred over the last 5 years in the organization of out-of-hours care in the UK. Users’ experiences of their care are an important part of ‘quality of care’ and are valuable for identifying areas for improvement. \r\nAim. To identify strengths and weaknesses of out-of hours service provision in Wales. The design of the study is a cross-sectional survey. The setting of the study is nine GP services, three Accident and Emergency units and NHS Direct in Wales. \r\nMethod. Survey using the validated Out-of-Hours questionnaire. We identified the four most and least favourably rated items regarding users’ experience of care. These were analysed by type of care provided, telephone advice, treatment centre and home visit groups. \r\nResults. Eight hundred and fifty-five of 3250 users responded (26% response rate). Across providers and types of care, consistent strengths were the ‘manner of treatment by call operator’ and the ‘explanation of the next step by call operator’. Consistent weaknesses were the ‘speed of call back by the clinician’, the ‘information provided by the GP’, ‘getting medication after the consultation’ and ‘when to contact the (in-hours) GP’. \r\nConclusions. Users of out-of-hours care identify clear and consistent strengths and weaknesses of service provision across Wales. Specific areas for improvement concern the interface between in-hours care and out-of-hours care and between out-of-hours care and self-care. GP surgeries need to give better information on how to access the out-of-hours services. Out-of-hours providers should improve their advice on how and when to access in-hours surgeries and also improve the availability of medicines after out-of-hours consultations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kinnersley, Paul","Egbunike, Jennifer Nkem","Kelly, Mark James","Hood, Kerenza","Owen-Jones, Catrin","Button, Lori.

Patients were regularly discharged before being stabilised on Warfarin, pre-discharge information was not always given, patient-held records were not reliably completed nor follow-up arrangements made. At the ward level, there was some confusion about the responsibility for completing the yellow book on discharge and little awareness of the role of GPs in providing a monitoring service.

This thesis investigated community perceptions of an existing nearby nuclear power station at three locations, through a mixed-methods design incorporating a Q-Method study (n\u003d84) and a household study (n\u003d1,327), and with additional reference to an existing qualitative dataset. The thesis aimed to provide a detailed description of how such communities live with nuclear power. Specifically, it investigated (a) the main community points of view on the nearby nuclear power station; (b) the dimensionality of trust between communities and the power station; (c) the associations between risk perceptions, trust, sense of place, and residential proximity to the power station, and (d) the factors associated with community support for new nuclear build in the nearby area.\r\nFour points of view were identified. These were broadly consistent across study locations but also reflected some site-specific concerns. The dimensionality of trust between the nuclear power station and nearby communities was found to comprise separate Affective and Cognitive components. It was concluded, however, that the primary influences, both on public perceptions of the risks associated with the existing nuclear power station, and on community attitudes towards the building of a new one, were related to perceptions of place.\r\nThis thesis provides a contemporary insight into some of the ways that communities live in close proximity to a nuclear power station.

The main claim of the thesis is that individual differences reflect infants’ active\r\ninvolvement in their own developmental process. The thesis utilizes a combination of\r\nexperimental and parent report data to demonstrate the manifold nature of the origins of\r\nimitation.\r\nChapter one introduces the topic of individual differences in imitation by reviewing, in\r\nthe first part of the chapter, the literature on imitation during the first 18 months of life, and the\r\nliterature on the role of temperament in social-cognitive development, in the second part of the\r\nchapter. Furthermore, the open questions concerning the role of individual differences and the\r\ninfants’ active involvement in the development of imitation are discussed.\r\nChapter two studies the relation between attentional preferences and individual\r\ndifferences in imitation of facial and vocal models in the first few months of life. Thus far studies\r\nof early imitation have dismissed individual differences as noise, therefore not much is known\r\nabout the role of individual differences in imitation. The findings demonstrate that attentional\r\npreferences as measured with the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire-Revised (Gartstein \u0026\r\nRothbart, 2003) are related to specific differences in imitation. Furthermore the findings\r\ndemonstrate that the major theoretical accounts of imitation are not sufficient to explain these\r\nresults and a new theoretical model is proposed.\r\nIn chapter three the infant’s active involvement in its own developmental process is\r\nstudied by assessing the role of spontaneous imitation in the development of imitation of actions\r\non objects during the first year of life. I demonstrate that infants’ own initiative to imitate actions\r\non objects is the most important predictor of the observed increase in imitation of actions on\r\nobjects around 10- to12- months of age.\r\nV\r\nChapter four assesses the role of infant sociability in imitation. In particular, it examines\r\nthe hypothesis that sociability is related to faithful, but not selective, imitation. The findings\r\ndemonstrate a positive link between sociability, as measured by the surgency scale of the Early\r\nChildhood Behaviour Questionnaire (Putnam, Gartstein \u0026 Rothbart, 2006), and faithful\r\nimitation. Finally, in the general conclusion I will argue that the two current dominant accounts\r\nof imitation, i.e. an innate account and a learning account, do not account for these results, and I\r\nwill propose an alternative theoretical model that does account for these findings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hilbrink, Elma"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There is evidence that aggression may be a particular problem for young people who have been in care (‘care leavers’), and this may exacerbate their already high levels of mental health and social needs. Previous research has suggested that self-esteem may play an important role in aggression. However, the nature of this relationship is unclear and the research evidence is inconsistent. It has been proposed that some of the inconsistencies apparent in the existing research are due to the way that self-esteem has been conceptualised and measured. This research aimed to investigate the relationship between a number of different forms of self-esteem and aggression using a cross-sectional survey design. The study used self-report measures and implicit association tests (Greenwald et al., 1998) designed to assess implicit global self-esteem and implicit domains of self-esteem. The relationship between global self-esteem and aggression, domains of self-esteem (social rank, mate value and social inclusion) and aggression and discrepant explicit/implicit self-esteem (calculated by subtracting implicit self-esteem scores from explicit self-esteem scores) and aggression were investigated. When male and female data were analysed together there was a weak positive relationship between social rank and aggression but no other significant relationships. However when male and female data were analysed separately marked gender differences in the relationships between self-esteem and aggression emerged. For women, there were significant inverse correlations between self-reported aggression and three different forms of self-esteem: global self-esteem, social inclusion and discrepant implicit/explicit social inclusion. For men, there were significant positive relationships between self-reported aggression and four different forms of self-esteem: social rank, mate value, discrepant social rank, and discrepant mate value. The methodological, theoretical and clinical implications of this study are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Canning, Amy"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316090,"sim:weight":0.388825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.318361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23219,"sim:weight":0.280421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269586,"sim:weight":0.192593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.15643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104038,"sim:weight":0.126321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.122191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Appropriate and ethical management of these behaviours is important for the well-being of both the individual and direct-care staff. Positive Behavioural Support (PBS) is a values-based behavioural technology that has been found to be effective in supporting people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour and increasing their quality of life (e.g. Carr et al. 1999). However the application of PBS to real-world settings does not feature strongly in the research and therefore specific factors that contribute to the successful implementation of PBS have not been identified through research. Direct-care staff are crucial to implementing behavioural interventions with people with learning disabilities, yet their perspective is neglected in the literature. The main aim of the present study was to use qualitative methodology to explore the perspectives of direct-care staff working with PBS of what helps the successful implementation of PBS with people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour. The perspectives of clinicians working with direct-care staff were also explored with the aim of identifying the extent of agreement between direct-care staff and clinicians. This study used semi-structured interviews with direct-care staff, and a focus group with clinicians. Verbatim transcripts were then analysed using a Grounded Theory approach. From the analysis, six core concepts emerged. These were, ‘Service delivery’, ‘External support’, ‘Internal Support’, ‘Mediators’ and ‘Delivery of PBS’, all of which combined to affect the ‘Goodness of Fit’ of PBS. Some factors were considered more important than others, such as the relationship between clinician and direct-care staff, the commitment of the organisation to PBS and the attitude of direct-care staff. The factors were diverse and highlighted the complexity of implementing PBS in community settings. The implications of the study for both services and clinical practice were discussed and recommendations made.","bibo:AuthorList":["Woolls, Samantha"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631747,"sim:weight":0.462656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23851,"sim:weight":0.416929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77166,"sim:weight":0.320813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61005,"sim:weight":0.313324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632042,"sim:weight":0.30538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103804,"sim:weight":0.303331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316083,"sim:weight":0.292829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76136,"sim:weight":0.291694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.290276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.281852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77721,"sim:weight":0.28058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.277741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.249133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.244358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107030,"sim:weight":0.241745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76674,"sim:weight":0.218734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.209358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Surgical terminations of pregnancy represent an increasingly limited supply of donor cells due to the tendency towards performing medical termination in much of Europe. This imposes a severe constraint on further experimental and clinical cell transplantation research. Therefore, we explore here the feasibility of using medical termination tissue as a donor source. Products of conception were retrieved from surgical terminations over the last 7 years and from medical terminations over the last 2.5 years. The number of collections that yielded fetal tissue, viable brain tissue, and identifiable brain regions (ganglionic eminence, ventral mesencephalon, and neocortex) were recorded. We studied cell viability, cell physiological properties, and differentiation potential both in vitro and following transplantation into the central nervous system of rodent models of neurodegenerative disease. Within equivalent periods, we were able to collect substantially greater numbers of fetal remains from medical than from surgical terminations of pregnancy, and the medical terminations yielded a much higher proportion of identifiable and dissectible brain tissue. Furthermore, we demonstrate that harvested cells retain the capacity to differentiate into neurons with characteristics appropriate to the region from which they are dissected. We show that, contrary to widespread assumption, medical termination of pregnancy-derived fetal brain cells represent a feasible and more readily available source of human fetal tissue for experimental cell transplantation with the potential for use in future clinical trials in human neurodegenerative disease.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kelly, Claire M.","Precious, Sophie Victoria","Torres, Eduardo Miguel","Harrison, Alexander William John","Williams, Deborah","Scherf, Caroline","Weyrauch, Ulrike Marie","Lane, Emma Louise","Allen, Nicholas Denby","Penketh, Richard","Amso, Nazar Najib","Kemp, Paul J.","Dunnett, Stephen Bruce","Rosser, Anne Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.3727/096368910X546580","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26194,"sim:weight":0.187441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.173612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.152424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.148477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.145611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75567,"sim:weight":0.142973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.138842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.130508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77305,"sim:weight":0.129508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76581,"sim:weight":0.124628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.117609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.115667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.115667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.0999181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There is considerable evidence for endocrine disruption from aquatic ecosystems, but knowledge is lacking with regard to the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here, we show for the first time that birds foraging on invertebrates contaminated with environmental pollutants, show marked changes in both brain and behaviour. We found that male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) exposed to environmentally relevant levels of synthetic and natural estrogen mimics developed longer and more complex songs compared to control males, a sexually selected trait important in attracting females for reproduction. Moreover, females preferred the song of males which had higher pollutant exposure, despite the fact that experimentally dosed males showed reduced immune function. We also show that the key brain area controlling male song complexity (HVC) is significantly enlarged in the contaminated birds. This is the first evidence that environmental pollutants not only affect, but paradoxically enhance a signal of male quality such as song. Our data suggest that female starlings would bias their choice towards exposed males, with possible consequences at the population level. As the starling is a migratory species, our results suggest that transglobal effects of pollutants on terrestrial vertebrate physiology and reproduction could occur in birds.","bibo:AuthorList":["Markman, Shai","Leitner, Stefan","Catchpole, Clive","Barnsley, Sara","Müller, Carsten Theodor","Pascoe, David","Buchanan, Katherine L.","Clayton, Nicola Susan"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0001674","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52818,"sim:weight":0.315271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97721,"sim:weight":0.262252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108684,"sim:weight":0.212369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85054,"sim:weight":0.180936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.177637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84632,"sim:weight":0.174107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108766,"sim:weight":0.162861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.154209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29472,"sim:weight":0.138567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75573,"sim:weight":0.135144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.129749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77267,"sim:weight":0.122066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631955,"sim:weight":0.101312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We have constructed an outflow model for the H_2_O spectrum of W Hya, which successfully matches the fluxes of most of the observed H_2_O lines, using an adopted wind temperature profile. These fits are sensitive to the mass loss rate, to the H_2_O abundance and to the inner radius of the H_2_O emitting region. The best fit parameters correspond to a mass loss rate of 6x10^-7^Msun_/yr, inner and outer radii for the emitting region of 1.5x10^14^ and 1x10^16^cm, and a H_2_O/H_2_ abundance of 8x10^-4^ for r \u003c\u003d4.5x10^14^cm and 3x10^-4^ at large radii. A decrease of the H_2_O/H_2_ abundance in the outer envelope is consistent with the predictions of photochemical models. The availability for the first time of observations of the line fluxes from the dominant coolant species should enable improved models of the wind temperature distribution to be produced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barlow, M.

All the CO lines between J\u003d14-13 and J\u003d39-38 have been detected while lines of HCN with J_u_ as high as 48 have also been observed. The molecular emission arises from the warm and dense gas located in the innermost zone of the CSE. The CO and HCN emission can be easily explained if the vibrational and rotational temperatures are around 700-1500 K.

The microbial diversity in sediments from four different assemblages of chemosynthetic organisms, Mytilidae, Vesicomyidae, Sibogliniclae and a bacterial mat, was investigated using comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Aggregates of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-2) and bacteria of the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus cluster were found in all four chemosynthetic habitats. Fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ANME-2/Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus aggregates showed their presence few centimeters (3-5cm) below the surface of sediment. 16S rRNA gene sequences from all known marine ANME groups were detected in the pockmark sediments, as well as from both known bacterial partners. The archaeal diversity was limited to the ANME cluster for all investigated samples. The bacterial diversity included members of the Proteobacteria, Bacilliales, Cytophaga/Flavobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, JS1 and Actinobacteria clusters. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences related to those of known sulphide-oxidizing symbionts were recovered from tissues of several invertebrates including vesicomyid clams and siboglinid tubeworms of REGAB.

Research has been conducted into the impact of the diagnosis but little research has looked at the effect of the initial surgical repair. This study aimed to discover more about the experience of surgery and its impact on mothers. The study also focused upon whether factors such as attachment, loss of control and expectations of appearance were relevant.\r\n\r\nDesign: A qualitative methodology was chosen in order to allow participants to express their experiences in their own terms, rather than being bound by the researcher’s ideas or perceptions.\r\n\r\nMethod: Seven semi-structured interviews were conducted with mothers of babies with CLP who had had routine lip and/or palate surgery in the last three years. Mothers were recruited from the Cleft Lip and Palate Service based at the Morriston Hospital in Swansea. \r\n\r\nResults: Interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The super-ordinate themes which emerged were concerned with the Context of CLP, Emotions, Coping, the Impact of Others, Information and Expectations and Considerations of Surgery.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Implications for clinical practice included provision of reference information, more opportunities to share experiences with other parents, as well as the need to provide time for parents to spend time together. Emphasis was also placed on professionals maintaining a friendly and approachable attitude, which was highly valued. The need to spend time with families to better understand their concerns for surgery, their needs for information and their strategies for coping were also emphasised.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fletcher, Amy"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.260463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75307,"sim:weight":0.237682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76136,"sim:weight":0.231394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75869,"sim:weight":0.226695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75276,"sim:weight":0.225152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.21952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631721,"sim:weight":0.210798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631913,"sim:weight":0.205865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75298,"sim:weight":0.196215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.195953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75101,"sim:weight":0.189593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107030,"sim:weight":0.185167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76708,"sim:weight":0.181059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632042,"sim:weight":0.172983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.169376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.168096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For the rest of Earth\u0027s surface, we estimate the average heat flow for different geologic domains as defined by global digital geology maps; and then produce the global estimate by multiplying it by the total global area of that geologic domain. The averaging is done on a polygon set which results from an intersection of a 1 degree equal area grid with the original geology polygons; this minimises the adverse influence of clustering. These operations and estimates are derived accurately using methodologies from Geographical Information Science. We consider the virtually un-sampled Antarctica separately and also make a small correction for hot-spots in young oceanic lithosphere. A range of analyses is presented.

They are widely-regarded as the surface expression of upwelling mantle plumes. Hot-spots exhibit variable life-spans, magmatic productivity and fixity. This suggests that a wide-range of upwelling structures coexist within Earth\u0027s mantle, a view supported by geochemical and seismic evidence, but, thus far, not fully-reproduced by numerical models. Here, results from a new, global, 3-D spherical, mantle convection model are presented, which better reconcile hot-spot observations, the key modification from previous models being increased convective vigor. Model upwellings show broad-ranging dynamics; some drift slowly, while others are more mobile, displaying variable life-spans, intensities and migration velocities. Such behavior is consistent with hot-spot observations, indicating that the mantle must be simulated at the correct vigor and in the appropriate geometry to reproduce Earth-like dynamics. Thermally-driven mantle plumes can explain the principal features of hot-spot volcanism on Earth.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, David Rhodri","Davies, John Huw"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1016/j.epsl.2008.11.027","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66283,"sim:weight":0.343649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66282,"sim:weight":0.291974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66273,"sim:weight":0.269801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7585,"sim:weight":0.269575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7583,"sim:weight":0.249861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26713,"sim:weight":0.243444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108630,"sim:weight":0.194498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15210,"sim:weight":0.19251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66281,"sim:weight":0.187453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106911,"sim:weight":0.160734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66279,"sim:weight":0.157335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108347,"sim:weight":0.145964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109191,"sim:weight":0.144876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108063,"sim:weight":0.124896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66275,"sim:weight":0.115741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27271,"sim:weight":0.104161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85058,"sim:weight":0.0964448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The fact that the atmospheric abundance of 40Ar is only ~ 25% of the radiogenic gas produced inside Venus argues that Venus is not thoroughly degassed and its interior has not been dried over time. Therefore Venus must have lost its water very early in its history, before any significant 40Ar was produced. Current ideas suggest that Venus did not suffer a major impact. Therefore one would not expect it to have been substantially molten. As a result degassing all its water would be difficult and losing all the water without leaving oxygen in the atmosphere would also be very difficult.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the above difficulties in explaining a dry Venus interior, a new hypothesis is proposed that Venus formed by a near head-on collision of two large planetary embryos, as might be expected from favoured oligarchic planetary accretion. Such a collision would be sufficiently large to melt totally and briefly vapourise a significant proportion of both bodies. This would allow much of the released water to react rapidly with iron. Depending upon the reaction hydrogen is either expected to escape to space or enter the core. Oxygen would form FeO, most of which would enter the core, together with other iron reaction products. Most everything else not caught in the hydrodynamic escape driven by any hydrogen stream would be gravitationally retained by the final body. The model can therefore reconcile the 40Ar data, a virtually oxygen free atmosphere and a dry interior. An appropriate large collision also provides an easy explanation for the retrograde rotation of Venus. The possible implications for inner core and magnetic field formation; and atmosphere evolution including effects on D/H, C, N and inert gases are also discussed. A simple test of this hypothesis is that, in contrast to the current Venus paradigm, little or no hydrated minerals should be found on the surface.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, John Huw"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1016/j.epsl.2008.01.031","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86312,"sim:weight":0.229285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.175203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631546,"sim:weight":0.157984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108347,"sim:weight":0.155785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.154366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75333,"sim:weight":0.138384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26713,"sim:weight":0.131913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631819,"sim:weight":0.130713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108630,"sim:weight":0.12269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, we focus on understanding the influence of the magnitude of the Clapeyron slope (as measured by the Phase Buoyancy parameter, P) and the vigour of convection (as measured by the Rayleigh number, Ra) on mantle convection. We have undertaken 76 simulations of isoviscous mantle convection in spherical geometry varying Ra and P. Three domains of behaviour were found: layered convection for high Ra and more negative P, whole mantle convection for low Ra and less negative P and transitional behaviour in an intervening domain. The boundary between the layered and transitional domain was fit by a curve P \u003d αRaβ where α \u003d −1.05, and β \u003d −0.1, and the fit for the boundary between the transitional and whole mantle convection domain was α \u003d −4.8, and β \u003d −0.25. These two curves converge at Ra≈2.5×104 and P\u0026approx;−0.38. Extrapolating to high Ra, which is likely earlier in Earth history, this work suggests a large transitional domain. It is therefore likely that convection in the Archean would have been influenced by this phase change, with Earth being at least in the transitional domain, if not the layered domain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wolstencroft, Martin","Davies, John Huw"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.5194/sed-3-713-2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75703,"sim:weight":0.40286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66283,"sim:weight":0.306853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66273,"sim:weight":0.301862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66282,"sim:weight":0.276443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26000,"sim:weight":0.258017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26713,"sim:weight":0.248842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66281,"sim:weight":0.186059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109191,"sim:weight":0.149909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448009,"sim:weight":0.133535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Emotion matching can be defined as the ability to accurately copy the same facial configuration of another with, or without, experiencing the associated internal emotional state. Using a peek-a-boo emotion elicitation paradigm, this thesis explores the age at which infants first match emotional expressions, and whether this ability is affected by valence of matched expressions, or infant age. Additional analysis explores whether emotion matching is related to other forms of early matching behaviour. Emotion regulation can be defined as the ability to modify affective experience. This thesis outlines an experimental procedure for assessing whether infants use spontaneous blinking and gaze aversion to self-regulate the intensity of emotional experience. Potential relationships between emotion regulation and temperament, as well as other forms of regulatory behaviour, are also explored. In addition, links between emotion regulation and emotion matching are investigated. Results demonstrated that from 3-months-old infants are able to match both happy and sad emotional expressions, but that emotion matching ability selectively declines with age. Furthermore, emotion matching was found not to be related to other forms of early matching behaviour. Results also identified spontaneous blinking and gaze aversion as self-regulation strategies utilised in early infancy. In addition, a relationship was identified between regulation ability and higher scores of temperament shyness. However, emotion regulation was found not to be linked to other forms of regulatory behaviour. Finally, a potential relationship was identified between emotion regulation ability early in infancy and infant ability to match happy expression later in life. These results are considered in relation to previous literature, examining the processes and theories behind emotion matching and emotion regulation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fowler, Nia"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84835,"sim:weight":0.497333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66900,"sim:weight":0.455059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24368,"sim:weight":0.449498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108089,"sim:weight":0.283943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780053,"sim:weight":0.269517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85183,"sim:weight":0.261978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26439,"sim:weight":0.224151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388776,"sim:weight":0.201731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71305,"sim:weight":0.176794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23851,"sim:weight":0.157728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631699,"sim:weight":0.143219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108668,"sim:weight":0.136369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26757,"sim:weight":0.130675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85323,"sim:weight":0.129728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.128799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77248,"sim:weight":0.111645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25931,"sim:weight":0.105871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76934,"sim:weight":0.10533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22778,"sim:weight":0.0791169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this context, incentive-based regulations, in the form of price or\r\nquantity controls, can be envisaged as alternatives to mitigate these emissions. The use of environ-\r\nmental charges in air transport, and the inclusion of the sector in the European Union Emissions\r\nTrading Scheme (EU ETS), are considered under a range of scenarios. The impacts of these measures\r\non demand are estimated, and results suggest that they are likely to be minimalömainly due to the\r\nhigh willingness to pay for air transport. In particular, in the EU ETS scenario currently favoured by\r\nthe EU, demand reductions are less than 2%. This may not be true in the longer run, for short trips, or\r\nif future caps become more stringent. Furthermore, given current estimates of the social cost of CO2 as\r\nwell as typical EU ETS prices, supply-side abatement would be too costly to be encouraged by these\r\npolicies in the short term. The magnitude of aviation CO2 emissions in the EU is estimated, both in\r\nphysical and monetary terms; the results are consistent with Eurocontrol estimates and, for the EU-25,\r\nthe total social cost of these emissions represents only 0.03% of the region\u0027s GDP. It is concluded\r\nthat the use of multisector policies, such as the EU ETS, is unsuitable for curbing emissions from air\r\ntransport, and that stringent emission charges or an isolated ETS would be better instruments. However,\r\nthe inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS has advantages under target-oriented post-2012 scenarios, such\r\nas policy-costs dilution, certainty in reductions, and flexibility in abatement allocation. This solution is\r\nalso attractive to airlines, as it would improve their public image but require virtually no reduction of\r\ntheir own emissions, as they would be fully capable of passing on policy costs to their customers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mendes, Lucas M.

In this study we used the responses of people under 75 years of age (n \u003d 10,892). The response rate of this subgroup was 62.3%. All individual responses were geo-referenced to the 325 census enumeration districts of Caerphilly county borough.\r\nResults\r\nThe neighbourhood attributes of poor access to amenities, poor neighbourhood quality, neighbourhood disorder, lack of social cohesion, and neighbourhood deprivation were associated with the reporting of poor health. These effects were attenuated when controlling for individual and collective socio-economic status. Lack of social cohesion significantly increased the odds of women reporting poor health, but did not increase the odds of men reporting poor health. In contrast, unemployment significantly affected men\u0027s health, but not women\u0027s health.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis study shows that different aspects of the neighbourhood environment are associated with people\u0027s self rated health, which may partly reflect the health impacts of neighbourhood socio-economic status.

In addition, many individuals find it helpful to seek support from church leaders and congregations. However, few studies in the United Kingdom have explored how and why church leaders provide this support.\r\n\r\nThe study involved interviewing ten church leaders in south Wales regarding their experience of supporting congregants with mental health difficulties. Their accounts were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The results suggested that the leader’s concept of mental health difficulties was a major influence in the way in which support was provided. All the church leaders believed that mental health difficulties had a spiritual aetiology, but differed according to whether this was the main cause, or one of many. \r\n\r\nLeaders describe providing practical, spiritual, long-term and crisis support to individuals. Spiritual support was prominent and included counselling, bible teaching and prayer. The type of support available was influenced by the values the leaders held and the members of their congregation.\r\n\r\nChurch leaders varied regarding how much they perceived a need to access mental health services for congregants. The leader’s perception of their competency to support the individual and whether they had positive prior experience of mental health services influenced this. The majority of leaders felt under-trained to support people with mental health difficulties and unsure what the mental health services could provide. \r\n\r\nA number of barriers may prevent church leaders from accessing services such as feeling mutual suspicion between mental health professionals and the church. Consequently, many leaders recommended a Christian counsellor instead of mental health services.\r\n\r\nThis research suggests that church leaders provide a unique relationship for congregants, offering social support and hope. The implications of these findings for psychologists, mental health services and church leaders are discussed and recommendations for future research are made.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hurst, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77239,"sim:weight":0.26988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108530,"sim:weight":0.259437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222999,"sim:weight":0.255032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.250108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176831,"sim:weight":0.231194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76364,"sim:weight":0.218093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929823,"sim:weight":0.215022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.207428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631803,"sim:weight":0.199521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26084,"sim:weight":0.195353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176792,"sim:weight":0.192538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.192198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.187846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631739,"sim:weight":0.173624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108900,"sim:weight":0.170992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77318,"sim:weight":0.170861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.164653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77960,"sim:weight":0.147254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57364,"sim:weight":0.125372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The human TGF-β1 transcript is inherently poorly translated, and translational activation has been documented in relation to several stimuli. In this paper, we have sought to identify in cis regulatory elements within the TGF-β1 5′Untranslated Region (5′UTR). In silico analysis predicted formation of stable secondary structure in a G/C-rich element between nucleotides +77 to +106, and demonstrated that this element is highly conserved across species. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed the presence of secondary structure in this region. The proximal 5′UTR was inhibitory to translation in reporter gene experiments, and mutation of the secondary structure motif increased translational efficiency. Translational regulation of TGF-β1 mRNA is linked to altered binding of YB-1 protein to its 5′UTR. Immunoprecipitation-RT-qPCR demonstrated a high basal association of YB-1 with TGF-β1 mRNA. However, mutation of the secondary structure motif did not prevent interaction of YB-1 with the 5′UTR, suggesting that YB-1 binds to this region due to its G/C-rich composition, rather than a specific, sequence-dependent, binding site. These data identify a highly conserved element within the TGF-β1 5′UTR that forms stable secondary structure, and is responsible for the inherent low translation efficiency of this cytokine.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jenkins, Robert","Bennagi, Rasha","Martin, John","Phillips, Aled Owain","Redman, James Edward","Fraser, Donald James"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0012283","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77271,"sim:weight":0.141504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222903,"sim:weight":0.112229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105102,"sim:weight":0.111477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.108551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.107569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76242,"sim:weight":0.0963197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77174,"sim:weight":0.0923633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222792,"sim:weight":0.0911056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76535,"sim:weight":0.0878123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.086064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632033,"sim:weight":0.0827714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.08127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223000,"sim:weight":0.0794517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75588,"sim:weight":0.0788456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631517,"sim:weight":0.0770309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76666,"sim:weight":0.075834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.0685809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76532,"sim:weight":0.0659354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23816,"sim:weight":0.0657449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631653,"sim:weight":0.0580335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We have developed a cellular assay system that discriminates between fibroblasts from FRDA patients and unaffected donors on the basis of their sensitivity to pharmacological inhibition of de novo synthesis of glutathione. With this assay we observed that supplementation with selenium effectively improved the viability of FRDA fibroblasts, indicating that basal selenium concentrations are not sufficient to allow an adequate increase in the activity of certain detoxification enzymes (such as GPX). Furthermore, we characterized potential drug candidates and found that idebenone, a mitochondrially localized antioxidant that ameliorates cardiomyopathy in FRDA patients, as well as other lipophilic antioxidants protected FRDA cells from cell death.

A commonly used method to achieve this is the electrochemical reduction of diazonium compounds leading to radicals, followed by binding of the radicals to the support. In the present report, an alternative method using ultrasound at different frequencies (20, 582, 863, and 1142 kHz) to induce the surface grafting of nitrobenzene diazonium onto an ITO surface is described. It is shown that the grafting on ITO is more efficient in the lower ultrasonic frequency range that is ascribed to changes in the balance between the physical and chemical effects of cavitation with frequency. Both the physical and chemical effects of cavitation play important roles at all frequencies, but at high ultrasound frequencies, the physical effects are relatively small. At 20 kHz, the physical component, including mass transport, is larger than at higher frequencies, and mechanisms based on these observations have been proposed. Ultrasonic grafting has an advantage over electrografting in that it may provide more control over surface coverage, thus it is suggested that the ultrasonic method is used where the surface concentration of the organic layer must be controlled.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mirkhalaf, Fakhradin","Mason, Timothy J.","Morgan, David John","Saez, Veronica"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1021/la104402z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222831,"sim:weight":0.280786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222993,"sim:weight":0.275099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394889,"sim:weight":0.259274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631529,"sim:weight":0.258905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108116,"sim:weight":0.236168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780054,"sim:weight":0.197673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77031,"sim:weight":0.197306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631685,"sim:weight":0.19116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77025,"sim:weight":0.179546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.17734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76556,"sim:weight":0.174595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.161408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567269,"sim:weight":0.157231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26619,"sim:weight":0.148943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85937,"sim:weight":0.147359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75335,"sim:weight":0.142195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77211,"sim:weight":0.141753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26546,"sim:weight":0.1144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28352,"sim:weight":0.103993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85224,"sim:weight":0.0864911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Therapeutic targeting of bCSCs however, is hampered by their heterogeneity and resistance to existing therapeutics. In order to identify strategies to selectively remove bCSCs from breast cancers, irrespective of their clinical subtype, we sought an apoptosis mechanism that would target bCSCs yet would not kill normal cells. Suppression of the apoptosis inhibitor cellular FLICE-Like Inhibitory Protein (c-FLIP) partially sensitizes breast cancer cells to the anti-cancer agent Tumour Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL). Here we demonstrate in breast cancer cell lines that bCSCs are exquisitely sensitive to the de-repression of this pro-apoptotic pathway, resulting in a dramatic reduction in experimental metastases and the loss of bCSC self-renewal. \r\nMethods\r\nSuppression c-FLIP was performed by siRNA (FLIPi) in four breast cancer cell lines and by conditional gene-knockout in murine mammary glands. Sensitivity of these cells to TRAIL was determined by complementary cell apoptosis assays, including a novel heterotypic cell assay, while tumour-initiating potential of cancer stem cell subpopulations was determined by mammosphere cultures, aldefluor assay and in vivo transplantation. \r\nResults\r\nGenetic suppression of c-FLIP resulted in the partial sensitization of TRAIL-resistant cancer lines to the pro-apoptotic effects of TRAIL, irrespective of their cellular phenotype, yet normal mammary epithelial cells remained refractory to killing. While 10%-30% of the cancer cell populations remained viable after TRAIL/FLIPi treatment, subsequent mammosphere and aldefluor assays demonstrated that this pro-apoptotic stimulus selectively targeted the functional bCSC pool, eliminating stem cell renewal. This culminated in an 80% reduction in primary tumours and a 98% reduction in metastases following transplantation. The recurrence of residual tumour initiating capacity was consistent with the observation that post-treated adherent cultures re-acquired bCSC-like properties in vitro. Importantly however this recurrent bCSC activity was attenuated following repeated TRAIL/FLIPi treatment. \r\nConclusions\r\nWe describe an apoptotic mechanism that selectively and repeatedly removes bCSC activity from breast cancer cell lines and suggest that a combined TRAIL/FLIPi therapy could prevent metastatic disease progression in a broad range of breast cancer subtypes.

A range of organic compounds present in incense smoke have been identified using derivatisation reactions coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. A total of 20 polar organic compounds were positively identified in the samples, including the biomass burning markers levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan, as well as a number of aromatic acids and hydroxyls.

When considering the worldwide prevalence of incense-burning and resulting high respiratory exposures, the oxygenated organics identified in this study have significant human health implications, especially for susceptible populations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chuang, Hsiao-Chi","Jones, Timothy Peter","Chen, Yang","Bell, Jennifer","Wenger, John","Berube, Kelly Ann"],"dc:date":"2011-07-17","doi":"10.1007/s00216-011-5209-7","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9000834,"sim:weight":0.256988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":660412,"sim:weight":0.20568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":663009,"sim:weight":0.178866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000990,"sim:weight":0.173775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8754,"sim:weight":0.152306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000105,"sim:weight":0.147685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":660531,"sim:weight":0.133693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75677,"sim:weight":0.12357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":664649,"sim:weight":0.121677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780045,"sim:weight":0.0750037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The petrography, mineralogy, and geochemistry of coals and non-coal partings from the Suhe and Lilan coal mines of the Heshan Coalfield have been investigated using proximate, petrographic, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) techniques. The sulphur content in the coals (with ash less than 50%) ranges from 5.3% to 11.6%, of which more than 90% is organic sulphur, reflecting a strong marine water influence on the palaeomire. The high vitrinite reflectance (1.89–2.18%Romax) indicates that the coals in the Heshan Coalfield are mainly low-volatile bituminous coal. Microscopic observation has revealed that the coal is mainly composed of vitrinite and inertinite macerals with relatively low TPI and high GI values, suggesting an unusual, strongly alkaline palaeomire, with high pH. XRD analysis plus optical and scanning electron microscopy show that the minerals in these coals are mainly quartz, calcite, dolomite, kaolinite, illite, and pyrite, although marcasite, strengite, and feldspar, as well as some oxidised weathering products such as gypsum, are also present. Most trace elements in the Heshan coals are enriched with respect to their world mean, with Mo, U, and W highly enriched, more than 10 times their world means. The trace elements are believed to be associated either with organic compounds (Mo and U) or minerals such as aluminium–iron-silicates (Sc, Ge, and Bi), aluminium-silicates (Cs, Be, Th, Pb, Ga, and REE), iron-phosphates (Zn, Rb, and Zr), iron-sulphides (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Tl, and V), and carbonates (Sr, Mn, and W). Abnormally high organic sulphur content, high ash yields, relatively high GI values, very low TPI values, very high U contents, and very low Th/U ratios suggest that the Heshan coals accumulated in low-lying, marine-influenced palaeomires, developed on carbonate platforms. Many of these characteristics have also been recorded in the Tertiary coals of the circum-Mediterranean coal basins, where no marine influence is present. The similarities are thought to be produced by strongly alkaline groundwater chemistry, common to both environments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shao , Longyi","Jones, Timothy Peter","Gayer, Rod","Dai, Shifeng","Li, Shengsheng","Jiang, Yaofa","Zhang, Pengfei"],"dc:date":"2003","doi":"10.1016/S0166-5162","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2734391,"sim:weight":0.197994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826655,"sim:weight":0.195474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29473,"sim:weight":0.193888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55151,"sim:weight":0.193855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108851,"sim:weight":0.174966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29438,"sim:weight":0.171857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386082,"sim:weight":0.170367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631512,"sim:weight":0.161983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1480123,"sim:weight":0.158343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108794,"sim:weight":0.15441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108838,"sim:weight":0.148189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1153238,"sim:weight":0.145105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108630,"sim:weight":0.131397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1153139,"sim:weight":0.125231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384941,"sim:weight":0.124099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29431,"sim:weight":0.122991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27269,"sim:weight":0.117784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108742,"sim:weight":0.114153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Lloyds River Fault Zone, which separates the AAT from the Dashwoods microcontinent, yielded 40Ar/39Ar hornblende ages of ca. 470 Ma. The fault zone was intruded syn‐kinematically by the shoshonitic Portage Lake monzogabbro and the Pierre’s Pond suite, which gave U/Pb zircon ages of  Ma plus  Ma and  Ma, respectively. The Otter Pond granodiorite intruded syn‐kinematically into the Otter Brook Shear Zone, which separates the Annieopsquotch ophiolite belt from the structurally underlying ophiolitic Lloyds River Complex. It yielded a U/Pb zircon age of  Ma. The Buchans arc and its continental basement were accreted to the Lloyds River Complex prior to 468 Ma. Syn‐kinematic plutons have arc affinity, with εNd ranging between −0.9 and −6.8, and are coeval with the adjacent Notre Dame Arc. Our data thus suggest the majority of the AAT was accreted to the Dashwoods microcontinent by 468 Ma, when consanguineous, dominantly arclike plutons intruded within the AAT and adjacent Notre Dame Arc. The Portage Lake monzogabbro and Otter Pond mafic suite are more mafic than Notre Dame Arc plutons of similar age because of their intrusion into the thin, mafic crust of the AAT and ascent along shear zones. Our data indicate the formation and subsequent accretion of ophiolites and arc‐back‐arc complexes occurred within a very short time span (5–10 Ma). The sources of AAT syn‐orogenic magmatism are diverse and include melting of subarc mantle during slab breakoff, lithospheric mantle, and lower crust. The Ordovician Appalachian margin of Laurentia grew by the accretion of oceanic terranes and intrusion of mantle‐derived magma. Recycling of continental crust by rifting and subsequent collision played an important part of the tectonic evolution of the AAT.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lissenberg, Cornelis Johan","Zagorevski, Alexandre","McNicoll, Vicki J.","van Staal, Cees R.","Whalen, Joseph B."],"dc:date":"2005","doi":"10.1086/431909","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":385068,"sim:weight":0.281597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710135,"sim:weight":0.26391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710151,"sim:weight":0.248745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":703131,"sim:weight":0.205401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710152,"sim:weight":0.201057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106976,"sim:weight":0.197041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7583,"sim:weight":0.196267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7585,"sim:weight":0.19506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385954,"sim:weight":0.17648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66758,"sim:weight":0.148643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384194,"sim:weight":0.146674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710082,"sim:weight":0.12965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To help address this gap we present the following paleoceanographic proxy records from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1218 in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP): (1) stable isotope (δ18O and δ13C) records generated in epifaunal benthic foraminifera (Cibicidoides spp.) to improve (double the resolution) the previously published records; (2) δ18O and δ13C records measured on Oridorsalis umbonatus, a shallow infaunal species; and (3) a record of benthic foraminifera accumulation rate (BFAR). Our new isotope data sets confirm the existence at Site 1218 of a two-step δ18O increase. They also lend support to the hypothesized existence of a late Eocene transient δ18O increase and early Oligocene Oi-1a and Oi-1b glacial maxima. Our record of BFAR indicates a transient (∼500 kyr) twofold to threefold peak relative to baseline Oligocene values associated with the onset of Antarctic glaciation that we attribute to enhanced biological export production in the EEP. This takes the same general form as the history of opal accumulation in the Southern Ocean, suggesting strong high-to-low-latitude oceanic coupling. These findings appear to lend support to the idea that the EOT δ13C excursion is traceable to increased organic carbon (Corg) burial. Paradoxically, early Oligocene sediments in the EEP are extremely Corg-poor, and proxy records of atmospheric pCO2 indicate a transient increase associated with the EOT.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coxall, Helen Kathrine","Wilson, Paul A."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1029/2010PA002021","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23799,"sim:weight":0.320585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000685,"sim:weight":0.313162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29531,"sim:weight":0.310067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25050,"sim:weight":0.296373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002967,"sim:weight":0.28503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1477150,"sim:weight":0.278082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26935,"sim:weight":0.277196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23537,"sim:weight":0.269218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1491012,"sim:weight":0.268915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24620,"sim:weight":0.235061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15532,"sim:weight":0.212302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29452,"sim:weight":0.194524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23780,"sim:weight":0.190256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Past research asserted that as dementia progressed, people lost the capacity for awareness of themselves, others and their situation. However, emerging research has suggested that individuals can retain some capacity for awareness until the end of the disease process (Clare, 2010). Clare (2010) postulated that awareness operates hierarchically at increasing levels of complexity. She proposed a framework from which awareness can be understood and researched and identifies the biopsychosocial factors that influence its expression (Clare, 2004). \r\n\r\nThere is a lack of research investigating awareness as perceived by staff carers in specialist Elderly Mentally Infirm settings. Therefore, this current study utilises Clare’s (2010) framework to investigate staff perceptions of awareness in the moderate to late stages of dementia, using a Grounded Theory methodology. Understanding staff perspectives is important as responding appropriately to the needs of individuals with dementia is central to promoting quality care.\r\nThis study found that some staff members in specialist EMI settings, who provide direct care for people in the moderate to late stages of dementia, perceive residents to be unaware of themselves, others or their context. These findings are discussed in relation to current literature and the implications for clinical practice and staff training are outlined. A methodological critique acknowledges limitations of awareness research and of the current study and it is concluded that further research on awareness is vital for improving person-centred care in dementia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cooke, Deborah"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There are plausible links between attachment theory and schema theory, but research investigating them is in its infancy. If made clearer, such links may usefully guide therapeutic interventions for care leavers.\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this study was to investigate the self-reported psychological needs of care leavers. More specifically, the study aimed to examine the relationships between psychological distress, adult attachment, and early maladaptive schemas (EMS) in this group. The study also aimed to augment existing literature on the relationships between internal working models (IWMs) within attachment theory, and EMS within schema theory as conceptualised by Young et al. (2003). A total number of 50 care leavers aged 18-22 were recruited. They were all in contact with a leaving care team in one of five social services departments in South Wales. Self-report measures were used to assess psychological distress, adult attachment and EMS (considered within five schema domains).\r\n\r\nCare leavers with the highest reported levels of psychological distress also reported the highest degree of attachment anxiety (most negative IWMs of self), highest degree of attachment avoidance (most negative IWMs of others) and the most pronounced schema domains. Significant differences were observed in the reported levels of psychological distress and the prominence of schema domains in participants with different attachment styles, with most notable differences between the secure and fearful avoidant attachment style groups. Clinical and theoretical implications of the study findings are discussed in detail and areas for future research are suggested.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murphy, Rhian"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":22778,"sim:weight":0.314937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108996,"sim:weight":0.293512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77164,"sim:weight":0.272635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84835,"sim:weight":0.267948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.204217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631464,"sim:weight":0.193978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23467,"sim:weight":0.189001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631818,"sim:weight":0.174033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24364,"sim:weight":0.168697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23804,"sim:weight":0.163347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76578,"sim:weight":0.154065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.143007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.136305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76336,"sim:weight":0.134978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Unauthorised stocks of potassium chloride were found in five clinical areas not authorised by the trust (98% compliance). All trusts required documentation control of potassium chloride concentrate in clinical areas, but errors were recorded in 20 of the 207 clinical areas visited (90% compliance). Of those interviewed, 78% of nurses and 30% of junior doctors were aware of the alert. \r\n\r\nConclusions: The NPSA alert was effective and resulted in rapid development and implementation of local policies to reduce the availability of concentrated potassium chloride solutions. The success is likely to be partly due to the nature of the proposed changes and it cannot be assumed that future alerts will be equally effective.

Specifically focusing on the case study of Scotland – where Local Authorities are involved in a complex network of state and private governance initiatives – investigation reveals that despite various influences to the contrary, fair trade is strongly conflated with certification administered by the dominant global fair trade certifying body, Fairtrade International (FLO). However, exceptions are argued to demonstrate an active negotiation of this domination over meaning. In particular, one Authority has purchased ‘fairly traded’ Kilombero rice – produced by members of the National Smallholder Farmers Association of Malawi (NASFAM) – as part of its fair trade strategy, by accepting claims of fairness not on the basis of external certification, but on trust from a socially orientated import organisation.\r\n\r\nExtending the study along the supply chain, investigation reveals that while the producer organisation sees fair trade as beneficial to their overall objectives, they identify significant limitations with the FLO approach. For this reason they have pursued World Fair Trade Organisation (WFTO) accreditation in order to back their claims to fair trade operation. As such, the dominance of FLO certification is seen to be actively contested as part of a wider dynamic in which different approaches vie to influence the understanding, and therefore the praxis of stakeholders.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Alastair"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109067,"sim:weight":0.531749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9425340,"sim:weight":0.3932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65380,"sim:weight":0.340942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631615,"sim:weight":0.213313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.206516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.206516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222885,"sim:weight":0.205774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.196934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643996,"sim:weight":0.173072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.170925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26013,"sim:weight":0.144741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26012,"sim:weight":0.144741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Our understanding of the long-term paleoclimate evolution of the Arctic remains fragmentary but has advanced dramatically in the past decade through analysis of new marine and terrestrial records, supplemented by important insights from paleoclimate models. Improved understanding of how these observations fit into the long-term evolution of the global climate system requires additional scientific drilling in the Arctic to provide detailed and continuous paleoclimate records, and to resolve the timing and impact of key tectonic and physiographic changes to the ocean basin and surrounding landmasses.

It occupies only 26% of the global ocean area, and less than 10% of its volume [1]. However, it exerts a disproportionately large influence on the global climate system through a complex set of positive and negative feedback mechanisms directly or indirectly related to terrestrial ice and snow cover and sea ice. Increasingly, the northern high latitude cryosphere is seen as an exceptionally fragile part of the global climate system, a fact exemplified by observed reductions in sea ice extent during the past decades [2]. The paleoceanographic evolution of the Arctic Ocean can provide important insights into the physical forcing mechanisms that affect the form, intensity and permanence of ice in the high Arctic, and its sensitivity to these mechanisms in vastly different climate states of the past. However, marine records capturing the late Cenozoic paleoceanography of the Arctic are limited – most notably because only a single deep borehole exists from the central parts of this Ocean. This paper reviews the principal late Cenozoic (Neogene/Quaternary) results from the Arctic Coring Expedition to the Lomonosov Ridge and in light of recent data and observations on modern sea ice, outlines emerging questions related to three main themes: 1) the establishment of the \u0027modern\u0027 Arctic Ocean and the opening of the Fram Strait 2) the inception of perennial sea ice 3) The Quaternary intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciations.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Regan, Matt"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1088/1755-1315","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":386864,"sim:weight":0.426481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32061,"sim:weight":0.328234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.324909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108098,"sim:weight":0.31229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490161,"sim:weight":0.250711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To date, fixity of upwellings has only been shown in models of convection at either low-vigor or with layering, though studies where the lower mantle has high viscosity do frequently show upwellings with much lower drift velocities than the surface velocity. Since more vigorous convection traditionally shows more time dependence, fixity of upwellings has not been expected for nonlayered convection at Earth-like vigor; rather, we might expect slow but increasing drift velocities. I have undertaken numerical models of whole mantle convection in three-dimensional spherical geometry at approaching Earth-like vigor. Surprisingly, these simulations show prominent steady, virtually fixed, plumes arising from self-organization controlled by the smaller but numerous cold downwellings. If downwelling (subduction) dominates Earth\u0027s interior dynamics, then this work suggests that plume fixity need not require layering. The regular spacing and permanence of model upwellings contrast with observations of hot spots though. In these models, which do not simulate plates, the fixity and regular spacing result from the freedom of downwellings to occur everywhere except where plumes reach the surface. I suggest that on Earth this feedback is weakened by the presence of plates but that whole mantle thermal convection can still produce relatively fixed plumes, though we might expect them to be weaker, more mobile, and transient.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, John Huw"],"dc:date":"2005","doi":"10.1029/2005GC001042","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66273,"sim:weight":0.229481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66282,"sim:weight":0.218326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26933,"sim:weight":0.195815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26713,"sim:weight":0.189609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108630,"sim:weight":0.160225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67751,"sim:weight":0.159653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66281,"sim:weight":0.141869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108347,"sim:weight":0.127131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15210,"sim:weight":0.124731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.111837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.100347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.0953803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27271,"sim:weight":0.0803036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One potential way forward is to develop high-resolution models of the crust and upper mantle using other information. Here we describe the construction of a geodynamic a priori model of some aspects of upper mantle seismic velocity heterogeneity. It is based on an equal area tomographic grid and it has been produced at two scales, a 1° × 1° resolution at the equator, (i.e., each cell has an approximate dimension of 100 km by 100 km), and a 5° × 5° resolution at the equator. Both have a constant layer thickness of 100 km. Currently, the model accommodates the subducting lithosphere and global variation in continental crustal thickness and age of oceanic lithosphere. The shape of subducting oceanic lithosphere was derived from profiles through seismicity. The shape was combined with estimates of plate velocities and age of subducting lithosphere using an analytic solution of the thermal field to define the slab thermal anomaly. The temperature perturbation was converted to a slowness (1/velocity) perturbation. For oceanic lithosphere, a plate-cooling model was used to convert lithosphere age to slowness perturbation via a temperature perturbation. The variation in the thickness of continental crust, around a global average, formed the third element of the slowness perturbation model. This model has already been applied in a high-resolution mantle tomographic study of lower mantle heterogeneity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rhodes, Mark","Davies, John Huw"],"dc:date":"2004-03","doi":"10.1029/2003GC000622","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26564,"sim:weight":0.410497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66283,"sim:weight":0.398361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109191,"sim:weight":0.381493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26713,"sim:weight":0.350595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66282,"sim:weight":0.344952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66281,"sim:weight":0.342883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1476947,"sim:weight":0.325905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66289,"sim:weight":0.301857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710083,"sim:weight":0.301186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25990,"sim:weight":0.281809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7583,"sim:weight":0.27963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66275,"sim:weight":0.217266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66279,"sim:weight":0.21549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108063,"sim:weight":0.194997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108347,"sim:weight":0.186295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33738,"sim:weight":0.180543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27271,"sim:weight":0.14081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We do this by tracing a set of body‐waves used in global tomography studies through synthetic seismic models derived from mantle circulation models. The histograms of the arrival time residuals have a negative mean for all the models investigated. We interpret that this results from a predominance of rays sampling the fast structures of subduction zones due to the concentration of sources there. The interpretation successfully passes two tests; the first showed that the signal is tectonically controlled, while the second involved breaking the correlation between ray paths and structures when no bias is found.

To investigate whether rheology controls the thickness of the overriding plate\u0027s mechanical lithosphere in subduction zones, the thermal structure was modelled numerically assuming a temperature dependent mantle viscosity. It was found that the overriding lithosphere was ablated such that very high temperatures reached close to the surface near the apex of the wedge corner, leading to unrealistically high heat flow. Since temperature dependent rheology clearly does not control the thickness of the mechanical lithosphere, we suggest that it is instead controlled by buoyancy. The source of buoyancy we assume is compositional, e.g. buoyant crust. Two end‐member models with crustal thickness of 10 and 70 km respectively were then undertaken, these had lower heat flow. This work supports the assumption of some earlier workers (e.g. Plank and Langmuir, 1988) who equated the mechanical lithosphere with the crust of the overriding plate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rowland, Andrea","Davies, John Huw"],"dc:date":"1999-10-01","doi":"10.1029/1999GL005347","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15210,"sim:weight":0.284901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26713,"sim:weight":0.27633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710083,"sim:weight":0.268211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":303148,"sim:weight":0.237331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66283,"sim:weight":0.234181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109191,"sim:weight":0.227727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66281,"sim:weight":0.210062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7583,"sim:weight":0.202402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108347,"sim:weight":0.169276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1476947,"sim:weight":0.165357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66282,"sim:weight":0.129526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108630,"sim:weight":0.128672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27271,"sim:weight":0.125525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86229,"sim:weight":0.124899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The steady state thermal field is evaluated for a model subduction zone where the plates are prescribed by kinematic boundary conditions, such that the subducting slab induces a flow in the mantle wedge. The resulting model suggests that the oceanic crust of the downgoing slab is not melted extensively, if at all, and hence is not the source of subduction zone magmatism (with the possible exception of the special case of very young oceanic crust). The temperature in the mantle wedge is high enough to produce melting at the amphibole-buffered peridotite solidus. It is proposed that the combination of vertical motion of water as a free phase and the transport of hydrous phases (e.g., amphiboles) by the slab-induced mantle wedge flow lead to the net transport of water being horizontal, across the mantle wedge from the slab. Provided the subducting oceanic crust enters the asthenosphere at a velocity \u003e 6(±2) cm/yr, the mantle wedge will be hot enough at the limit of the lateral water transport mechanism to generate melting at the amphibole-buffered solidus. The model was then extended to include the effect of localized sources of buoyancy (melt, residue, etc.) as a stationary body force, to investigate the possibility of reversing the slab-induced flow. Best estimates of the buoyancy sources and appropriate viscosity in the wedge suggest that there is likely to be only a weak modulation of the slab-induced flow unless the slab and wedge are locally decoupled, for instance by shear heating, the presence of water, or dehydration/hydration reactions. If there is decoupling, then it is possible for there to be an appreciable reversal of the slab-induced flow. Such an appreciable reversal of flow, if it persists, leads to cooling of the mantle wedge. Hence flow reversal cannot be a steady state mechanism. Instead it would lead to a cycle in the melting with a period of O(l m.y.). The time dependence of a model with appreciable flow reversal would be reinforced by the need to clear the wedge of infertile material.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, John Huw","Stevenson, D.

This is particularly true of the selective laser sintering (SLS) process. In order for that process to be competitive and become a strong candidate for new applications, such as rapid manufacturing, the material used needs to be improved. The aim of the work presented in this thesis was to develop a new composite material made up of Polyamide 12 (a common SLS material) and cement, an inexpensive additive, for the purpose of improving the mechanical properties, as well as reducing the cost of the sintered components.\r\nAn experimental study was conducted of the thermal properties of the cement-Polyamide 12 composite material with different proportions of cement and Polyamide 12. The purpose of the study was to determine optimal SLS parameters to produce good quality fabricated SLS specimens. The research also involved an experimental investigation of the mechanical properties (Young‟s modulus, tensile, flexural, compression and impact strengths, and density) as a function of the proportion of cement additive to Polyamide 12. Finally, a method of quickly and inexpensively producing test specimens by casting instead of using SLS was developed and experiments conducted to demonstrate the similarity in properties between cast and SLS specimens.\r\nII\r\nThis research has shown that adding cement to Polyamide 12 yields a composite material that enables the production of sintered specimens with mechanical properties that are superior to those of pure Polyamide 12 specimens. As cement is much cheaper than Polyamide 12, the composite material is also obviously less expensive than pure Polyamide 12.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aldahsh, Saleh"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1394282,"sim:weight":0.301549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631076,"sim:weight":0.2857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631994,"sim:weight":0.193524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24911,"sim:weight":0.179876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76038,"sim:weight":0.178998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76680,"sim:weight":0.173101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54103,"sim:weight":0.171773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.170206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75527,"sim:weight":0.166818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75385,"sim:weight":0.124032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77263,"sim:weight":0.122349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573417,"sim:weight":0.0945708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Our main result is that the filaments seem to be characterized by a narrow distribution of widths with a median value of 0.10 ± 0.03 pc, which is in stark contrast to a much broader distribution of central Jeans lengths. This characteristic width of  ~0.1 pc corresponds to within a factor of  ~2 to the sonic scale below which interstellar turbulence becomes subsonic in diffuse gas, which supports the argument that the filaments may form as a result of the dissipation of large-scale turbulence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arzoumanian, D.","André, Ph.","Didelon, P.","Könyves, V.","Schneider, N.","Men’shchikov, A.","Sousbie, T.","Zavagno, A.","Bontemps, S.","Di Francesco, J.","Griffin, Matthew Joseph","Hennemann, M.","Hill, T.","Kirk, Jason M.","Martin, P.","Minier, V.","Molinari, S.","Motte, F.","Peretto, N.","Pezzuto, S.","Spinoglio, L.","Ward-Thompson, Derek","White, G.","Wilson, C.

The complete ~ 3.3° × 3.3° imaging with SPIRE 250/350/500 μm and PACS 70/160 μm allows a deep investigation of embedded protostellar phases, probing of the dust emission from warm inner regions at 70 and 160 μm to the bulk of the cold envelopes between 250 and 500 μm. We used a systematic detection technique operating simultaneously on all Herschel bands to build a sample of protostars. Spectral energy distributions are derived to measure luminosities and envelope masses, and to place the protostars in an Menv – Lbol evolutionary diagram. The spatial distribution of protostars indicates three star-forming sites in Aquila, with W40/Sh2-64 HII region by far the richest. Most of the detected protostars are newly discovered. For a reduced area around the Serpens South cluster, we could compare the Herschel census of protostars with Spitzer results. The Herschel protostars are younger than in Spitzer with 7 Class 0 YSOs newly revealed by Herschel. For the entire Aquila field, we find a total of ~45–60 Class 0 YSOs discovered by Herschel. This confirms the global statistics of several hundred Class 0 YSOs that should be found in the whole Gould Belt Survey.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bontemps, S.","André, Ph.","Könyves, V.","Men\u0027shchikov, A.","Schneider, N.","Maury, A.","Peretto, N.","Arzoumanian, D.","Attard, M.","Motte, F.","Minier, V.","Didelon, P.","Saraceno, P.","Abergel, A.","Baluteau, J.-P.","Bernard, J.-Ph.","Cambrésy, L.","Cox, P.","Di Francesco, J.","Di Giorgo, A.

In ellipticals hosting a radio galaxy, the far-infrared (FIR) emission is dominated by the synchrotron nuclear emission. The colour temperature of the cold dust is higher in quiescent E-S0a than in star-forming systems probably because of the different nature of their dust heating sources (evolved stellar populations, X-ray, fast electrons) and dust grain properties. In contrast to the colour temperature of the warm dust, the f350/f500 index sensitive to the cold dust decreases with star formation and increases with metallicity, suggesting an overabundance of cold dust or an emissivity parameter β \u003c 2 in low metallicity, active systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boselli, A.","Ciesla, L.","Buat, V.","Cortese, Luca","Auld, Robbie Richard","Baes, M.","Bendo, G.

Here we examine whether the spectral energy distribution (SED) and dust temperature of galaxies have strongly evolved over the last 80% of the age of the Universe. We discuss possible consequences for the determination of star-formation rates (SFR) and any evidence for a major change in their star-formation properties. We use Herschel deep extragalactic surveys from 100 to 500 μm to compute total IR luminosities in galaxies down to the faintest levels, using PACS and SPIRE in the GOODS-North field (PEP and HerMES key programs). An extension to fainter luminosities is done by stacking images on 24 μm prior positions. We show that measurements in the SPIRE bands can be used below the statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution is used, e.g. at 24 μm, to identify “isolated” galaxies whose flux is not boosted by bright neighbors. Below z ~ 1.5, mid-IR extrapolations are correct for star-forming galaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15 dex), therefore similar to z ~ 0 galaxies, over three decades in luminosity below the regime of ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs, LIR ≥ 1012 ). This narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range of physical processes that could have affected the SED of these galaxies. Extrapolations from only one of the 160 μm, 250 μm or 350 μm bands alone tend to overestimate the total IR luminosity. This may be explained by the lack of far-IR constraints around and above ~150 μm (rest-frame) before Herschel on those templates. We also note that the dust temperature of luminous IR galaxies (LIRGs, LIR ≥ 1011 ) around z ~ 1 is mildly colder by 10–15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ULIRGs at z ~ 1.6 (using a single modified blackbody-fit to the peak far-IR emission with an emissivity index of β \u003d 1.5). Above z \u003d 1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantially larger mid- over far-IR ratio, which could either result from stronger broad emission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden AGN. Two thirds of the AGNs identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavior as purely star-forming galaxies. Hence a large fraction of AGNs harbor coeval star formation at very high SFR and in conditions similar to purely star-forming galaxies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Elbaz, D.","Hwang, H.

We derive very high dust masses when graphite is used in our model to describe carbon dust. Using amorphous carbon, instead, requires less dust mass to account for submm emission due to its lower emissivity properties.

Herschel-SPIRE provides sampling of the far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of type 1 and type 2 AGN, allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust (starburst) emission. We study large samples of spectroscopically confirmed type 1 and type 2 AGN lying within the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aiming to understand their FIR colour distributions and constrain their starburst contributions. We find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed AGN in the HerMES fields have 5σ detections at 250 μm, in agreement with previous (sub)mm AGN studies. Their combined Spitzer-MIPS and Herschel-SPIRE colours (specifically S250/S70 vs S70/S24) quite clearly separate them from the non-AGN, star forming galaxy population, as their 24 μm flux is dominated by the hot torus emission. However, their SPIRE colours alone do not differ from those of non-AGN galaxies. SED fitting shows that all those AGN need a starburst component to fully account for their FIR emission. For objects at z \u003e 2 we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to the starburst component, LSB, and the AGN accretion luminosity, Lacc, with LSB  Lacc0.35. Type 2 AGN detected at 250 μm show on average higher LSB than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establish whether this trend indicates stronger star formation activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hatziminaoglou, E.","Omont, A.","Stevens, J.

These new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact young stellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. We compiled a sample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers the near-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. These were used to constrain key properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, and envelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. Several clusters are distinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinity of luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. The analysed protostellar population in Rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15  with luminosities between 1 and 150 , which extends the evolutionary diagram from low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. Some sources lack counterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth. The central cluster and the Phelps \u0026 Lada 7 cluster appear less evolved than the remainder of the analysed protostellar population. For the central cluster, we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as Class I from near- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate Class 0 objects. As a showcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- to intermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent different evolutionary stages from Class 0 to Class I. Their mid- to far-infrared spectral slopes flatten towards the Class I stage, and the 160 to 70 μm flux ratio is greatest for the presumed Class 0 source. This shows that the Herschel observations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution in detail.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hennemann, M.","Motte, F.","Bontemps, S.","Schneider, N.","Csengeri, T.","Balog, Z.","Di Francesco, J.","Zavagno, A.","André, Ph.","Men\u0027shchikov, A.","Abergel, A.","Ali, B.","Baluteau, J.-P.","Bernard, J.-Ph.","Cox, P.","Didelon, P.","di Giorgio, A.-M.","Griffin, Matthew Joseph","Hargrave, Peter Charles","Hill, T.","Horeau, B.","Huang, M.","Kirk, Jason M.","Leeks, S.","Li, J.

We use flux-limited 250-μm and 1.4-GHz samples, obtained using Herschel and the Very Large Array (VLA) in GOODS-North (-N). We determine bolometric IR output using ten bands spanning λobs \u003d 24–1250 μm, exploiting data from PACS and SPIRE (PEP; HerMES), as well as Spitzer, SCUBA, AzTEC and MAMBO. We also explore the properties of an LIR-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of qIR with redshift, spanning log LIR \u003d 11–12  and z \u003d 0–2, by stacking into the radio and far-IR images. For 1.4-GHz-selected galaxies in GOODS-N, we see tentative evidence of a break in the flux ratio, qIR, at L1.4 GHz ~ 1022.7 W Hz-1, where active galactic nuclei (AGN) are starting to dominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with redshift and Td. From our 250-μm-selected sample we identify a small number of far-IR-bright outliers, and see trends of qIR with L1.4 GHz, LIR, Td and redshift, noting that some of these are inter-related. For our LIR-matched sample, there is no evidence that qIR changes significantly as we move back into the epoch of galaxy formation: we find qIR (1+z)γ, where γ \u003d -0.04±0.03 at z \u003d 0–2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z \u003c 0.5 we find γ \u003d -0.26±0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radio background seen by ARCADE 2, perhaps driven by \u003c10-μJy radio activity amongst ordinary star-forming galaxies at z\u003e1.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ivison, R.

These data allow us to constrain the galaxy\u0027s spectral energy distribution (SED) and show that it has an intrinsic rest-frame 8-1000-μm luminosity, Lbol, of (2.3±0.2) × 1012  and a likely star-formation rate (SFR) of ~400  yr-1. The galaxy sits on the far-IR/radio correlation for far-IR-selected galaxies. At 70 μm, the SED can be described adequately by dust components with dust temperatures, Td ~ 30 and 60 k. Using SPIRE\u0027s Fourier- transform spectrometer (FTS) we report a detection of the [C ii] 158 μm cooling line. If the [C ii], CO and far-IR continuum arise in photo-dissociation regions (PDRs), we derive a characteristic gas density, n ~ 103 cm-3, and a far-ultraviolet (-UV) radiation field, G0, 103× stronger than the Milky Way. L[CII]/Lbol is significantly higher than in local ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) but similar to the values found in local star-forming galaxies and starburst nuclei. This is consistent with SMM J2135 being powered by starburst clumps distributed across ~2 kpc, evidence that SMGs are not simply scaled-up ULIRGs. Our results show that SPIRE\u0027s FTS has the ability to measure the redshifts of distant, obscured galaxies via the blind detection of atomic cooling lines, but it will not be competitive with ground-based CO-line searches. It will, however, allow detailed study of the integrated properties of high-redshift galaxies, as well as the chemistry of their interstellar medium (ISM), once more suitably bright candidates have been found.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ivison, R.

All of the extracted starless cores (541 in Aquila and 302 in Polaris) appear to form in the long and very narrow filaments.

Our first results of observations with Herschel enable us to suggest that in general dense cores may originate in a process of fragmentation of complex networks of long, thin filaments, likely formed as a result of an interplay between gravity, interstellar turbulence, and magnetic fields. To unravel the roles of the processes, one has to obtain additional kinematic and polarization information; these follow-up observations are planned.","bibo:AuthorList":["Men\u0027shchikov, A.","André, Ph.","Didelon, P.","Könyves, V.","Schneider, N.","Motte, F.","Bontemps, S.","Arzoumanian, D.","Attard, M.","Abergel, A.","Baluteau, J.-P.","Bernard, J.-Ph.","Cambrésy, L.","Cox, P.","Di Francesco, J.","di Giorgio, A.

Key core properties, such as bolometric luminosity and mass (as derived from spectral energy distributions), are used to constrain their evolutionary stages. We identify a handful of high-mass prestellar cores and show that their lifetimes could be shorter in the Rosette molecular complex than in nearby low-mass star-forming regions.

SPIRE maps now afford better characterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk, and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energetics than previously possible. They show emission coincident in projection with the starburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the PAH band emission seen with Spitzer. Some complex substructures coincide with the brightest PAH filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen. We subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk from the maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind and halo. We interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, and global physical conditions. In particular, we examine variations in the dust physical properties as a function of distance from the center and the wind polar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust has been removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roussel, H.","Wilson, C.

ISO and Spitzer studies have shown that much of the scatter in the mid-infrared colors of spiral galaxies is related to changes in the relative importance of these two components, rather than to other modifications, such as the morphological type or star formation rate, that affect the properties of the galaxy as a whole. With the Herschel imaging capability from 70 to 500 μm, we revisit this two-component approach at longer wavelengths, to see if it still provides a working description of the brightness distribution of galaxies, and to determine its implications on the interpretation of global far-infrared properties of galaxies.\u2029We quantify the luminosity of the central component by both a decomposition of the radial surface brightness profile and a direct extraction in 2D.

The Rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggered star-formation site. This is mainly due to its morphology, because the central OB cluster NGC 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and the expanding H II-region now interacts with the cloud.\r\nAims. Studying the spatial distribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites in Rosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will help to test the “triggered star-formation” scenario in Rosette.\r\nMethods. We use continuum data obtained with the PACS (70 and 160 μm) and SPIRE instruments (250, 350, 500 μm) of the Herschel telescope during the science demonstration phase of HOBYS.\r\nResults. Three-color images of Rosette impressively show how the molecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the NGC 2244 cluster. A clear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (running from the H II-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected. Studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale 0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) with increasing distance to the cluster NGC 2244. No clear gradient is found for the clump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution.\r\nConclusions. The existence of temperature and density gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation in Rosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central NGC 2244 cluster. A more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellar population in Rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schneider, N.","Motte, F.","Bontemps, S.","Hennemann, M.","Di Francesco, J.","André, Ph.","Zavagno, A.","Csengeri, T.","Men\u0027shchikov, A.","Abergel, A.","Baluteau, J.-P.","Bernard, J.-Ph.","Cox, P.","Didelon, P.","di Giorgio, A.-M.","Gastaud, R.","Griffin, Matthew Joseph","Hargrave, Peter Charles","Hill, T.","Huang, M.","Kirk, Jason M.","Könyves, V.","Leeks, S.","Li, J.

We compare these with expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties and biases in the SPIRE data. We identify a 500 μm flux limited selection of sources from the HerMES point source catalogue that appears free from neighbouring/blended sources in all three SPIRE bands. We compare the colours with redshift tracks of various contemporary models. Based on these spectral templates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types and redshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. The redshift tracks as well as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects with redshifts at 1 \u003c z \u003c 3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model SEDs used. We also find that a population of sources with S250/S350 \u003c 0.8 at fluxes above 50 mJy as observed by SPIRE are not well represented by contemporary models and could consist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schulz, B.","Pearson, C.

It contains a three-band imaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 μm, and an imaging Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS) covering 194–671 μm (447-1550 GHz). In this paper we describe the initial approach taken to the absolute calibration of the SPIRE instrument using a combination of the emission from the Herschel telescope itself and the modelled continuum emission from solar system objects and other astronomical targets. We present the photometric, spectroscopic and spatial accuracy that is obtainable in data processed through the “standard” pipelines. The overall photometric accuracy at this stage of the mission is estimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for the spectrometer. However, there remain issues with the photometric accuracy of the spectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the SPIRE spectrometer band. The spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to be better than 1/10th of the line FWHM. The astrometric accuracy in SPIRE maps is found to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. The photometric calibration of the SPIRE instrument is currently determined by a combination of uncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the data processing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. Improvements in processing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performance will lead to the final calibration accuracy of SPIRE being determined only by uncertainties in the models of astronomical standards.","bibo:AuthorList":["Swinyard, B.

The spectrum was obtained at a constant resolution of 1.4 GHz across the whole band. The flux from the planet is such that the instrument was operated in “bright source” mode to prevent saturation of the detectors. This was the first successful use of this mode and in this work we describe the method used for observing Mars together with a detailed discussion of the data reduction techniques required to calibrate the spectrum. We discuss the calibration accuracy obtained and describe the first comparison with surface and atmospheric models. In addition to a direct photometric measurement of the planet the spectrum contains the characteristic transitions of 12CO from J 5–4 to J 13–12 as well as numerous H2O transitions. Together these allow the comparison to global atmospheric models allowing the mean mixing ratios of water and 12CO to be investigated. We find that it is possible to match the observed depth of the absorption features in the spectrum with a fixed water mixing ratio of 1×10-4 and a 12CO mixing ratio of 9×10-4.","bibo:AuthorList":["Swinyard, B.

It will image the anisotropies of the CMB over the whole sky, with unprecedented sensitivity ( ~ 2 × 10-6) and angular resolution (~5 arcmin). Planck will provide a major source of information relevant to many fundamental cosmological problems and will test current theories of the early evolution of the Universe and the origin of structure. It will also address a wide range of areas of astrophysical research related to the Milky Way as well as external galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The ability of Planck to measure polarization across a wide frequency range (30-350 GHz), with high precision and accuracy, and over the whole sky, will provide unique insight, not only into specific cosmological questions, but also into the properties of the interstellar medium. This paper is part of a series which describes the technical capabilities of the Planck scientific payload. It is based on the knowledge gathered during the on-ground calibration campaigns of the major subsystems, principally its telescope and its two scientific instruments, and of tests at fully integrated satellite level. It represents the best estimate before launch of the technical performance that the satellite and its payload will achieve in flight. In this paper, we summarise the main elements of the payload performance, which is described in detail in the accompanying papers. In addition, we describe the satellite performance elements which are most relevant for science, and provide an overview of the plans for scientific operations and data analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tauber, J.

The study included five planktonic species from surface sediments from different geographical regions and water depths. Each of the laboratories followed their own cleaning and analytical procedures and had no specific information about the samples. Analysis of solutions of known Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios showed that the intralaboratory instrumental precision is better than 0.5% for both Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca measurements, regardless whether ICP-OES or ICP-MS is used. The interlaboratory precision on the analysis of standard solutions was about 1.5% and 0.9% for Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca measurements, respectively. These are equivalent to Mg/Ca-based temperature repeatability and reproducibility on the analysis of solutions of ±0.2°C and ±0.5°C, respectively. The analysis of foraminifera suggests an interlaboratory variance of about ±8% (%RSD) for Mg/Ca measurements, which translates to reproducibility of about ±2–3°C. The relatively large range in the reproducibility of foraminiferal analysis is primarily due to relatively poor intralaboratory repeatability (about ±1–2°C) and a bias (about 1°C) due to the application of different cleaning methods by different laboratories. Improving the consistency of cleaning methods among laboratories will, therefore, likely lead to better reproducibility. Even more importantly, the results of this study highlight the need for standards calibration among laboratories as a first step toward improving interlaboratory compatibility.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rosenthal, Yair","Perron-Cashman, S.","Lear, Caroline Helen","Bard, E.","Barker, Stephen","Billups, K.","Bryan, M.","Delaney, M.

This research will focus on the possibilities available for improving the\r\nmechanical properties and geometric accuracy of selective laser sintered parts produced\r\nfrom non-commercial polyamide 12 (PA12) composites. The specific material of\r\ninterest is PA 12 filled with glass beads. This thesis describes a study of the relationship\r\nbetween filler particles, the polymer matrix and processing parameters and their\r\ninfluence on the mechanical properties and geometric accuracy of the composite. The\r\naim of the study is to better understand the effect of coupling agents on the above\r\nmentioned properties as there is a lack of information in this area.\r\nMost of the experiments described in the thesis were performed with PA 12 filled with\r\ncoated and uncoated glass beads.

Under suitable processing conditions, the geometrical accuracy of\r\nsintered parts also improves with the addition of glass beads.

The novelty of the XFEM is the enrichment of the primary variables in the\r\nelements intersected by the discontinuity surface by appropriate functions. The enrichment\r\nscheme carries the local behaviour of the problem and the main advantage is that the\r\nmethod does not require themesh to conform to the internal boundaries. But this flexibility\r\ncomes with associated difficulties: (1) Blending problem; (2) Numerical integration of enrichment\r\nfunctions and (3) sub-optimal rate of convergence.\r\nThis thesis addresses the difficulty in the numerical integration of the enrichment functions\r\nin the XFEM by proposing two new numerical integration schemes. The first method relies\r\non conformal mapping, where the regions intersected by the discontinuity surface are\r\nmapped onto a unit disk. The second method relies on strain smoothing applied to discontinuous\r\nfinite element approximations. By writing the strain field as a non-local weighted\r\naverage of the compatible strain field, integration on the interior of the finite elements is\r\ntransformed into boundary integration, so that no sub-division into integration cells is required.\r\nThe accuracy and the efficiency of both the methods are studied numerically with problems\r\ninvolving strong and weak discontinuities. The XFEM is applied to study the crack\r\ninclusion interaction in a particle reinforced composite material. The influence of the crack\r\nlength, the number of inclusions and the geometry of the inclusions on the crack tip stress\r\nfield is numerically studied. Linear natural frequencies of cracked functionally graded material\r\nplates are studied within the framework of the XFEM. The effect of the plate aspect\r\nratio, the crack length, the crack orientation, the gradient index and the influence of cracks\r\nis numerically studied.\r\nLATEX-ed Friday, October 14, 2011; 10:55am\r\n© Sundararajan Natarajan","bibo:AuthorList":["Natarajan, Sundararajan"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85358,"sim:weight":0.515986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85751,"sim:weight":0.507764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5847473,"sim:weight":0.504373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15354,"sim:weight":0.435215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26027,"sim:weight":0.428227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316488,"sim:weight":0.331699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27098,"sim:weight":0.298366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316058,"sim:weight":0.293932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108134,"sim:weight":0.279977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.250696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.242332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26015,"sim:weight":0.199559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.198548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930220,"sim:weight":0.191447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26023,"sim:weight":0.171512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Glycaemic control, growth, weight gain, microvascular complications, school absence, and the proportion of children undergoing an annual clinical review and diabetes education session were assessed. The effect of the appointment of a PDSN on the frequency of hospital admission, length of inpatient stay, and outpatient attendance was evaluated. \r\n\r\nRESULTS Children with IDDM were of normal height and grew well for three years after diagnosis, but grew suboptimally thereafter. Weight gain was above average every year after diagnosis. Glycaemic control was poor at all ages with only 16% of children having an acceptable glycated haemoglobin. Eighty five per cent of patients underwent a formal annual clinical review, of whom 16% had background retinopathy and 20% microalbuminuria in one or more samples. After appointing the PDSN the median length of hospital stay for newly diagnosed patients decreased from five days to one day, with 10 of 24 children not admitted. None of the latter was admitted during the next year. There was no evidence of the PDSN affecting the frequency of readmission or length of stay of children with established IDDM. Non-attendance at the outpatient clinic was reduced from a median of 19 to 10%. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS Outcome measures for evaluating the care of children with IDDM can be defined and evaluated.

Medical interventions necessary to stabilise newly diagnosed diabetes depend upon the clinical condition of the child at presentation. Hospital admission is necessary if intravenous therapy is required to correct dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and ketoacidosis, with progression to oral fluids and subcutaneous insulin administration as the child’s condition improves. If the child is mildly to moderately symptomatic and clinically well, subcutaneous insulin and oral diet and fluids may be begun from the time of diagnosis, and stabilisation at diagnosis does not necessarily require hospital admission.

Hydrogenation is achieved by low‐energy ion irradiation from a Kaufman source. The volume incorporation of hydrogen, for equal treatment, is dependent upon the density of impurities and defects where H can bind. For moderate H treatment, in addition to passivation of shallow acceptors, in GaAs we observe novel emission bands, δ, peaking at 1.360, and γ, peaking at 1.455 eV. After heavy hydrogen treatment in GaAs of low radiative efficiency−even p type originally−there appears a deeper structure α at ∼1.20 eV, of the kind known for ‘‘internal’’ transitions in the Ga vacancy‐donor complex. Equivalent bands are found in bulk GaAlAs and also in InGaAs/GaAs MQWs. The results allow an approximate estimate of the various optically active Ga‐vacancy levels, as affected by the different degrees of hydrogenation of the dangling bonds, and a comparison with theoretical values. Moreover, they provide evidence for the creation of a H‐related donor whose binding energy is of order 25 meV. Finally, the γ band is suggestive of a transition between localized conduction and valence states associated with the local distortion that is introduced in the lattice when H binds to impurities, defects, and lattice atoms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Capizzi, M.","Coluzza, C.","Emiliani, V.","Frankl, P.","Frova, A.","Sarto, F.","Bonapasta, A.

Buccal cells are an attractive source of DNA, as their collection is non-invasive and can be carried out by mail. However, little attention has been given to the quality of DNA extracted from mouthwashes.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nMouthwash-derived DNA was extracted from 500 subjects participating in a genetic study of high myopia. DNA quality was investigated using two standard techniques: agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).\r\n\r\nPrincipal Findings\r\nWhereas the majority of mouthwash-derived DNA samples showed a single band of high molecular weight DNA by gel electrophoresis, 8.9% (95% CI: 7.1–10.7%) of samples contained only a smear of low-to-medium molecular weight, degraded DNA. The odds of DNA degradation in a subject\u0027s second mouthwash sample, given degradation of the first, was significantly greater than one (OR \u003d 3.13; 95% CI: 1.22–7.39; Fisher\u0027s test P \u003d 0.009), suggesting that DNA degradation was at least partially a subject-specific phenomenon. Approximately 12.4% (95% CI: 10.4–14.4%) of mouthwash-derived DNA failed to PCR amplify efficiently (using an ~200 bp microsatellite marker). However, we found there was no significant difference in amplification success rate between DNA samples judged to be degraded or non-degraded by gel electrophoresis (Fisher\u0027s test P \u003d 0.5).\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThis study demonstrated that DNA degradation affects a significant minority of saline mouthwashes, and that the phenomenon is partially subject-specific. Whilst the level of degradation did not significantly prevent successful amplification of short PCR fragments, previous studies suggest that such DNA degradation would compromise more demanding applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zayats, Tetyana","Young, T.

The\r\ndebate concerning where best to manage newly diagnosed children continues. Some units routinely admit\r\nchildren to hospital whilst others routinely manage children at home. A Cochrane review identified the need for a\r\nlarge well-designed randomised controlled trial to investigate any significant differences in comprehensive short\r\nand long-term outcomes between the two approaches. The DECIDE study will address these knowledge gaps,\r\nproviding high quality evidence to inform national and international policy and practice.\r\nMethods/Design: This is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial across eight UK paediatric diabetes centres.\r\nThe study aims to recruit 240 children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and their parents/carers. Eligible\r\npatients (aged 0-17 years) will be remotely randomised to either ‘hospital’ or ‘home’ management. Parents/carers of\r\npatients will also be recruited. Nursing management of participants and data collection will be co-ordinated by a\r\nproject nurse at each centre. Data will be collected for 24 months after diagnosis; at follow up appointments at 3,\r\n12 and 24 months and every 3-4 months at routine clinic visits.\r\nThe primary outcome measure is patients’ glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 24 months after diagnosis.\r\nAdditional measurements of HbA1c will be made at diagnosis and 3 and 12 months later. HbA1c concentrations\r\nwill be analysed at a central laboratory.\r\nSecondary outcome measures include length of stay at diagnosis, growth, adverse events, quality of life, anxiety,\r\ncoping with diabetes, diabetes knowledge, home/clinic visits, self-care activity, satisfaction and time off school/\r\nwork. Questionnaires will be sent to participants at 1, 12 and 24 months and will include a questionnaire,\r\ndeveloped and validated to measure impact of the diagnosis on social activity and independence. Additional\r\nqualitative outcome measures include the experience of both approaches by a subgroup of participants (n \u003d 30)\r\nand health professionals. Total health service costs will be evaluated. A cost effectiveness analysis will assess direct\r\nand indirect health service costs against the primary outcome (HbA1c).\r\nDiscussion: This will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate hospital and home management of\r\nchildren newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and the findings should provide important evidence to inform\r\npractice and national guidelines.\r\nTrial registration number: ISRCTN: ISRCTN78114042","bibo:AuthorList":["Townson, Julia","Gregory, John Welbourn","Cohen, David","Channon, Sue","Harman, N.","Davies, J.

Here we review advances on multiple fronts, most notably in neuroanatomy, animal studies and neuroimaging, that have highlighted the importance of the RSC for cognition, and consider why specifying its precise functions remains problematic.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vann, Seralynne Denise","Aggleton, John Patrick","Maguire, Eleanor A."],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1038/nrn2733","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86113,"sim:weight":0.248049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15399,"sim:weight":0.236024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108100,"sim:weight":0.232727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86733,"sim:weight":0.229042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6008,"sim:weight":0.225168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6024,"sim:weight":0.225168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86515,"sim:weight":0.200718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.197945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671625,"sim:weight":0.190593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1511490,"sim:weight":0.182978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733696,"sim:weight":0.182915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.182861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75275,"sim:weight":0.17506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":116134,"sim:weight":0.17433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14713,"sim:weight":0.169001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643975,"sim:weight":0.162173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.153597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108479,"sim:weight":0.153071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.143704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23814,"sim:weight":0.140786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the reasons for the severe memory loss in diencephalic amnesia remain unknown. A potential clue comes from the dense, reciprocal connections between the anterior thalamic nuclei and retrosplenial cortex, another region vital for memory. We now report a loss of synaptic plasticity [long-term depression (LTD)] in rat retrosplenial cortex slices months following an anterior thalamic lesion. The loss of LTD was lamina-specific, occurring only in superficial layers of the cortex and was associated with a decrease in GABAA-mediated inhibitory transmission. As retrosplenial cortex is itself vital for memory, this distal lesion effect will amplify the impact of anterior thalamic lesions. These findings not only provide novel insights into the functional pathology of diencephalic amnesia and have implications for the aetiology of the posterior cingulate hypoactivity in Alzheimer\u0027s disease, but also show how distal changes in plasticity could contribute to diaschisis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Garden, D.

This review examines the relative role of these structures in spatial memory tasks that are known to be hippocampal-dependent. The published lesion data gives a mixed picture, as only some studies detect spatial deficits after perirhinal cortex lesions. The possible reasons for these inconsistencies are reviewed, along with electrophysiological data that indicate how perirhinal cortex lesions may alter neuronal activity in the hippocampus. Overall, the disruptive effects of perirhinal lesions on spatial memory performance are, when they occur, typically transient and never as severe as those seen after hippocampal lesions. It is argued that parallel cortical routes provide key, sensory data to the hippocampus such that in the absence of the perirhinal cortex alternative information is available.

Although these three cases were poor on tests of learning and recall, there was evidence that recognition was less impaired.

Clear parallels were found between the apparent effects of fornix damage in these clinical cases and those observed following more selective surgery in non-human primates.

However, errors in the system significantly affect shoulder\r\nkinematics measurements.\r\nImage registration techniques (IRT) were developed to accurately measure GH\r\njoint kinematics using dynamic single-plane fluoroscopy. 3D computer bone\r\nmodels of the humerus and scapula were generated from magnetic resonance\r\nimaging (MRI) scans using Simpleware Software (Simpleware Ltd). Accurate\r\n3D to two dimensional ( 2D) image registration was performed using Joint-\r\nTrack software (Banks, S.A.). Full kinematics descriptions of the GH joint and\r\nof the scapula were obtained. The pattern of rotation agrees with what other researchers\r\nhave previously measured. Humeral head translation was measured\r\ntowards the glenoid centre (3�0.9mm medially, 2.7�0.9mm inferiorly and then\r\nsuperiorly and 6.7�2mm posteriorly) during abduction and (2.8�0.9mm medially,\r\n3.6�0.9mm superiorly and then inferiorly and 5.3�2.1mm anteriorly) during\r\nscaption. The centering of the humeral head is believed to provide joint congruency\r\nfor optimal shoulder function.\r\nTo investigate the errors commonly associated with MA, a comparison between\r\nthe kinematics outputs from the MA measuring system and IRT was performed.\r\nGreater GH joint elevation was recorded with IRT (54.8� and 82.6� for abduction\r\nand scaption respectively) compared to MA (51.1� and 75.2� for abduction and\r\nscaption respectively). Furthermore, differences between IRT and MA recordings\r\nin GH joint plane of elevation (6.7� and 1.9� abduction and scaption respectively)\r\nand axial rotation (24.1� and 23.0� abduction and scaption respectively)\r\nwere measured. Discrepancies in measured rotations between MA and IRT can\r\nbe attributed to factors related to differences in the analytical approach as well\r\nas the errors commonly associated with the techniques.\r\nAdditions and improvements to the original Cardiff MA protocol for measuring\r\nand analysing shoulder biomechanics were made and healthy and shoulder patient\r\nfunction was subsequently investigated. The glenohumeral (GH) joint centre\r\nof rotation (CoR) estimation by means of the instantaneous helical axis (IHA)\r\nmethod was included in the Cardiff model using International Shoulder Group\r\n(ISG) routines. With the original protocol, only regression equations (MRE)\r\nbased on scapula geometry were used to estimate GH joint CoR. Differences\r\nbetween IHA and MRE were investigated by comparing the estimated CoR positions\r\nrelative to the scapula anatomical coordinate system (ACS). The MRE\r\nsignificantly overestimated the GH joint CoR in the anterior position (by 4 cm)\r\ncompared to the IHA method and to the work of other research groups. The\r\niii\r\nMRE also estimated the GH joint CoR laterally to the scapula ACS although\r\nimaging studies identified GH joint CoR medially to the scapula ACS.\r\nTrunk contribution to overall arm elevation was assessed between unilateral\r\n(UE) and bilateral (BE) arm elevations. BE was found to significantly decrease\r\ntrunk lateral and axial rotation with respect to UE; however, trunk flexion was\r\nsignificantly greater. This in turn resulted in significantly different scapula rotations\r\nbetween UE and BE with up to 3� difference in scapula retraction during\r\nabduction between UE and BE. Consequently in shoulder complex biomechanics\r\nstudies, particular attention should be made to minimise trunk rotations.\r\nShoulder function asymmetry was investigated between dominant and nondominant\r\nshoulders. Significantly greater GH elevation and scapula lateral rotation\r\nwere measured in dominant arms compared to non-dominant arms, with a\r\ndifference of up to 7.6� and 7.0� respectively between the two arms. Asymmetry\r\nbetween the two shoulders could be attributed to soft tissue imbalance from\r\nmore frequent use of the dominant shoulder compared to the non-dominant.\r\nPhysiological range of motion (during static and dynamic trials) and 15 activities\r\nof daily living (ADLs) were recorded with skin markers attached to bony landmarks\r\nas well as with the AMC (and the SL for physiological ROMs). Static and\r\ndynamic trials measured differences in thorax and scapula rotations which may\r\nhave arisen from muscle stabilisation. Acromioclavicular (AC) and scapula lateral\r\nrotations were underestimated (by up to 8� and 20� respectively) using the\r\nskin fixed markers. Joint and segment rotations are comparable to published\r\nstudies that follow ISB recommendations\r\nThe kinematics of patients with four different shoulder conditions (clavicle fracture,\r\nmultidirectional instability, irreparable rotator cuff tear and GH dislocation)\r\nwas measured. The effect and the extent of the IoP was investigated during\r\nphysiological ROMs elevation and ADLs recordings by comparing their function\r\nto healthy and contralateral shoulders. The results from this study were used\r\nto develop a novel application for the Cardiff Dempster Shafer (DS) objective\r\nclassifier. The classification tool was used to characterise shoulder complex\r\nfunction of 40 participants. Non injured or pathological (NIoP) and IoP shoulder\r\nfunction was characterised with 72.5% accuracy. Eight patients were misclassified\r\nas having NIoP shoulder function while two healthy participants were\r\nmisclassified as having IoP function. A weak correlation between scoring questionnaires\r\nwith the NIoP and IoP classification indices was found (-0.16298 and\r\n0.180187 respectively). This might be explained by the subjective nature of the\r\nscores.\r\nThe studies described in this thesis contributed towards advancements in shoulder\r\ncomplex kinematics studies at Cardiff University as well as with the international\r\nshoulder researcher’s community. An appreciation was gained of the\r\nchallenges faced when using MA and IRT to measure shoulder motion as well\r\nas a better understanding of joint function in healthy and IoP shoulders.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stroud Larreal, Lindsay Ann"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Exposure to prenatal stress is associated with later adverse health and adjustment outcomes. This is\r\ngenerally presumed to arise through early environmentally mediated programming effects on the foetus. However,\r\nassociations could arise through factors that influence mothers’ characteristics and behaviour during pregnancy\r\nwhich are inherited by offspring.\r\nMethod. A ‘ prenatal cross-fostering ’ design where pregnant mothers are related or unrelated to their child as a\r\nresult of in vitro fertilization (IVF) was used to disentangle maternally inherited and environmental influences. If\r\nlinks between prenatal stress and offspring outcome are environmental, association should be observed in unrelated\r\nas well as related mother–child pairs. Offspring birth weight and gestational age as well as mental health were the\r\noutcomes assessed.\r\nResults. Associations between prenatal stress and offspring birth weight, gestational age and antisocial behaviour\r\nwere seen in both related and unrelated mother–offspring pairs, consistent with there being environmental links. The\r\nassociation between prenatal stress and offspring anxiety in related and unrelated groups appeared to be due to\r\ncurrent maternal anxiety/depression rather than prenatal stress. In contrast, the link between prenatal stress and\r\noffspring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was only present in related mother–offspring pairs and therefore\r\nwas attributable to inherited factors.\r\nConclusions. Genetically informative designs can be helpful in testing whether inherited factors contribute to the\r\nassociation between environmental risk factors and health outcomes. These results suggest that associations between\r\nprenatal stress and offspring outcomes could arise from inherited factors and post-natal environmental factors in\r\naddition to causal prenatal risk effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rice, Frances Jane","Harold, Gordon Thomas","Boivin, Jacky","Van den Bree, Marianne Bernadette","Hay, Dale F.","Thapar, Anita"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1017/S0033291709005911","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25906,"sim:weight":0.238457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77481,"sim:weight":0.147559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23821,"sim:weight":0.14511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22742,"sim:weight":0.143216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76340,"sim:weight":0.14062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26759,"sim:weight":0.125297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780051,"sim:weight":0.120228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77281,"sim:weight":0.109516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The development of these behaviours may reflect sensitization of the neural response to non-drug rewards, similar to that proposed for sensitization to drug rewards in addiction. Here, by using 11C-raclopride positron emission tomography imaging, we investigated the effects of reward-related cues and l-dopa challenge in patients with Parkinson’s disease with and without impulsive-compulsive behaviours on striatal levels of synaptic dopamine. Eighteen patients (11 with and seven without impulsive-compulsive behaviours) underwent three 11C-raclopride positron emission tomography scans. The impulsive-compulsive behaviours included hypersexuality, binge eating, punding, compulsive use of dopamine replacement therapy, compulsive buying and pathological gambling, with eight patients exhibiting more than one impulsive-compulsive behaviour. There were no significant differences in baseline dopamine D2 receptor availability between the Parkinson’s disease groups. No differences were found when comparing the percentage change of raclopride binding potential between the two Parkinson’s disease groups following l-dopa challenge with neutral cues. The group with Parkinson’s disease with impulsive-compulsive behaviours had a greater reduction of ventral striatum 11C-raclopride binding potential following reward-related cue exposure, relative to neutral cue exposure, following l-dopa challenge (16.3% compared with 5.8% in Parkinson’s disease controls, P \u003d 0.016). The heightened response of striatal reward circuitry to heterogeneous reward-related visual cues among a group of patients with different impulsive-compulsive behaviours is consistent with a global sensitization to appetitive behaviours with dopaminergic therapy in vulnerable individuals. Our findings are relevant for the broader debate on the relation between impulsive-compulsive behaviours and addictions and may have important implications with regards to advertisement legislation in an effort to prevent the onset of behavioural addictions.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Sullivan, S.

Drawing on focus groups discussions, content analysis and interviews with media personnel I demonstrate how template events help to shape news narratives and guide thinking not only about the past, but also of the present and the future. The argument is illustrated by examining the position of \u0027the Cleveland scandal\u0027 (and the subsequent \u0027Orkney crisis\u0027) in discussions of child sexual abuse. The discussion explores how templates such as \u0027Cleveland\u0027 are established and maintained by source strategies, social power relations and journalistic/audience reception processes, I also examine how templates operate in relation to existing theories around key events, framing and news icons. The article concludes by outlining the implications of templates for media production practice, media studies theory and audience reception research. Media templates are, I argue, a crucial site of media power, acting to provide context for new events, serving as foci for demands for policy change and helping to shape the ways in which we make sense of the world. The paradigmatic examples and associations which surround any particular issue can come to seem natural and inevitable. It is the task of media theorists, practitioners, policy makers and audiences to question how such accounts and links are constructed, to examine the conditions under which they are produced and reproduced, and to ask how they might be different.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kitzinger, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2000","doi":"10.1177/016344300022001004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Kitzinger.

Who is at risk? From whom? For professionals working in the field of child abuse, the main answers to such questions are straightforward. There is a broad consensus that children are at risk from adults (and young people), often from men (and sometimes women) that they know. Fathers, step-fathers, uncles and brothers are often implicated. This is not, however, the focus of news coverage. Abductions, paedophile rings and abuse in children\u0027s homes attract intermittent but occasionally intense media attention. In contrast, sexual abuse of children within their own families is rarely front page news—except, that is, where the accusations are contested. Almost as soon as the existence of widespread abuse within ‘ordinary’ homes became public knowledge, this was over-shadowed by a series of high-profiled ‘scandals’, such as Cleveland, Rochdale and Orkney. The focus turned to questions of misdiagnosis, inappropriate intervention and the supposed coaching of children to make false accusations. More recently ‘false memory syndrome’ has hit the headlines suggesting that some adults\u0027 accounts of abuse can also be discredited. The news coverage often gives the impression that the main risks are not tochildren, but to parents, particularly fathers. How has this come to be the focus of public debate?

In type 1 diabetes, clinical guidelines indicate that high-quality, child-centred information underpins achievement of optimal glycaemic control with the aim of minimising acute readmissions and reducing the risk of complications in later life. This paper describes the development of a range of child-centred diabetes information resources and outlines the study design and protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the information resources in routine practice. The aim of the diabetes information intervention is to improve children and young people\u0027s quality of life by increasing self-efficacy in managing their type 1 diabetes. METHODS/DESIGN: We used published evidence, undertook qualitative research and consulted with children, young people and key stakeholders to design and produce a range of child-centred, age-appropriate children\u0027s diabetes diaries, carbohydrate recording sheets, and assembled child-centred, age-appropriate diabetes information packs containing published information in a folder that can be personalized by children and young people with pens and stickers. Resources have been designed for children/young people 6-10; 11-15; and 16-18 years.To evaluate the information resources, we designed a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness, cost effectiveness, and implementation in routine practice of individually tailored, age-appropriate diabetes diaries and information packs for children and young people age 6-18 years, compared with currently available standard practice.Children and young people will be stratified by gender, length of time since diagnosis (\u003c 2 years and \u003e 2 years) and age (6-10; 11-15; and 16-18 years). The following data will be collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months: PedsQL (generic, diabetes and parent versions), and EQ-5 D (parent and child); NHS resource use and process data (questionnaire and interview). Baseline and subsequent HbA1c measurements, blood glucose meter use, readings and insulin dose will be taken from routine test results and hand-held records when attending routine 3-4 monthly clinic visits.The primary outcome measure is diabetes self-efficacy and quality-of-life (Diabetes PedsQL). Secondary outcomes include: HbA1c, generic quality of life, routinely collected NHS/child-held data, costs, service use, acceptability and utility.

In addition to optimal medical management, it is widely recognised that psychosocial and educational factors play a key role in improving outcomes for young people with diabetes. Recent systematic reviews of psycho-educational interventions recognise the need for new methods to be developed in consultation with key stakeholders including patients, their families and the multidisciplinary diabetes healthcare team.\r\n\r\nMethods/design\r\nFollowing a development phase involving key stakeholders, a psychosocial intervention for use by paediatric diabetes staff and not requiring input from trained psychologists has been developed, incorporating a communication skills training programme for health professionals and a shared agenda-setting tool. The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated in a cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT). The primary outcome, to be measured in children aged 4-15 years diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for at least one year, is the effect on glycaemic control (HbA1c) during the year after training of the healthcare team is completed. Secondary outcomes include quality of life for patients and carers and cost-effectiveness. Patient and carer preferences for service delivery will also be assessed. Twenty-six paediatric diabetes teams are participating in the trial, recruiting a total of 700 patients for evaluation of outcome measures. Half the participating teams will be randomised to receive the intervention at the beginning of the trial and remaining centres offered the training package at the end of the one year trial period.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe primary aim of the trial is to determine whether a communication skills training intervention for specialist paediatric diabetes teams will improve clinical and psychological outcomes for young people with type 1 diabetes.

Recent studies have challenged this theory by demonstrating that adolescents with both early- and adolescent-onset forms of conduct disorder show impaired emotional learning and abnormal neural activation during facial expression processing. The present study extends this work by investigating brain structure in both subtypes of conduct disorder.\r\n\r\nMethod:  \r\nVoxel-based morphometry was used to compare gray matter volumes in four regions of interest (amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex) in male adolescents with early-onset (N\u003d36) or adolescent-onset (N\u003d27) conduct disorder and in healthy comparison subjects (N\u003d27). Whole-brain structural analyses were also performed.\r\n\r\nResults:  \r\nThe combined conduct disorder group displayed gray matter volume reductions in the bilateral amygdala, extending into the insula, relative to healthy comparison subjects. Separate comparisons between healthy subjects and each conduct disorder subgroup revealed lower amygdala volume in both subgroups and reduced right insula volume in the adolescent-onset subgroup. Regression analyses within the conduct disorder subjects alone demonstrated a negative correlation between conduct disorder symptoms and right insula volume.\r\n\r\nConclusions:  \r\nThe results demonstrate that gray matter volume reductions in brain regions involved in processing socioemotional stimuli are associated with conduct disorder, regardless of age of onset. Brain structural abnormalities may contribute to the emergence of adolescent-onset as well as early-onset conduct disorder.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fairchild, G.","Passamonti, L.","Hurford, G.","Hagan, C.

While most accounts of diencephalic amnesia emphasize the functional importance of the hippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies, the present study tested the importance of the other major input to the mammillary bodies, the projections from the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden (VTNg). Although the VTNg, and its projections to the mammillary bodies, is present across species, the size and location of this structure has made it an extremely difficult structure to assess in primates. The effects of selective, neurotoxic lesions of the VTNg were, therefore, assessed in rats. The animals with these lesions were impaired on a series of spatial learning tasks, namely delayed-matching-to-place in the water maze, T-maze alternation and working memory in the radial arm maze. Normal performance on these tasks is dependent on those brain structures (e.g. hippocampus and mammillary bodies) that are now assumed to cause anterograde amnesia when damaged in humans. In contrast, the same rats with ventral tegmental nucleus lesions performed normally on two control tasks: the acquisition and subsequent reversal of an egocentric discrimination task and a visually cued task in the water maze. This study provides the first clear evidence that the VTNg is critical for memory, and consequently indicates that diencephalic–hippocampal models of memory should be extended to incorporate the limbic midbrain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vann, Seralynne Denise"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1093/brain","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86733,"sim:weight":0.314703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108100,"sim:weight":0.241758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":361076,"sim:weight":0.240709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.212783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87207,"sim:weight":0.194503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76305,"sim:weight":0.188648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86113,"sim:weight":0.185483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643975,"sim:weight":0.183857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.164662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.159329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.159329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85300,"sim:weight":0.157485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.15452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.15452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.152245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.152245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26514,"sim:weight":0.151111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6008,"sim:weight":0.147323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6024,"sim:weight":0.147323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23814,"sim:weight":0.147053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In vitro studies have shown that one of these snoRNA molecules, h/mbii-52, negatively regulates editing and alternative splicing of the serotonin 2C receptor (5htr2c) pre-RNA. However, the functional consequences of loss of h/mbii-52 and subsequent increased post-transcriptional modification of 5htr2c are unknown. 5HT2CRs are important in controlling aspects of cognition and the cessation of feeding, and disruption of their function may underlie some of the psychiatric and feeding abnormalities seen in PWS. In a mouse model for PWS lacking expression of mbii-52 (PWS-IC+/−), we show an increase in editing, but not alternative splicing, of the 5htr2c pre-RNA. This change in post-transcriptional modification is associated with alterations in a number of 5HT2CR-related behaviours, including impulsive responding, locomotor activity and reactivity to palatable foodstuffs. In a non-5HT2CR-related behaviour, marble burying, loss of mbii-52 was without effect. The specificity of the behavioural effects to changes in 5HT2CR function was further confirmed using drug challenges. These data illustrate, for the first time, the physiological consequences of altered RNA editing of 5htr2c linked to mbii-52 loss that may underlie specific aspects of the complex PWS phenotype and point to an important functional role for this imprinted snoRNA.","bibo:AuthorList":["Doe, Christine M.","Relkovic, Dinko","Garfield, Alastair S.","Dalley, J.

We offer a novel methodology to examine genetic and environmental influences on the intergenerational transmission of psychopathology using a sample of parents and children conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF).MethodThe sample included families with children born through IVF methods, who varied as to whether the child was genetically related or unrelated to the rearing mother and father (mother genetically related, n\u003d434; mother genetically unrelated, n\u003d127; father genetically related, n\u003d403; father genetically unrelated, n\u003d156). Using standardized questionnaires, mothers and fathers respectively reported on their own psychopathology (depression, aggression), their parenting behavior toward their child (warmth, hostility) and their child\u0027s psychopathology (depression, aggression). A cross-rater approach was used, where opposite parents reported on child symptoms (i.e. fathers reported on symptoms for the mother-child dyad, and vice versa).\r\n\r\nRESULTS: For mother-child dyads, a direct association between mother depression and child depression was observed among genetically unrelated dyads, whereas a fully mediated path was observed among genetically related dyads through mother-to-child hostility and warmth. For father-child dyads, direct and mediated pathways were observed for genetically related father-child dyads. For aggression, the direct association between parent aggression and child aggression was fully mediated by parent-to-child hostility for both groups, indicating the role of parent-to-child hostility as a risk mechanism for transmission.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: A differential pattern of genetic and environmental mediation underlying the intergenerational transmission of psychopathology was observed among genetically related and genetically unrelated father-child and mother-child dyads.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harold, Gordon Thomas","Rice, Frances Jane","Hay, Dale F.","Boivin, Jacky","Van den Bree, Marianne Bernadette","Thapar, Anita"],"dc:date":"2011-06","doi":"10.1017/S0033291710001753","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76340,"sim:weight":0.298756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76311,"sim:weight":0.241716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.225732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.21993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76809,"sim:weight":0.180468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108836,"sim:weight":0.180246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631901,"sim:weight":0.179941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85323,"sim:weight":0.154937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108088,"sim:weight":0.122951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26759,"sim:weight":0.106251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780051,"sim:weight":0.0761531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Finally, we provide a critical introduction to cutting edge methods from bayes optimal integration to multivoxel pattern analysis as applied to multisensory research at different system levels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Klemen, Jane","Chambers, Christopher D."],"dc:date":"2012","doi":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.04.015","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27005,"sim:weight":0.362337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86515,"sim:weight":0.196112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.190623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6008,"sim:weight":0.178966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6024,"sim:weight":0.178966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.173588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.173076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.1722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.1722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75275,"sim:weight":0.170283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.169514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.169514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733740,"sim:weight":0.168629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20346,"sim:weight":0.161676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86113,"sim:weight":0.158152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.157749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.157472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.157472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85083,"sim:weight":0.14136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.132542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In Section 1, we consider insights into the neural basis of inhibitory control from the effects of neural interference, neural dysfunction, and drug addiction. In Section 2, we explore the functional specificity of inhibitory mechanisms among a range of related processes, including response selection, working memory, and attention.

The ability to inhibit inappropriate or unwanted actions is a key element of executive control. The existence of executive function deficits in schizophrenia is consistent with frontal lobe theories of the disorder. Relatively few studies have examined response inhibition in schizophrenia, and none in adolescent patients with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS).\r\n\r\nMethods. Twenty-one adolescents with the onset of clinically impairing psychosis before 19 years of age and 16 matched controls performed a stop-signal task to assess response inhibition. The patients with EOS were categorized as paranoid (n\u003d10) and undifferentiated subtypes (n\u003d11). The undifferentiated group had higher levels of negative symptomatology. Stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) and go-signal reaction time (Go-RT) were analysed with respect to hand of response.\r\n\r\nResults. The undifferentiated early-onset patients had significantly longer SSRTs, indicative of poor response inhibition, for the left hand compared to the paranoid early-onset patients and control participants. No differences existed for inhibitory control with the right hand. The three groups did not differ in Go-RT.\r\n\r\nConclusions. Our results indicate a specific lateralized impairment of response inhibition in patients with undifferentiated, but not paranoid, EOS. These findings are consistent with reports of immature frontostriatal networks in EOS and implicate areas such as the pre-motor cortex and supplementary motor area (SMA) that are thought to play a role in both voluntary initiation and inhibition of movement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bellgrove, Mark A.","Chambers, Christopher D.","Vance, Alasdair","Hall, Nicole","Karamitsios, Mary","Bradshaw, John L."],"dc:date":"2005","doi":"10.1017/S0033291705006409","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":70652,"sim:weight":0.363381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645771,"sim:weight":0.316394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25888,"sim:weight":0.303234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109165,"sim:weight":0.215059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76305,"sim:weight":0.214466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645768,"sim:weight":0.207318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75899,"sim:weight":0.184214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848180,"sim:weight":0.171227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.166139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643975,"sim:weight":0.159102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.153357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.149296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76111,"sim:weight":0.128157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.124009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23814,"sim:weight":0.115124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75916,"sim:weight":0.111918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10862,"sim:weight":0.104256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.100806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.0889351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Case studies were constructed, based on the literature. It was found that emissions associated with domestic electrical and thermal demand would be reduced significantly.\r\nA Virtual Power Plant (VPP) was defined for aggregating micro-generators, using micro-generation penetration projections for the year 2030 from the literature. An optimisation problem was described, where the goal was to minimise the VPP carbon emissions. The results show the amount of emissions that would potentially be reduced by managing an existing micro-generation portfolio in a VPP.\r\nAn Environmental Virtual Power Plant (EVPP) was defined, for controlling micro-generator carbon emissions. A multi-agent system was designed. The principle of operation resembles an Emissions Trading Scheme. Emission allowances are traded by the micro-generators, in order to meet their emissions needs. Three EVPP control policies were identified. Fuzzy logic was utilised for the decision making processes. Simulations were performed to test the EVPP operation. The main benefit for the micro-generators is the ability to participate in markets from which they would normally be excluded due to their small size.\r\nThe multi-agent system was verified experimentally using micro-generation sources installed in two laboratories, in Athens, Greece. Two days of experiments were performed. Results show that system emissions have been successfully controlled, since only small deviations between desired and actual emissions output were observed. It was found that Environmental Virtual Power Plant controllability increases significantly by increasing the number of participating micro-generators.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skarvelis-Kazakos, Spyros"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15244,"sim:weight":0.388437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60528,"sim:weight":0.299816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76812,"sim:weight":0.262597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84850,"sim:weight":0.202565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386659,"sim:weight":0.188582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75791,"sim:weight":0.188259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":116975,"sim:weight":0.145452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this “cocktail-party” situation (Cherry 1953) listeners are helped by two binaural processes to segregate the desired voice from the competing noise: Better-Ear listening (BE) and Binaural Unmasking (BU). The aim of this thesis was to develop a model capable of efficiently predicting the benefits of BE and BU from Binaural Room Impulse Responses (BRIR). The developed model is a computationally efficient version of that created by Lavandier \u0026 Culling (2010) that predicts speech reception thresholds which include the benefit of binaural-unmasking, as explained by Equalization-Cancellation theory (Durlach 1963, 1972), and the benefit of better-ear listening, through Target-to-Interferer ratio analysis. The model accurately predicted a number of appropriate data sets from the literature that measure speech reception thresholds as a function of target and interferer source locations. Application of the model to a number of novel situations allowed environmental factors affecting intelligibility to be predicted and explored.\r\nIn most situations, the effect of reverberation is to reduce the level of BE and BU, except when the listener is close to the interfering source, but this is when the benefits are needed the most. Depending on the spatial separation and source distances, the inclusion of multiple interferers again reduces the benefits in the majority of situations. To examine the benefits of head orientation a number of configurations were tested, whilst rotating the listener relative to the sound field. Benefits exceeding 12 dB can be achieved through modest rotations, particularly showing the benefits of BE. According to the model, the current literature on the benefits of bilateral cochlear implantation has underestimated that benefit by employing sub-optimal spatial configurations; using optimum orientations the model predicts an extra 6 dB of benefit being available to the listener. In a simulated restaurant situation, the model predicts that orientation of a table can affect the ability of a listener by up to 5 dB.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jelfs, Sam"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24691,"sim:weight":0.298499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23835,"sim:weight":0.294525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77024,"sim:weight":0.284839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24116,"sim:weight":0.284688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24117,"sim:weight":0.263092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22720,"sim:weight":0.249881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999041,"sim:weight":0.222046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24051,"sim:weight":0.221377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77038,"sim:weight":0.216776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1925702,"sim:weight":0.212077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27922,"sim:weight":0.199167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998626,"sim:weight":0.194901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.193774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53670,"sim:weight":0.190609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Such reactions are used for the synthesis of important intermediates that can be used as precursors for the production of pharmaceutical, agrochemical and industrial products. However, many commercial processes to produce such materials still rely on technology that was developed many years ago. Such processes commonly lead to mixtures of regioisomers and in recent years several new approaches have been developed to gain control over the regiochemistry of the reactions. Zeolites can act as heterogeneous catalysts, support reagents, entrain by-products, enhance product para-selectivities via shape-selectivity and avoid aqueous work-ups. For example, zeolites can have advantages in para-regioselective nitration, halogenation, alkylation, acylation and methanesulfonylation reactions under modest conditions. Moreover, usually they can be easily removed from reaction mixtures by simple filtration and regenerated by heating and can then be reused several times to give almost the same yield and selectivity as fresh samples. This review surveys the use of zeolites as para-selective catalysts for a whole range of aromatic substitution reactions, based largely on our own work in the area, but set in the wider context of other related work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Keith","El-Hiti, Gamal A."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1039/C0GC00689K","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8821065,"sim:weight":0.211242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24646,"sim:weight":0.210881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848264,"sim:weight":0.189764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108317,"sim:weight":0.182506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76890,"sim:weight":0.165578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631992,"sim:weight":0.161752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631396,"sim:weight":0.157762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448027,"sim:weight":0.154278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631819,"sim:weight":0.145394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51634,"sim:weight":0.136558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10937,"sim:weight":0.11467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Gas adsorption can be controlled by the length and branching of the alkyl chains so that the apparent BET surface area of the materials can be tuned within the range 618−1760 m2 g−1. Shorter (e.g., methyl) or branched (e.g., isopropyl) alkyl chains provide the materials of greatest microporosity, whereas longer alkyl chains appear to block the microporosity created by the rigid organic framework. The enhanced microporosity, in comparison to other PIMs, originates from the macromolecular shape of the framework, as dictated by the triptycene units, which helps to reduce intermolecular contact between the extended planar struts of the rigid framework and thus reduces the efficiency of packing within the solid. The hydrogen adsorption capacities of the triptycene-based PIMs with either methyl or isopropyl substituents are among the highest for purely organic materials at low or moderate presures (1.83% by mass at 1 bar/77K; 3.4% by mass at 18 bar/77 K).

Polarized neutron diffraction revealed that the spin distribution is predominantly localized on the N and S atoms (+0.25μB and +0.28μB, respectively) of the heterocyclic ring with a small negative spin density on the heterocyclic C atom (−0.06μB). These spin populations are in excellent agreement with both ab initio DFT calculations (spin populations on the C, N, and S sites of −0.07, 0.22 and 0.31, respectively) and cw-EPR studies which estimated the spin population on the N site as 0.24. The DFT calculated spin density revealed less than 1% spin delocalization onto the perfluoroaryl ring, several orders of magnitude lower than the density on the heterocyclic ring. cw-ENDOR studies at both X-band (9 GHz) and Q-band (34 GHz) frequencies probed the spin populations on the two chemically distinct F atoms.

The specific order in which the alkane and alcohol are added during the reduction step was found to have a remarkable influence on the precursor morphology and eventual catalytic activity of the final (VO)2P2O7 catalyst. Without the addition of n-octane the product consists of typical rosette-type VOHPO4·0.5H2O and n-octane addition after the reduction step does not significantly change the precursor morphology. By way of contrast, the addition of the n-octane before the reduction step leads to the formation of octagonal VOPO4·2H2O platelets which are then subsequently reduced by 1-butanol to form nanoscale rhomboidal VOHPO4·0.5H2O platelets. The co-addition of n-octane and 1-butanol, on the other hand, can reduce and reform the square VOPO4·2H2O crystals into rosette-type aggregates of angular VOHPO4·0.5H2O platelets. Nearly all of the catalysts generated exhibit a high activity and selectivity to maleic anhydride. The only exception is the catalyst produced by activating the nanoscale rhomboidal morphology precursor, which is attributed to its poorer crystallinity and more limited exposure of the active (100) (VO)2P2O7 plane. Furthermore, the spatial orientation relationship between the starting VOPO4·2H2O crystal and the VOHPO4·0.5H2O precursor phase has been indentified in this study as [001]VOPO4·2H2O//[001]VOHPO4·0.5H2O and [100]VOPO4·2H2O//[110]VOHPO4·0.5H2O.

Out-of-hours services for primary care provision are increasing in policy relevance. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore service users’ recent experiences of out-of-hours services and to identify suggestions for improvement for services and practitioners involved. \r\nMethods. We used data from a cross-sectional survey of service users’ self-reported experiences of 13 out-of-hours centres in Wales. Three hundred and forty-one respondents provided free-text comments focusing on suggestions for improvement within the survey instrument (the Out-of-hours Patient Questionnaire). A coding framework was based on previous literature focusing on patients’ experiences of out-of-hours services, built upon and refined as it was systematically applied to the data. Emergent themes and subthemes were charted and interpreted to comprise the findings. \r\nResults. Central themes emerged from users’ perspectives of the structure of out-of-hours services, process of care and outcomes for users. Themes included long waiting times, perceived quality of service user–practitioner communication, consideration for parents and children and accessibility of the service and medication. Suggestions for improving care were made across these themes, including triaging patients more effectively and efficiently, addressing specific aspects of practitioners’ communication with patients, reconsidering the size of areas covered by services and number of professionals required for the population covered, extending GP and pharmacy opening times and medication delivery services. \r\nConclusions.

However, our knowledge on the concept is currently limited in several respects.  This includes a paucity of de-tailed accounts of how city-regions are formed and an over-reliance in existing analyses which consider city-regions as contingent responses to globalising economic impera-tives.  \r\n\r\nThe main aim of the thesis is to show how powerful city-regional narratives are materal-ised. To achieve this aim the research considers three key theoretical, methodological and empirical issues.  In terms of theory, the research considers the role played by processes of narrative construction and institutionalisation in mediating the development of city-region agendas and subsequent material change.  Methodologically, it asks how research can be designed to understand the relationship between these processes.  Empirically, the research looks to increase our knowledge and understanding of these processes and events within South East Wales.\r\n\r\nSouth East Wales was identified as a fertile geographic location for research attention in light of the significant progression of a city-regional debate and the unique social, historical, institutional, and economic characteristics of the area.  The research covers a period between 1992 and 2008 and explores the changing geographies of state spatiality and region-building processes operating in and around the case study area.  \r\n\r\nThe research approach draws on literature from several disciplines including human geography, political economy, international relations, and urban and regional planning.  A three-stage analytical framework was developed to focus attention on particular elements of city-regionalism: i) the narrative construction of the city-region by key stakeholders; ii) institutionalisation of the narratives; and iii) materialisation of the city-region concept.  Evidence was generated through the use of semi-structured interviews, documentary analysis and participant observation.  The results indicate that greater attention should be given to the specific contexts in which city-regional agendas are promoted, including the roles played by personal relationships and the socio-economic conditions in the hinterland. The results also highlight the role played by the politics of scale as part of city-regional contestation and the tangible links which exist between discursive processes and the materialisation of city-regions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allan, James"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85586,"sim:weight":0.354192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222951,"sim:weight":0.351201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.327714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109122,"sim:weight":0.294523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.275838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.275838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.271696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631934,"sim:weight":0.268648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84852,"sim:weight":0.254721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71910,"sim:weight":0.242484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222840,"sim:weight":0.237425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.235292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85489,"sim:weight":0.230998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.230972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643996,"sim:weight":0.229813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222808,"sim:weight":0.22625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631763,"sim:weight":0.223729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76022,"sim:weight":0.222207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.222074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.215608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2821432,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"A novel protocol for the quantification of temporal and postural gait parameters of rats and humans","bibo:abstract":"Animal models have been used for many years to generalise the human condition of various neurological diseases. It is important that the behavioural attributes from the animal model directly correlate with those found in the human pathology. Motion analysis (MA) techniques provide a platform for direct correlation analysis between the two species, which is an important step for translational medicine.\r\nA novel three dimensional (3D) MA protocol was developed to investigate temporal and postural gait variables in both rats and humans. Gait studies involving rats are mainly based on movement scores or descriptive approaches to discerning differences in behaviour or function. Therefore, a protocol utilising a quantitative 3DMA technique during gait was developed. Data was acquired to describe function and behavioural attributes in animal models of Parkinson‟s disease (PD) and stroke in terms of temporal gait and postural adjustments and on a healthy cohort of humans.\r\nThe study explored the practicality of the developed protocol to investigate the effects of unilateral dopamine depletion on rat locomotion while walking on beams of varying widths (wide, narrow and graduated). Temporal and postural gait parameters of ten male Lister Hooded rats (five controls (CNL) and five hemi-parkinsonian (PNL)) were observed using passive markers placed in locations that were representative of their four limbs and their body axis. Significant differences (p\u003c0.05) were found between the PNL and CNL rats for speed along the wide beam and stride lengths for the left (impaired) fore-limb; on the narrow beam and the wide beam and for the left (impaired) hind limb on the graduated beam. The PD rats moved on the wide beam with a significantly greater roll range of motion (ROM) coupled with a positively biased roll kinematic waveform during one gait cycle. Whilst walking on the narrow beam, they displayed an increased use of the ledge and placed their tail towards the right. The results demonstrate that marker-based MA can provide an effective and simple approach to quantifying temporal gait parameters for rat models of PD. They also reveal how the width of the path affects the locomotion in both experimental cohorts.\r\nii\r\nThe novel protocol was applied to investigate the effects of Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) and graft on rat locomotion while walking on a wide beam. The data collection was carried out before and after surgery to investigate temporal and postural gait parameters of 50 male Wister rats. Significant differences (p\u003c0.05) were found between the control and MCAO rats for roll ROM coupled with a positively biased roll kinematic waveform during one gait cycle. Using the data collected, a classification tool based around the Dempster-Shafer theory enabled the objective classification of the rat cohorts into a MCAO group, a control group and a graft group. The roll ROM and swing time data were transformed into a set of belief values that the animals had graft, lesion or normal gait. The belief values were then represented on a simplex plot, which enables the final classification of a rat, and the level of benefit achieved by lesion or graft surgery to be visualised. The tool was able to classify rats with an accuracy of between 81% and 94.84% accuracy. The tool also indicated that swing time and roll were the most influential variables in distinguishing differences in gait after MCAO lesion and graft. Further work is required on the graft data as some inconsistencies were found, but the classification allowed better comparisons between groups than just using ANOVA alone by taking this level of uncertainty and producing a clear comparison between the cohorts.\r\nInitial studies have demonstrated a practical and visual approach that can discriminate between gait function in the rat model. Therefore to achieve the aim of the thesis, a cohort of healthy humans were tested to replicate the data collection and processing protocols developed for animal MA. The marker based protocol was carried out to investigate temporal and postural gait parameters of 10 healthy human subjects (five male: five female). The data collected compared well with published data for normal human gait therefore validating the human based protocol. The results identified variables that were easily correlated with rat data. Similarities in body orientation patterns were recorded and discussed.\r\nIn conclusion, a novel protocol was developed that allowed a simple, non-invasive, practical, and sensitive approach to over ground gait data acquisition for the rat models and a healthy human cohort. Further work that would involve patients with neurological disease will enable the full validation of the protocol. This is turn would provide answers to the argument: „Is the use of animal models of the disease effective approach for clinical research?‟","bibo:AuthorList":["Madete, June"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75274,"sim:weight":0.33653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75630,"sim:weight":0.333284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.316352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57381,"sim:weight":0.253814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77047,"sim:weight":0.252193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.242638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26442,"sim:weight":0.238372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77770,"sim:weight":0.23499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.222771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.220139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.220022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.220022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.210239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.210239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10910,"sim:weight":0.208641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631609,"sim:weight":0.197867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.19336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.188315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.18111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631989,"sim:weight":0.178944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There are reports of press-fit\r\nacetabular cups experiencing excessive deformation on impaction into the acetabulum which\r\ncould lead to unfavourable conditions for bone in-growth and could adversely affect the\r\nlubrication regime of the bearing. This may have implications for the use of a reduced\r\nmodulus material such as CFR-PEEK. The aim of this project was therefore to investigate\r\nthe level of deformation the prototype Biomet UK Ltd CFR-PEEK cup experiences on\r\nimpaction into the acetabulum and to assess the effect this deformation would have on the\r\ntribological behaviour of the system. In order to achieve this aim three different test regimes\r\nwere considered; rim loading, impaction into polyurethane foam and impaction into cadaveric\r\nbone. In each case, corresponding finite element models were created. To assess the\r\nimpact cup deformation would have on the lubrication regime of the ceramic-on-CFR-PEEK\r\nbearing, friction testing was conducted on cups with various clearances.\r\nThis study has shown that that the polyurethane foam model is the most suitable method for\r\nassessing the level of cup deformation which occurs due to the impaction of a press fit\r\nacetabular cup. Testing using cadaveric specimens revealed a high level of variation in both\r\nthe size of cavity produced by reaming and the level of deformation experienced by the cup.\r\nAs a result cadaveric testing is unlikely to give a reliable worse case result. It was also found\r\nthat rim loading is not a valid method for investigating the deformation on impaction of\r\nacetabular shells. In order to use rim loading, the load equivalent to that experienced on\r\nimpaction would have to be found empirically for each individual cup design and size via\r\nimperial measurement.\r\nThe Biomet CFR-PEEK cup experienced a large diametric deformation on impaction of up to\r\n1.084 mm. However, the large clearance between the head and the acetabular cup meant\r\nthat the deformation of the PEEK cup did not result in jamming of the modular femoral head.\r\nThe friction testing demonstrated that the bearing was insensitive to changes in clearance;\r\ntherefore, provided the initial clearance is sufficient the deformation caused by press-fitting\r\nshould not have an adverse effect on the friction and lubrication of the system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Everitt, Holly"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66364,"sim:weight":0.330427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108322,"sim:weight":0.282794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66739,"sim:weight":0.281063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65293,"sim:weight":0.231468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108653,"sim:weight":0.230127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109115,"sim:weight":0.228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631322,"sim:weight":0.180591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22872,"sim:weight":0.179847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75671,"sim:weight":0.16595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222992,"sim:weight":0.157839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26443,"sim:weight":0.157191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26442,"sim:weight":0.154929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27089,"sim:weight":0.154276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.148826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.143144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76176,"sim:weight":0.142141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61036,"sim:weight":0.142126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222961,"sim:weight":0.141319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26522,"sim:weight":0.140285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24871,"sim:weight":0.1279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this article we use this model to quantify and evaluate the dendritic morphology of retinal ganglion cells. Retinal ganglion cells in Opa1(+/-) mutant mice (n\u003d16) and accompanying age- and sex-matched controls (n\u003d11) (age ranges of \u003c10, 10-15 and \u003e20 months) were labelled DiOlistically with carbocyanine dyes to quantify changes in dendritic tree architecture as a function of age. We observed localized dendritic reduction to sublamina b of the inner plexiform layer without retinal ganglion cell loss, showing dendritic pruning of on- but not off-centre retinal ganglion cells, and this effect was exacerbated with age. The mean dendritic field area was reduced in on-centre retinal ganglion cells of 10- to 15-month-old mice (-24.24%; C(V) \u003d0.68; P\u003c0.05) and \u003e20-month-old mice (-43.22%; C(V) \u003d0.75; P\u003c0.05) compared with age-matched wild-type controls. Similar changes were seen in average total dendritic length in on-centre retinal ganglion cells of 10- to 15-month-old mice (-31.66%; C(V) \u003d0.67; P\u003c0.05) and \u003e20-month-old mice (-49.55%; C(V) \u003d0.63; P\u003c0.05). Sholl analysis showed a marked difference in the dendritic arborization of on-centre retinal ganglion cells in the 10- to 15-month-old group (area under the curve -21.67%; P\u003e0.05) and of the \u003e20-month-old group (area under the curve -42.12%; P\u003c0.05) compared with the control group. There was no detectable change in dendritic morphology in \u003c10-month-old Opa1(+/-) mutant mice compared with wild-type (P\u003e0.05). No significant changes (P\u003e0.05) were seen in off-centre retinal ganglion cells. Finally, there was also no significant change (P\u003e0.05) in the retinal ganglion cell count across all age groups. In conclusion, we show dendritic pruning in on-centre retinal ganglion cells of the Opa1(+/-) mouse model of autosomal dominant optic atrophy from as early as 10 months of age. These results highlight the importance of normal mitochondrial fusion balance, as influenced by the OPA1 protein in maintaining the dendritic morphology of retinal ganglion cells. Dendritic pruning precedes the onset of clinical visual loss and structural changes in the optic nerve in the absence of significant cell loss.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Peter A.","Morgan, James Edwards","Votruba, Marcela"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1093/brain","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.169595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631544,"sim:weight":0.148533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643987,"sim:weight":0.143268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.110257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76620,"sim:weight":0.110223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631955,"sim:weight":0.102733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632063,"sim:weight":0.0975131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77174,"sim:weight":0.0974152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76149,"sim:weight":0.0910176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23818,"sim:weight":0.0674801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Since the mid-20th\r\ncentury ‘landscape’ changes, associated with: i) energy regime shifts from coal to oil and\r\ngas; and ii) globalisation and neo-liberalism have combined to drive the equally rapid deindustrialisation\r\nof the Welsh economy: a process which has left a structural legacy of\r\neconomic and social deprivation across much of the region. In this context devolution and\r\nthe establishment of a Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) with a statutory duty to promote\r\nsustainable development, has presented both unique opportunities and challenges. Despite\r\nlimited powers WAG is determined that Wales will play an internationally leading role in\r\ntackling climate change. Rather than simply acting as a ‘policy taker’, WAG has established\r\nambitious targets which exceed current UK and international commitments: including a 3%\r\nannual reduction in GGE in areas of devolved competence; all new buildings to be zero\r\ncarbon; and to produce as much electricity from renewable sources as is consumed in\r\nWales by 2025. This paper will explore the politics of sustainable regions through the\r\ngovernance of energy and innovation in Wales.

However, the frequency of these syndromal \u0027dominant optic atrophy plus\u0027 variants and the extent of neurological involvement have not been established. In this large multi-centre study of 104 patients from 45 independent families, including 60 new cases, we show that extra-ocular neurological complications are common in OPA1 disease, and affect up to 20% of all mutational carriers. Bilateral sensorineural deafness beginning in late childhood and early adulthood was a prominent manifestation, followed by a combination of ataxia, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy and progressive external ophthalmoplegia from the third decade of life onwards. We also identified novel clinical presentations with spastic paraparesis mimicking hereditary spastic paraplegia, and a multiple sclerosis-like illness. In contrast to initial reports, multi-system neurological disease was associated with all mutational subtypes, although there was an increased risk with missense mutations [odds ratio \u003d 3.06, 95% confidence interval \u003d 1.44-6.49; P \u003d 0.0027], and mutations located within the guanosine triphosphate-ase region (odds ratio \u003d 2.29, 95% confidence interval \u003d 1.08-4.82; P \u003d 0.0271). Histochemical and molecular characterization of skeletal muscle biopsies revealed the presence of cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in the majority of patients harbouring OPA1 mutations, even in those with isolated optic nerve involvement. However, the cytochrome c oxidase-deficient load was over four times higher in the dominant optic atrophy + group compared to the pure optic neuropathy group, implicating a causal role for these secondary mitochondrial DNA defects in disease pathophysiology. Individuals with dominant optic atrophy plus phenotypes also had significantly worse visual outcomes, and careful surveillance is therefore mandatory to optimize the detection and management of neurological disability in a group of patients who already have significant visual impairment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yu-Wai-Man, P.","Griffiths, P.

Intriguingly, various mutations in the OPA3 gene lead to two similar diseases in humans: autosomal dominant inherited optic atrophy and cataract (ADOAC) and a metabolic condition; type 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (MGA). Early onset bilateral optic atrophy is a common characteristic of both disorders; retinal ganglion cells are lost and visual acuity is impaired from an early age. In order to investigate the function of the OPA3 protein, we have generated a novel ENU-induced mutant mouse carrying a missense mutation in the OPA3 gene. The heterozygous mutation in exon 2, causes an amino acid change p.L122P (c.365T\u003eC), which is predicted to alter tertiary protein structure. In the heterozygous state, the mice appear uncompromised however; in the homozygous state mice display some of the features of MGA. Visual function is severely reduced, consistent with significant loss of retinal ganglion cells and degeneration of axons in the optic nerve. In the homozygous optic nerve, there was evidence of increased mitochondrial activity, as demonstrated by the increased presence of mitochondrial marker Cytochrome C Oxidase (COX) histochemistry. Mice homozygous for the opa3L122P mutation also display a severe multi-systemic disease characterized by reduced lifespan (majority dying before 4 months), decreased weight, dilated cardiomyopathy, extrapyramidal dysfunction and gross neuro-muscular defects. All of these defects are synonymous with the phenotypic characteristics of Type III MGA found in humans. This model will be of major importance for future studies of the specific function of the OPA3 gene.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Vanessa J.","Powell, Kate A.","White, Kathryn E.","Yip, Wan Fen","Hogan, Vanessa","Hollins, Andrew John","Davies, Jennifer Rhian","Piechota, Malgorzata","Brownstein, David G.","Moat, Stuart James","Nichols, Philip P.","Wride, Michael A.","Boulton, Michael Edwin","Votruba, Marcela"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1093/brain","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.241035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75436,"sim:weight":0.235113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632025,"sim:weight":0.216424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23935,"sim:weight":0.183051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.170319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.169371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80806,"sim:weight":0.166952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108070,"sim:weight":0.166794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76066,"sim:weight":0.152223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10907,"sim:weight":0.150318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.150099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26783,"sim:weight":0.141775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23818,"sim:weight":0.140973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76149,"sim:weight":0.133985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632063,"sim:weight":0.131394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76719,"sim:weight":0.121474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.117991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I show that moral outrage and feelings of empathy with a disadvantaged group play an important role in predicting solidarity-based collective action tendencies, while sympathy seems to be an unreliable predictor. I also provide evidence that the perceived efficacy of collective action at consolidating the identity of the protesting movement can influence collective action tendencies directly but also indirectly by feeding into perceptions of the action’s political efficacy.\r\nIn Studies 4-7, I examine whether the pursuit of violent forms of collective action is subject to considerations regarding the efficacy of both violent and nonviolent forms of action, and the interaction between these two. I show that violence support and violent action tendencies are generally positively predicted by violence efficacy but not consistently negatively predicted by nonviolence efficacy, as nonviolence efficacy and violence efficacy appear to interact in some contexts (Studies 4-6). Importantly, my studies reveal that people are more supportive of violent action the more efficacious it seems, even if nonviolent action is also a promising strategy. Further, when violent action seems to have low efficacy, people may still support its pursuit if they deem nonviolence to have low efficacy as well.\r\nOverall, the findings of this thesis contribute to current scholarly efforts at identifying novel predictors of collective action as well as predictors of different forms of collective action.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saab, Rim"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.197557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5505366,"sim:weight":0.197332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.160936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.143668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.143668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.142561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85183,"sim:weight":0.134562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76578,"sim:weight":0.126151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24651,"sim:weight":0.121181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631699,"sim:weight":0.1203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57364,"sim:weight":0.117394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.115275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76564,"sim:weight":0.11317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.112235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, in the area of national reform towards this future shift in all sectors becoming more environmentally aware, schools and education are pivotal. There is political focus on carbon reduction as it is more easily measured than social developments; however, sustainable design seeks to improve the well-being of our communities and the individuals that live within them as well as global problem of climate change. The aim of this research was to interpret a design solution to satisfy the existing debate surrounding the future of primary school design in Wales. This research has investigated how the architecture of schools can respond to the needs of a community, its culture and social issues as well as the education of its pupils. \r\n\r\nThis research outlines the elements that encompass ‘good school design’ and the philosophical drivers behind developments of the school plan. It includes a summary of the current political and cultural aspirations towards school buildings and education in Wales and considers how the built environment can influence a child’s cognitive development. Through literature review, site investigations and critical analysis of four established successful primary schools in South Wales, a series of design proposals are developed for Williamstown primary school in the Rhondda Valley. It is the author’s intention to display an ‘idealistic’ design proposal of a primary school that highlights the possible influence that architectural design of schools can have over the social habits and culture of its users. The design is a series of concepts developed in parallel with the research, used to interrogate the potential of bespoke school design. \r\n\r\nThe authors design for Williamstown challenges what a school can be. Nestling the buildings within the landscape and sprawling the physical morphology changes the very nature of the school as a single institution. The school can act as a cultural centre with the children themselves actively promoting a social change towards a rejuvenated sustainable community. The research suggests the favoured places within a school are those that have involved the users and are more cherished for their unique nature. Bespoke design is informed through consultation with the community, it is not a school given to them, but created with them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roach, Gareth"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.452128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74643,"sim:weight":0.440474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55249,"sim:weight":0.392585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76945,"sim:weight":0.36665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.365948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.311383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67390,"sim:weight":0.307161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.295957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.295957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.247387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Dynamic formation of SERS hot spots","bibo:abstract":"We report a systematic study of the surface modification of gold and silver nanoparticles with dl-penicillamine (PEN) and N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (NAP), motivated by the possibility of inducing pH-controlled reversible nanoparticle assembly. The interaction of PEN and NAP with the metal nanoparticle surface was studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The results indicate that equilibrium is reached with the formation of a submonolayer corresponding to ca. 40% and 64% of total surface coverage for PEN and NAP, respectively. Both PEN and NAP modified nanoparticles could be reversibly aggregated at acidic pH due to the protonation of the carboxylic groups, leading to a decrease in their stability by electrostatic interactions and the advent of hydrogen bonding interactions which promote interparticle linkage. The process was monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. Interestingly, the SERS characterization demonstrated the pH-controlled formation of hot-spots.","bibo:AuthorList":["Taladriz Blanco, Patricia","Buurma, Niklaas Jan","Rodriguez Lorenzo, Laura","Perez Juste, Jorge","Liz Marzan, Luis","Herves, Pablo"],"dc:date":"2011-07-29","doi":"10.1039/C1JM12175H","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5844604,"sim:weight":0.313707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567251,"sim:weight":0.267843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.251666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1566216,"sim:weight":0.245519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844976,"sim:weight":0.242378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1562783,"sim:weight":0.238651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11438,"sim:weight":0.23294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1566223,"sim:weight":0.215811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76938,"sim:weight":0.20864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848306,"sim:weight":0.191907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76556,"sim:weight":0.185081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1564008,"sim:weight":0.180785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1564007,"sim:weight":0.179319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105106,"sim:weight":0.179289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631579,"sim:weight":0.17884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11887,"sim:weight":0.177664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75677,"sim:weight":0.170122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631556,"sim:weight":0.162405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631911,"sim:weight":0.157903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77276,"sim:weight":0.135764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Second, this work is an exploration of ethical techniques. The goal of the dissertation is to discover an ethos that takes into\r\naccount the best contemporary critical attitudes and techniques of ethical selfconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first chapter begins with a discussion of the development of Foucault’s archaeological method. Discussion of some problems with structuralism, his genealogical method, and finally his movement towards an ethical program follows. The method for the dissertation will be exploratory and critical.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter develops a line of thinking about the development of freedom in Kant and Foucault. Power relations are a persistent context in which selfconstruction takes place. Resistance to power relations marks the beginning of freedom, which requires testing and moving beyond the limits of socially constructed\r\nselves. The Quakers display a model of structured resistance to enclosing authorities. John Woolman provides an example of ethical self-construction.\r\n\r\nThe third chapter explores Foucault’s ethical project by examining ancient Greco-Roman and Christian technologies of the self, and relates those projects to ethical self-construction through writing. This exploration shows continuity in the product of writing from Ancient through modern writers.\r\n\r\nThe fourth chapter develops a postmodern ethos through an examination of weak ontology. James Rachels’ ethical programme is a model for a postmodern technology of the self. The resulting technique offered provides a vulnerability to facticity while retaining the best ethical principles and critical reasoning. This is illustrated in Miroslav Volf’s The End of Memory.\r\n\r\nFoucault’s ethos is a clear precursor to modern technologies of the self that\r\ntake the exploration of knowledge with humility into account.","bibo:AuthorList":["Olena, Douglas"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108286,"sim:weight":0.268286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77218,"sim:weight":0.24999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.234474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75340,"sim:weight":0.216804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108330,"sim:weight":0.209786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223937,"sim:weight":0.201359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109107,"sim:weight":0.199856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631105,"sim:weight":0.19505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.183774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.183774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25067,"sim:weight":0.176765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57364,"sim:weight":0.176529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108175,"sim:weight":0.176163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.171414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

By way of balance, I suggest that there may be a sense in which necessary conditions of discourse transcend the distinction between a priori and empirical.\r\n\r\nIn chapter two I reject the claim that logical relations in the form of intrinsic probability enter into the no-miracles argument, which I suggest is frequency-connected in its more systematic applications, so that it belongs within a system.\r\n\r\nI begin chapter three with a critique of an attempted formal probability solution to Hume’s problem, and I now suggest that inductive inference has application only within a system in which its validity is pre-supposed in its premises, a concomitant of which is that the sceptic\r\nabout induction cannot stop short of global scepticism.\r\nSince my aim is to show that global scepticism is self-refuting, given that intentionality may be analysed in terms of a system, I now develop that analysis by devoting chapter four to an examination of Wittgenstein on meaning and understanding.\r\n\r\nIn chapter five I reject his thesis equating meaning and understanding with use, arguing instead that they are irreducible and subject to dispositionality conditions, and in furtherance of that argument I try to solve the problem of the authoritativeness of belief avowals by showing again that there are necessary conditions of discourse. These are such that selfascribing belief, crediting oneself with understanding and with being suitably disposed, are\r\ninherent in reasoning.\r\n\r\nIn chapter six I weave the threads of the previous discussion into a solution by arguing that the sceptic about induction, who is committed to global scepticism, necessarily refutes himself.\r\n\r\nIn chapter seven, on the problem of other minds, I attempt a solution by modifying the arguments used against inductive scepticism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Peddle, Laurence"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86312,"sim:weight":0.316724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77086,"sim:weight":0.313063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108091,"sim:weight":0.301776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734385,"sim:weight":0.299982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85726,"sim:weight":0.299702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85083,"sim:weight":0.287498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109063,"sim:weight":0.286988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108071,"sim:weight":0.281864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108174,"sim:weight":0.275023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.27416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85872,"sim:weight":0.257622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108318,"sim:weight":0.252909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108414,"sim:weight":0.244724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108265,"sim:weight":0.230151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77162,"sim:weight":0.22266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study included the physical model with steady inflow and unsteady\r\ninflow in the lab, and numerical model to simulate the development process, considering the\r\nbank erosion and secondary flow.\r\nIn the study of channel development with physical model, a series of tests have been carried\r\nout to model the fluvial river with different flume slope, flow rate and channel section size.\r\nThe meandering thawleg channel development process was carefully observed and from\r\nresults in the lab, channels only had curved boundaries with meandering thalweg, not the real\r\nmeandering river. Many characteristics of fluvial river in the nature like ripple- pool unit,\r\npoint bar have been modelled successfully. Then different parameters like slope, flow rate\r\nand channel size were tested independently to see their effect on channel morphology. From\r\nexperiments, it is confirmed that slope is key factor to distinguish straight, meandering and\r\nbraided channels. Flow rate and section size were also discussed. From the discussion of\r\ndifferent controlling parameters, it is found that the essential control factor is Froude number.\r\nTests with unsteady inflow were then carried out to model the real hydrology process as that\r\nin nature. Gradually varied unsteady inflow and rapidly varied unsteady inflow were\r\nachieved by controlling the frequency of pump. Bed profile of channel after operation was\r\nrecorded by Bed Profiler.

Public perception research has consistently shown widespread support for renewable energy and specific technologies (e.g. wind and solar especially); yet at the local level developments often face a lot of opposition (McGowen \u0026 Sauter, 2005). Much research has focused on explaining responses at the local level, however little research has examined the often assumed widespread support. Through a mixed-method approach (using both qualitative and more innovative quantitative methods including a decision-pathway approach; Gregory et al., 1997) this research is able to show that there are many nuances and complexities evident in general attitudes and perceptions, which are normally missed when using traditional survey methods. Support for renewables, and wind farms in particular, is to some extent unstable, undefined and qualified, yet this is not often acknowledged in the literature or in practice. The role for more complex attitudes, uncertainty and low-salience is highlighted. The results are discussed in relation to the literature examining local responses, and implications for policy and practice are drawn out. What it means to measure public opinion is discussed.

Advancements in technology offer robots the potential to be used extensively in first aid to replace human workers. Currently, many elderly people live alone and absence of care can increase risks of illness- or injury-induced unconsciousness. Due to this, it would be useful to investigate if robots could be employed to perform first-aid care. However, their application in aiding humans in such circumstances is still relatively rare due to complexities concerning safety, communication and ability to interact with humans. This thesis is part of a project to design a first-aid robot to manipulate an unconscious human from any position to the recovery position. The only direct contact with human is through gripper of the robot. An attempt to develop a conceptual design of cost-effective grippers has been undertaken. This will enable a robot to perform the handling and manipulation of human segments to achieve the recovery position. For the purpose of robotic application, a research into the feasibility of human body manipulation is being conducted. Initial stage of research is to identify the limit of physical robot-human interaction; the biomechanical characteristics of human body that decide these limits and essential gripper specifications required to theoretically carry out robot-human interactions to those limits. The research is focused on the geometric properties of various human body parts, defined as body segments, and the minimum gripper specification needed to manipulate these segments.\r\nA novel systematic design approach has been applied to the gripper by utilizing a design tool known as the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ). Results\r\nii\r\nobtained from this study have substantiated design work to derive an enhanced design solution, which will enable the gripper to perform delicate tasks. The gripper‟s main priorities have been identified and concluded that fundamental issues are: safely engaging human segments and preventing pain exceeding the recommended pain threshold. This work could form the basis of developing and integrating the First Aid Robotic System (FAROS) and pave a way for further developments and innovations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saw, Min"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109329,"sim:weight":0.415285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.247452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.232014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.214068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567333,"sim:weight":0.200804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.189115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.178578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.178578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.173447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632061,"sim:weight":0.163405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Differential adhesion to fibronectin facilitated the isolation of clonally derived stem cell populations (clone x), a cell population representing the whole lamina propria, analogous to OMF (LO), and cells which do not adhere to fibronectin within the context of the differential adhesion assay (NA).\r\nPopulation doublings indicated that all cell populations were capable of exceeding the growth potential of BMSCs, however populations demonstrated distinct growth characteristics during the early phase of growth.

Engineering materials such as glass, metals and\r\nceramics can be machined without requiring expensive special tools and without any\r\nlimitations on the 3D complexity of the component.\r\nLaser milling is still in its infancy. Laser material interactions are not yet fully understood.\r\nMuch effort in research and development of the available laser sources is still needed.\r\nUltrafast lasers are beginning to be applied. They can offer more precise machining without\r\nthe thermal damage that accompanies long-pulse laser manufacturing.\r\nLaser pulse duration and its effect on resulting surface integrity has been studied as well as\r\nmaterial removal strategy and process accuracy.\r\nIn order to characterise the resulting surface after laser ablation, the heat affected zone is\r\nusually specified. In most cases, visual inspection would be performed without further\r\nanalysis, resulting in variance of the findings attributed to the operator.\r\nA new methodology was required to accurately and impartially assess the heat penetration and\r\nquantify the findings. Based on material grain refinement, a comprehensive new methodology\r\nwas created. By monitoring the changes in grain sizes, a chart of the heat penetration could\r\nbe created accurately with automated routines.\r\nSurface integrity is a critical factor for many applications and a methodology based on\r\nanalysis of grain refinement in the vicinity of the processed area would create a full map of\r\n- iii -\r\nthe changes happening after laser ablation. Furthermore, the impact of the laser pulse duration\r\nis studied utilising the above mentioned development. Further to the surface roughness and\r\nheat affected zone, an in-depth analysis was completed on the micro hardness of the material\r\nin order to create a comprehensive chart of the changes induced by the laser milling process.\r\nMaterial removal is based on the overlapping of single craters, and the way the craters overlap\r\nis referred to as material removal strategy. Generally there are many strategies formulated for\r\nmaterial removal but none of them takes into account the specifics of laser milling. Based on\r\nsurface orientation, dimensions and feature importance, an assessment of material removal\r\nstrategies is presented. Although ‘laser milling’ is a term used for a number of material\r\nremoval processes, there are significant differences between them. New strategies for material\r\nremoval are formulated and reported based on surface topography and orientation. Advanced\r\nprogramming is realised using a commercially available generic CAM package but taking into\r\naccount the specifics of the laser milling process.\r\nThe accuracy of the laser milling process depends on the laser-material interaction, and also\r\non the machine hardware, control system and software. Most of the factors affecting accuracy\r\ncannot be changed once the machine is built, but there are some that can be optimised to\r\nimprove process accuracy. The laser source with its characteristics is as important as the\r\nmaterial being processed. The relationship between pulse duration, pulse shape and accuracy\r\nof the process was demonstrated through a series of experiments designed to expose the\r\ncorrelation between, and impact of, these parameters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petkov, Petko"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77070,"sim:weight":0.392528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795333,"sim:weight":0.313671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76320,"sim:weight":0.311456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.274629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222922,"sim:weight":0.238814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108622,"sim:weight":0.23116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108314,"sim:weight":0.22788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24911,"sim:weight":0.227861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.220519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84285,"sim:weight":0.2113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821123,"sim:weight":0.177296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.172554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.169472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.167977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Representing around 85% of corneal thickness, the stroma possesses the mechanical strength needed to protect intraocular tissues, whilst still achieving the high level of transparency necessary for light transmission. This is chiefly due to the small, uniform diameter collagen fibrils arranged into a precisely ordered series of orthogonal lamellae. Proteoglycans in the stroma are thought to regulate the arrangement and diameter of the collagen fibrils, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood. \r\n\r\nThe deceptively complex organisation of the stroma may be responsible for the relatively little progress that has been made in engineering constructs that can reproduce the structural and functional characteristics of the cornea. Further study into the embryonic development of the cornea may aid attempts to recapitulate in vivo mechanisms for corneal construction. Of particular relevance would be the method of collagen organisation and deposition in the developing avian corneal stroma and the interactions that occur within the collagen fibril bundles as development progresses.\r\n\r\nInitially, en face sections were used to study the organisation and arrangement of collagen fibrils in the developing stroma. It is hypothesized that in tendon, the formation of parallel arrays of collagen fibrils occurs via fibroblast surface recesses and invaginations. It was evident through transmission electron microscopy that this process also occurs in the developing corneal stroma via surface recesses on stromal keratocytes.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the interactions between the collagen and proteoglycans within fibril bundles demonstrated that the developing cornea is less well structured than often considered and is possibly a much more fluid and dynamic system than originally thought. Proteoglycan size and orientation show a degree of variety and disorder and appear to follow no set organisation or positioning. The data suggests that proteoglycans were seen forming aggregates that were capable of bridging the gap between more distant neighbouring fibrils.\r\n\r\nFollowing the study of the developing corneal stroma, collagen gel based constructs were engineered and their structural and functional characteristics were analysed to assess their potential as stromal equivalents for use in tissue engineering. Manipulating the assembly of collagen fibrils by varying the pH and cross-linker concentration had a dramatic effect on the structure and functionality of the final gel construct. A range of collagen gels were then implanted into intra-stromal pockets to determine their biocompatibility and in vivo properties.","bibo:AuthorList":["Duncan, Thomas"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Groundwater then becomes a very important resource to meet the economical and agricultural demand in the northern coastal areas. Groundwater has been over-exploited and some problems occurred such as saline deterioration and aquifer deterioration since 1960s. To better understand these problems for a proper management solution, this project was setup for groundwater investigations aiming better management strategy in Wadi Baye as a case study based upon the governmental water management requirement.\r\nBased on systematic literature review and data collection on geology, hydrogeology and other related environmental aspects, the groundwater systems were studied in terms of recharge and discharge, boundary and recharge and hydraulic characteristics using field based, hydrochemical/isotopic analysis and numerical modelling approaches. A series of techniques were employed to study the spatial and temporal variations of the groundwater flow field and hydrochemistry in the shallow and deep aquifer systems. The isotope signature was also used to understand the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in Wadi Baye. It is found that the shallow groundwater is mainly influenced by the palaeo-saline hydro-environment, the deep groundwater geochemistry is impacted by mixture with the modern water around 50 km off the coastal line.\r\nA 3D groundwater numerical model was built using ModFlow based on proper calculation and calibration of the major hydraulic parameters. Calculation of groundwater budgets shows that total annual averaged recharge is 167K m3/d in Wadi Baye; the exploitable resources for shallow and deep aquifers are 33.7K and 15.6K m3/d respectively. Groundwater exploitation potential indicates that both shallow and deep groundwater systems are under over-exploitation. Sensitivity analysis of hydraulic conductivity, specific yield (storitivity) and precipitation recharge shows that hydraulic conductivity poses the greatest impact to the model in Wadi Baye.\r\nThree groundwater utilisation plans were proposed for further prediction in the future 10 years using the calibrated groundwater model. Modelling scenarios show that shallow and deep groundwater field will draw down under existing and increasing abstraction plans; drawdown in shallow groundwater will be greatly reduced if abstraction reduces to exploitable level and the overall flow field can remain stable or recover. However water level around the concentrated abstraction area will still drop down due to the localised negative balance by pumping. The best management strategy was proposed based on the modelling scenarios, to achieve a sustainable water management for the Wadi Baye area.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohamed Basher, Hoosein"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":706510,"sim:weight":0.50564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52366,"sim:weight":0.458275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97743,"sim:weight":0.31545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631597,"sim:weight":0.297079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108396,"sim:weight":0.282303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24710,"sim:weight":0.277299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58709,"sim:weight":0.272162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85639,"sim:weight":0.27053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53448,"sim:weight":0.261696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386722,"sim:weight":0.234524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386717,"sim:weight":0.216898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51844,"sim:weight":0.189339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For the majority of genes both alleles are transcribed (or expressed) equally. However, for a small subset of genes, known as imprinted genes, only one allele is expressed in a parent-of-origin dependent manner (note that the ‘imprint’ here refers to the epigenetic mechanism through which one allele is silenced, and is completely unrelated to classical ‘filial imprinting’ manifest at the behavioural level). Thus, for some imprinted genes expression is only (or predominantly) seen from the paternally inherited allele, whilst for the remainder, expression is only observed from the maternally inherited allele. Early work on this class of genes highlighted their importance in gross developmental and growth phenotypes. Recent studies in mouse models and humans have emphasised their contribution to brain function and behaviour. In this article, we review the literature concerning the expression of imprinted genes in the brain. In particular, we attempt to define emerging organisation themes, especially in terms of the direction of imprinting (i.e. maternal or paternal expression). We also emphasise the likely role of imprinted genes in neurodevelopment. We end by pointing out that, so far as discerning the precise functions of imprinted genes in the brain is concerned, there are currently more questions than answers; ranging from the extent to which imprinted genes might contribute to common mental disorders, to wider issues related to how easily the new data on brain may be accommodated within the dominant theory regarding the origins and maintenance of imprinting, which pits the maternal and paternal genomes against each other in an evolutionary battle of the sexes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, William","Isles, Anthony Roger","Wilkinson, Lawrence Stephen"],"dc:date":"2005-05","doi":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.11.007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631862,"sim:weight":0.254857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85444,"sim:weight":0.236796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631548,"sim:weight":0.22684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108282,"sim:weight":0.218184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930163,"sim:weight":0.209377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733696,"sim:weight":0.208935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77652,"sim:weight":0.206618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75595,"sim:weight":0.189111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77375,"sim:weight":0.178144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.173903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.168826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.168826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26719,"sim:weight":0.16426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87201,"sim:weight":0.160891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.160804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316095,"sim:weight":0.155715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.152867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5873,"sim:weight":0.148104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.147759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108980,"sim:weight":0.138824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Most established\r\ndesign methodologies are of the prescriptive type and they are based on step-oriented\r\nmodels.\r\nHowever, designers in industry are not found to be too keen on using any of these\r\ndesign methodologies. Among the reasons for not adopting these methodologies are that the\r\nprescriptive and normative design methodologies were found to be influencing the design\r\nstrategies and approaches of a designer while the descriptive types were mostly used to\r\nstudy the design process. Though designers have their own design strategies and\r\napproaches, they also need design support.

The\r\ngoal of this research is to derive a design methodology framework to support designers\r\nwithout influencing their design approaches and strategies.\r\nA descriptive design methodology framework to support designers is proposed in\r\nthis research work. This framework was derived based on four aspects: a descriptive type\r\nbased on a function-oriented model, the types of support facilities that can be provided,\r\nidentification of critical design factors as design parameters for the framework and lastly,\r\nthe adaptation of the Ishikawa fishbone diagram to represent the framework.\r\nThe novel descriptive design methodology was applied in two case studies: the first\r\nwith an experienced designer without using any design methods and second, with a novice\r\ndesigner adopting a design approach based on the step-oriented model. The second case\r\nstudy included an additional design tool based on TRIZ to verify the effectiveness of the\r\nnovel descriptive design methodology working with other tools. The designers’ feedback\r\nand observations from these both case studies showed that the novel descriptive design\r\nmethodology was able to support designers in many ways. In particular it was able to\r\naccommodate different design approaches and strategies without influencing the designer,\r\nproviding both methodology-related and computational-platform related support facilities as\r\nwell as working in a complementary way with other design tools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ng, Kok"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Detailed analysis of 100 case files selected from a single coroner\u0027s office in the UK reveals that patterns of suicide can be seen to map on to conventional features of a socially structured life course, with young people in crisis, mid-life gendered patterns of work and family and older people in decline.

Optimization of activity requires an understanding of their interaction with microbial targets and a clear differentiation between the chemical efficacies of each oxidative biocide. This study aimed to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of action of oxidizing biocides at a macromolecular level, using amino acids, protein and an enzyme as model substrates for the action of each biocide.\r\n\r\nMethods The interactions of a number of oxidising agents (liquid and gaseous H2O2, ClO2, peracetic acid formulations) with amino acids, proteins (bovine serum albumin and aldolase) and enzymes were investigated by spectrophotometry, SDS-PAGE and alkaline phosphatase activity measurements.\r\n\r\nResults Biocide reactions yielded different types of oxidative structural change and different degrees of oxidation to amino acids and proteins, and differences in activity against a microbial enzyme. In particular there was a marked difference in the interactions of liquid H2O2 and gaseous H2O2 with the macromolecules, the latter causing greater oxidation; these results explain the dramatic differences in antimicrobial efficacy between liquid and gas peroxide.\r\n\r\nConclusions These results provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in interactions between a number of oxidizing agents and macromolecules commonly found in microbial cells. Biochemical mechanistic differences between these oxidative biocides do exist and lead to differential effects on macromolecules. This in turn could provide an explanation as to their differences in biocidal activity, particularly between liquid and gas peroxide.","bibo:AuthorList":["Finnegan, Michelle","Linley, Ezra","Denyer, Stephen Paul","McDonnell, G.","Simons, Claire","Maillard, Jean-Yves"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1093/jac","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75333,"sim:weight":0.225622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108070,"sim:weight":0.161317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.150983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631669,"sim:weight":0.13321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.131606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.127366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.125921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24401,"sim:weight":0.124456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222850,"sim:weight":0.124126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.119302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77267,"sim:weight":0.118811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795349,"sim:weight":0.114774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75818,"sim:weight":0.109395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76743,"sim:weight":0.105238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here, we investigate how these patterns transform dramatically under external stimuli in simple periodic cellular structures that include a nanotube bundle and a millimeter-size plastic straw bundle. Under gradual hydrostatic straining up to 20%, the cross-section of the single walled carbon nanotube bundle undergoes several pattern transformations, while an amazing new hexagram pattern is triggered from the circular shape when the strain of 20% is applied suddenly in one step. Similar to the nanotube bundle, the circular plastic straw bundle is transformed into a hexagonal pattern on heating by conduction through a baseplate but into a hexagram pattern when heated by convection. Besides the well-known elastic buckling, we find other mechanisms of pattern transformation at different scales; these include the minimization of the surface energy at the macroscale or of the van der Waals energy at the nanoscale and the competition between the elastic energy of deformation and either the surface energy at the macroscale or the van der Waals energy at the nanoscale. The studies of the pattern transformations of periodic porous materials offer new insights into the fabrication of novel materials and devices with tailored properties.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhang, Kai","Zhao, X.

Lower limb stability is pivotal to successful dynamic sporting movements, with poor stability during single leg tasks commonly associated with lower limb non-contact injuries. \r\n\r\nObjective. This study investigated stance leg frontal plane stability during a lateral bound task. \r\n\r\nDesign. Players performed an infield clinical screening involving 10 alternating bounds from their left (LLEG) and right (RLEG) legs. Each bound comprised stabilisation (landing) and propulsion (lateral push off). 3D kinematic data for the stance leg (200 Hz) were captured using an automated system (CODAmotionTM) and a cluster marker set. \r\n\r\nSetting. Professional footballers currently performing in the English Football League System performed the screening. \r\n\r\nParticipants. Five participants performed the screening. \r\n\r\nIntervention/Assessment of risk factors. The independent variables in this study were the players involved. \r\n\r\nMain outcome measurements. Absolute frontal plane sway (AFP-Sway) at the hip, knee and ankle were determined (Visual3DTM) and combined to provide a collective stance leg sway score (CSL-Sway) for each trial. Additionally, percentage contributions of AFP-Sway at each joint to CSL-Sway for all trials were determined and compared across players in each condition using one-way ANOVA. \r\n\r\nResults. There were CSL-Sway differences between players within each condition, accounted for by additional motions at all three lower limb joints under LLEG conditions and only hip and knee joints under RLEG conditions. Percentage individual joint contributions to CSL-Sway differed between players at the knee and ankle joints under LLEG and all joints under RLEG conditions. Both conditions revealed two distinct bounding strategies with hip or combination of hip and ankle motions contributing the most to CSL-Sway. \r\n\r\nConclusions. Player differences in CSL-Sway, AFP-Sway and percentage joint contribution to CSL-Sway under both bounding conditions highlight the individualised nature of lateral bound strategies. Such objective assessment of stance leg stability may enable movement stability classification and ultimately aid injury risk identification.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, P.","Kerwin, D.","Irwin, G.","Nokes, Leonard Derek Martin"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1136/bjsm.2011.084038.126","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.171715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.161273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1441838,"sim:weight":0.158284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77770,"sim:weight":0.151674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57381,"sim:weight":0.144421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26442,"sim:weight":0.14255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.127067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77047,"sim:weight":0.125862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631535,"sim:weight":0.114407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1915095,"sim:weight":0.113346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.109073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.108113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75274,"sim:weight":0.106879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631876,"sim:weight":0.10686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75630,"sim:weight":0.105332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.105152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.100559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631989,"sim:weight":0.0952166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.0950034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26590,"sim:weight":0.0779667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study is motivated by the fact that only a limited assessment of driver safety is required for this competition. The approach was to model a Formula Student car in a mathematical dynamic model environment. A parametric study was then carried out to investigate the sensitivity of injury to various system variables. These were the crash pulse, the occupant stature, and the occupant posture. These system variables, under close examination, can be changed to alter the occupant kinematics or, in other words, they change the injury risk. The results of the analysis showed that the risk of injury in a frontal impact was dependent on the system variables. The risk of an abbreviated injury scale (AIS)2 + injury was 22.3 per cent in the baseline constant-g test, increasing to 35.2 per cent in the worst case. For AIS3 + the values were 5.1 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. The study also showed that the occupant restraint conditions in a Formula Student car had a significant influence on the distribution of the injury risk between the body regions. The variation in the injury risk highlighted by this study, both in absolute terms and in the distribution between the body regions, showed that there are limitations to the use of vehicle kinematics in their current guise as a predictive tool for the injury risk. The results of this study represent a significant step in the understanding of the injury risk in a Formula Student frontal impact.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Huw","Gugliotta, B."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1177/0954407011414981","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.191755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26442,"sim:weight":0.176927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25817,"sim:weight":0.168337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.164174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75780,"sim:weight":0.161549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56591,"sim:weight":0.125734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Micro injection moulding is one of the key technologies for cost affective serial production of micro components. In this thesis, the process capabilities and constraints of this technology were studied systematically. More specifically, new tool making process chains and various process factors affecting the micro injection moulding process were investigated. The manufacturing capabilities of this technology were further analysed by investigating the filling behaviour of micro cavities, the influence of air in micro cavities and the forces occurring during the demoulding stage. \r\nChapter 2 of this thesis reviews the slate of the art in micro tooling and micro injection moulding. \r\nIn Chapter 3 an advanced condition monitoring system was developed to better understand the behaviour of the injection moulding process. In particular, cavity pressure sensors were utilised to analyse interdependences between process conditions and key characteristics of cavity pressure curves. \r\nChapter 4 investigates the influence and effects of air inside micro cavities. A design of experiments’ study was carried out to identify process settings for achieving an optimum filling of micro cavities In particular the flow length inside the cavity was investigated to judge about the process performance. \r\nNext, the demoulding stage of the injection moulding cycle was studied in Chapter 5. In particular, ejection forces were analysed to investigate the influence of different  process settings on demoulding behaviour of polymer parts. This is especially important in order to avoid any part damage during demoulding. \r\nIn Chapter 6 micro stereolithography was used to fabricate mould inserts for micro injection moulding. Experiments were carried out with such mould inserts, and the tool life in relation to process settings for both the manufacture of the inserts and their replication performance, was studied systematically. \r\nFinally, Chapter 7 summarises the main conclusions and contributions to knowledge of this research. Also, future research directions in the area of micro injection moulding are proposed and briefly discussed \r\nThe main findings of this research can be summarised as follows: \r\n• Indirect measurement methods can be utilised to monitor cavity pressure conditions in micro injection moulding and it was shown that Pmax, Pwork and Prate were dependent on the materials and processing conditions. \r\n• The performance of the u-IM process can be improved by understanding the effects of V1 and air evacuation on Qmax, Q, and the part flow length. High u-IM process settings and a limited venting through the primary split line have a significant impact on the filling performance. The u-IM process performance can be improved by incorporating secondary vents and by applying vacuum methods for air evacuation. \r\n• Pmax, Pwork and Fe max were dependent on the processing conditions and there is a direct correlation between cavity pressure and demoulding force. The position of the pressure sensors is important, but the readings of both sensors correlate.\r\nThe holding pressure has the highest impact on the maximum demoulding forces. \r\nRapid tooling can be applied successfully in u-IM and offers a faster, cheaper and highly flexible manufacturing route for producing prototypes in the final material. Only the uSL inserts produced with a layer thickness of 20 um (less undercuts) survived during the demoulding stage. The best results were achieved with PP, followed by PC. ABS polymer parts couldn’t be replicated successfully.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scholz, Steffen Gerhard"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2795333,"sim:weight":0.249954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24911,"sim:weight":0.242881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222872,"sim:weight":0.219059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.195679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.191991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.186898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222802,"sim:weight":0.180075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821123,"sim:weight":0.148591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The main difficulty with cannabinoids is their psychotropic side effects,but access to the brain may be prevented by conjugating the cannabinoid to a bulkygroup such as a dendrimer. The aims of this thesis were to investigate the mechanism by which cannabinoids reduce gut motility and to investigate whether cannabinoids protect the intestine from inflammatory-damage. A further aim was to determine whether cannabinoids remain pharmacologically active when conjugated to a dendrimer.\r\n\r\nAll cannabinoids used (apart from arachidonoylcyclopropylamide and (-)WIN 55,212-2) caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the size of electrically-stimulated contractions in the guinea-pig ileum. The responses were not blocked by CB1, CB2, CBe(putative endothelial cannabinoid receptor) or GPR55 antagonists, suggesting that none of these receptors were involved in mediating cannabinoid responses.

Bacteria are able to degrade these harmful compounds, primarily by production of dehalogenating enzymes using them as sole sources of carbon and energy. Little is known about microbial adaptation during -haloacid (HA) degradation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate bacterial community and dehalogenase genes during degradation of 2-chloropropionic acid (2MCPA) in activated sludge and soil inoculated Ready Biodegradation Tests (RBT) format, using DNA based cultivation-independent and cultivation-dependent methods.\r\n\r\nChanges in the bacterial communities of activated sludge (AS) and soil (HS and LS) RBTs were monitored by analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA and HA dehalogenase (dehI \u0026 dehII) genes. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene DGGE profiles showed that several bacterial species (phylotypes) were persistent during 2MCPA degradation, whilst other phylotypes were either enriched or appeared transiently.\r\n\r\nSome changes in the bacterial communites were associated with appearance of deh genes. At lower inoculum concentration of soil (LS-RBT), 2MCPA degradation gave biphasic curve of dechlorination; the presence of a Comamonas phylotype during the initial stages of substrate degradation coincided with the presence of group II dehalogenases (dehII), and was replaced by Methylibium in the second phase of 2MCPA degradation, coinciding with the presence of a group I dehalogenases (dehI). However, in the high inoculum of soil (HS)-RBT and AS-RBT, 2MCPA degradation was completed more rapidly in a single phase, with enrichment of Herbaspirillum-like (in HS-RBT) phylotypes, and Caulobacter and Cupriavidus-like (in AS-RBT) phylotypes.\r\n\r\nSamples removed periodically from the RBTs were used to inoculate solid and liquid sub-cultures (2 or 10 mM 2MCPA) for further enrichment and isolation of 2MCPA-degrading bacteria. DGGE profiles of 16S rRNA gene sequences from the AS-RBT revealed considerable differences from those of the liquid sub-cultures, suggesting that degradation of 2MCPA was affected by and possibly determined by substrate concentration and presence of specific degraders in a system. \r\n\r\nThe isolates obtained from soil and AS-RBTs, whether or not they reflected the RBT, were mainly Alphaproteobacteria, indicating the importance of these bacteria in degrading 2MCPA. Four 2MCPA-degrading bacteria, Afipia sp. KH3, Rhizobium sp. KH31, Herbaspirillum sp. KH17 and Methylobacterium sp. KH4, were isolated in this study and characterized phylogenetically and with respect to their dehalogenases. Among the genes involved in 2MCPA degradation, the sequence of dehI of strain KH17 was identical to that of dehI of Herbaspirillum sp. DA1. \r\n\r\nThis study showed there is significant bias during liquid sub-culture process, and highlights the advantage of using molecular based (PCR-DGGE) methods in investigating the actual contribution of bacteria population in degrading xenobiotics (HAs).

Moreover, a novel mixing technique, trituration of encapsulated MTA, was developed. The effects of acid and blood contamination on various characteristics of MTA including compressive strength, surface microhardness, push-out bond strength and total porosity were then evaluated. Furthermore, by using X-ray diffraction analysis the hydration process of blood contaminated MTA was studied. In addition, the microstructure of contaminated MTA specimens was compared with control groups.\r\nResults: Methods of mixing and placing MTA significantly affected the hydration process and consequently the physical properties of the material. The lowest and greatest compressive strength, Vickers surface microhardness, and push-out strength values of MTA were found after exposure to pH levels of 4.4 and 7.4, respectively. In addition, scanning electron microscopy revealed a lack of needle-like crystals when the material was in contact with more acidic solutions. The hydration state of specimens partially mixed with blood was more complete than those mixed entirely with blood and less than specimens that were hydrated only with water.\r\nConclusion: In experimental investigations, use of controlled mixing and placement techniques when using MTA is essential in order to standardise specimen preparation. Delaying the placement of the final coronal restoration in clinical situations when MTA is contaminated is recommended so that the material can acquire sufficient physical properties to withstand the acid-etch procedure and the condensation pressures that occur during the placement of a restoration and/or produced through indirect masticatory forces.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nekoofar, Mohammad Hossein"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76963,"sim:weight":0.502603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107173,"sim:weight":0.177375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176859,"sim:weight":0.161073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316479,"sim:weight":0.149942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75415,"sim:weight":0.148993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77568,"sim:weight":0.144658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76038,"sim:weight":0.134956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631076,"sim:weight":0.132384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75634,"sim:weight":0.132177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76604,"sim:weight":0.130699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75920,"sim:weight":0.130073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77335,"sim:weight":0.129635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780062,"sim:weight":0.127833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75677,"sim:weight":0.127787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573417,"sim:weight":0.122869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75333,"sim:weight":0.121649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77263,"sim:weight":0.120938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631793,"sim:weight":0.119213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.116876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26546,"sim:weight":0.110439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These include approaches that target backbone as well as side chain changes, such as single amino acid deletions or whole domain insertion. The problem with utilizing these mutational approaches is the difficulty in predicting both local and global structural changes on changing the backbone conformation. The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the tolerance and beneficial influence of backbone targeted mutations using a mutant library-based screening approach, and to provide an understanding of their mechanism of action.\r\nA directed evolution transposon-based approach was used to generate libraries of single amino acid deletion and whole domain insertions into enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The later involved the insertion of cyt b562 as the donating insert domain. Library analysis revealed a wide range of sites were sampled across the backbone of EGFP. \r\nLibrary screening revealed widespread tolerance of EGFP to single amino acid deletions. Using the crystal structure of EGFP determined here, it was found that that loop regions where particularly tolerant. Two variants with residues G4 or A227 deleted conferred increased protein fluorescence to cell cultures with respect to EGFP. Spectral characterization and unfolding experiments identified that rather than altering the fluorescent properties of EGFP the mutations elicited their effects through altered protein folding and stability. \r\nScreening of the domain insert library revealed that sites spread along the backbone of EGFP were tolerant to cyt b562 insertion. Particularly tolerant were loops and the C-terminal end of β-strand 7, with the linker sequences playing a key role. One integral domain fusion scaffold, termed CG6, was identified in which the functions of the two individual domains were highly coupled. CG6 exhibited almost 100% fluorescence quenching upon the binding of haem to the cyt b562 domain. CG6 was also shown to potentially act as a sensor for redox state and reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 via a haem-dissociation dependent mechanism. The structure of CG6, determined by X-ray crystallography, provided the molecular basis for the functional coupling of the two domains. Critical was the side-by-side domain arrangement caused by differential linker lengths at the pivot position re-enforced by a domain-domain interface that placed the chromophores within 17-18Å of each other.\r\nFurther rational design of a cyt b562-EGFP integral fusion scaffold (CG15) was performed to create novel ratiometric fluorescent redox sensors, termed CG15CC variants. The CG15CC variants have been shown to have the most reducing redox midpoint potentials of any protein based redox sensor studied to date. One of the CG15CC variants also has the fastest redox kinetics observed to date.\r\nThe survey of the tolerance and influence of single amino acid deletions in EGFP conducted here has highlighted the potential beneficial nature of deletion mutagenesis and has helped provide a molecular understanding of their effect. Through domain insertion mutagenesis and retrospective structure analysis the mechanism behind the functional coupling of two domains has been described and will also help guide future work in the development of novel biomolecular switches.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arpino, James"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26920,"sim:weight":0.232166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.219274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84807,"sim:weight":0.216714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76783,"sim:weight":0.215605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76883,"sim:weight":0.208296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24487,"sim:weight":0.204032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222850,"sim:weight":0.202483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76272,"sim:weight":0.19079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75644,"sim:weight":0.188239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.160635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.159277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26718,"sim:weight":0.13185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.12691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A considerable number of approaches for quantifying functional similarity between gene products based on the semantic similarity between their annotations have been developed, but little guidance exists as to which of these measures are the most appropriate for different purposes. This was addressed here by comparing the performances of a number of similarity measures and associated parameters. This comparison provided some interesting new insights as well as confirming emerging trends from the literature.\r\n\r\nThere is also a pressing need for novel ways of applying these measures to facilitate the functional analysis of lists of gene products. We developed a novel algorithm, FuSiGroups, to group GO terms based on their semantic similarity and genes based on their functional similarity. This two-fold grouping results in groups of not only functionally similar genes but also an associated set of related GO terms that characterise a single functional aspect relating the genes in the group, which facilitates analysis by creating more coherent groups. Each gene can belong to multiple groups, so the groups more accurately reflect the complexity of biological reality than clusters generated using traditional approaches.\r\n\r\nFuSiGroups was tested on a number of scenarios and in each case, successfully generated biologically relevant groups, identifying the key functional aspects of the dataset. The algorithm also managed to eliminate genes that were functionally unrelated to the bulk of the dataset and distinguish between different biological pathways.

I begin by hypothesising that democracy may function as a ‘political theory’ (‘political’ in the sense used by Rawls in Political Liberalism) and ask whether adherents of different comprehensive worldviews could endorse democracy on that basis. I consider the discomfort that liberals, adherents of one particular worldview, have with democracy. I note that Berlin’s account of value pluralism may offer an understanding that allows liberals to value democracy. I consider justifications for electoral democracy (procedural and instrumental) and for deliberative democracy. I claim that procedural justifications for electoral democracy fail arguing that, in valuing democracy because of the alleged freedom given to individuals to influence political decision-making, procedural justifications misrepresent democracy. Rather electoral democracy is about different collective endeavours (i.e. the attempts to elect different candidates). Individual involvement is in the form of the opportunity to contribute to those collective endeavours but such opportunities are not of equal value and, thus, are not morally significant. I argue that deliberative democracy cannot function as a political theory. However, there are weighty arguments for electoral democracy on account of its instrumental value. The relationship, though, between an instrumentalist electoral democracy and comprehensive worldviews is necessarily problematic. Given the contingent nature of democratic outcomes, these will clash with the imperatives of comprehensive doctrines. For that reason and others, liberals and holders of other comprehensive doctrines do not relate to democracy as a political theory. I turn to an account of political settlements as modi vivendi. I argue that democracy is best understood as a component of modi vivendi. Liberals will still have difficulties with democracy but liberals have problems with any non-liberal outcome unless they accept a broadly Berlinian approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buchanan-Smith, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84868,"sim:weight":0.154221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.154018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85275,"sim:weight":0.135476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85872,"sim:weight":0.131041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75930,"sim:weight":0.129816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Contamination may lead to economic loss for manufacturers and also potentially pose a risk\r\nto the health of vulnerable consumers. Understanding the interaction between Bcc bacteria and preservatives,\r\nand the molecular basis for their resistance, is essential in order to better target these organisms and to facilitate\r\nthe implementation of improved preservative strategies which target resistance mechanisms.\r\nIn the present study, multi-locus sequence typing analysis of a collection of 67 Bcc isolates from environmentalindustrial\r\nsources was used to expand the current knowledge of Bcc species diversity within this niche and\r\nidentified B. lata (n\u003d17) and B. cenocepacia (n\u003d11) as predominant species groups. The relationship between\r\nBcc species diversity, isolation source and preservative susceptibility was investigated using a collection of 83\r\ngenetically diverse Bcc strains from clinical, environmental and environmental-industrial isolation sources.\r\nSusceptibility to eight preservatives was not related to Bcc taxonomy, as susceptibility profiles varied both\r\nbetween and within species groups. However, Bcc isolates from environmental-industrial sources had a\r\nsignificantly higher minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC and MBC) for the\r\nformaldehyde releasing agent DMDM hydantoin. This suggests that for this preservative agent, susceptibility\r\nwas related to source and that the selection of highly tolerant Bcc bacteria had occurred within the niche.\r\nIsothiazolone, DMDM hydantoin, phenoxyethanol and methyl paraben preservatives were observed to be highly\r\nefficacious against Bcc bacteria when evaluated in growth medium at the maximum concentration regulated for\r\nuse in rinse-off personal care products in EU-regulated countries. Benzethonium chloride and sodium benzoate\r\npreservatives had the weakest anti-Bcc activity at these levels but were effective against several strains.\r\nCombinations of preservatives, and preservatives with potentiating agents, were evaluated for synergistic anti-\r\nBcc activity. The greatest anti-Bcc activity was observed when isothiazolone preservatives were combined with\r\nEDTA or phenoxyethanol, with each combination resulting in an additive effect. The competency of Bcc\r\nbacteria to adapt to preservatives was explored via the progressive sub-culture of B. lata strain 383 in subinhibitory\r\npreservative concentrations. This genome sequence strain represented a Bcc species commonly\r\nencountered in the environmental-industrial niche. Stable adaptive-resistance to isothiazolone and benzethonium\r\nchloride preservatives was developed. Phenoxyethanol, DMDM hydantoin and methyl paraben preservatives\r\nwere recalcitrant to B. lata strain 383 adaptation. The preservative and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the\r\nadapted B. lata strain 383 derivatives differed, suggesting the induction of agent-specific adaptive-resistance\r\nmechanisms had occurred. The B. lata 383-CMIT,-BIT, derivatives (adapted respectively to\r\nchloromethylisothiazolinone and benzisothiazolinone), demonstrated cross-resistance to isothiazolone\r\npreservatives and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Sequence analysis of the topoisomerase genes in these derivatives\r\nrevealed fluoroquinolone resistance was not mediated by target modification. Preservative-induced adaptive\r\nresistance was not associated with overall increased multi-drug resistance.\r\nThe molecular basis for resistance to DMDM hydantoin and isothiazolone preservatives was investigated via the\r\nrandom transposon mutagenesis of B. lata strain 383 using pTnModOTp’. Several genetic pathways were\r\nidentified as putative preservative resistance determinants, suggesting that resistance is multi-factorial. These\r\nincluded the detoxification of formaldehyde via a glutathione-dependent pathway; a type II general secretory\r\nsystem (A3244_A3233 genes); a homologue of an ABC-type efflux system involved in resistance to organic\r\nsolvents (A3512_A3517 genes); homologues of multi-drug RND-type efflux systems EmrB/QacA-Emr-TolC;\r\nand bacterial defence mechanisms against oxidative stress.\r\nA transcriptomic microarray-based approach was used to profile global gene expression of B. lata strain 383 in\r\nresponse to sub-MIC of 0.00162% DMDM hydantoin and 0.00001498% of a methylisothiazolinone and CMIT\r\nblend, as well as isothiazolone-induced adaptive resistance. With a 1.5-fold change and P \u003c 0.05 confidence\r\nlevel criterion applied, few significant changes were observed after a single sub-MIC exposure, and the\r\ndifferential expression of putative resistance determinants identified by transposon mutagenesis was not induced\r\nat these concentrations. Isothiazolone-induced adaptive-resistance involved a greater number of significant gene\r\nexpression changes that were stable irrespective of the presence of the priming agent, with 126 up-regulated and\r\n90 down-regulated genes. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that isothiazolone-induced adaptive resistance was\r\nmulti-factorial in nature, and identified active efflux as a putative key resistance mechanism. A novel role for a\r\nRND-type efflux system (B1004_B1006 genes) was identified, and the up-regulation of the ABC-efflux system\r\n(A3512_A3517 genes) and bacterial defence mechanisms against oxidative stress corroborated the transposon\r\nmutagenesis findings. B. lata strain 383-CMIT demonstrated a four-fold reduction in MIC for the priming\r\npreservative (2.81E-04%) in the presence of 512 mg/L of the efflux inhibitor PAβN. Resistance mechanism\r\ntargeted preservative strategies such as using efflux inhibitors may work to improve preservation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thomas , Laura"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1643700,"sim:weight":0.186767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76202,"sim:weight":0.176246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.15189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.147605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.147605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77267,"sim:weight":0.141973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.133497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76816,"sim:weight":0.13172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826716,"sim:weight":0.129207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222944,"sim:weight":0.128745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75896,"sim:weight":0.1267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75835,"sim:weight":0.12625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.123131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222853,"sim:weight":0.115017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.101077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The majority of injuries of children under five and people aged 75 and over, occur at home. Multifactorial injury prevention interventions have been shown to reduce injuries in the home. However, few studies have focused specifically on the impact of physical adaptations to the home environment and the effectiveness of such interventions needs to be ascertained.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES: To review the evidence for the effect on injuries of modification of the home environment with a primary focus on interventions to reduce physical hazards.\r\n\r\nSEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, National Research Register and other specialised databases. We also scanned conference proceedings and reference lists. In addition, we contacted experts and trialists in the field. The searches were not restricted by language or publication status. The searches were last updated in December 2004.\r\n\r\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials.\r\n\r\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All abstracts were screened by two authors for relevance, outcome and design. Two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data from each eligible study.\r\n\r\nMAIN RESULTS: We found 18 published and one unpublished trials. Trials were not sufficiently similar to allow pooling of data by statistical analyses, so this review takes a narrative form. Studies were divided into three groups based on the primary population sample; children (five studies), older people (14 studies) and the general population/mixed age group (no studies). None of the studies focusing on children demonstrated a reduction in injuries that might have been due to environmental adaptation in the home; one study reported a reduction in injuries and in hazards but the two could not be linked. Of the 14 included studies in older people, none demonstrated a reduction in injuries due to hazard reduction, although two demonstrated a reduction in falls that could be due to hazard reduction.\r\n\r\nAUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of interventions to modify environmental home hazards. Further interventions to reduce hazards in the home should be evaluated by adequately designed randomised controlled trials measuring injury outcomes.

Previous home injuries research has tended to focus on behaviours or the provision of safety equipment to families with young children. There has been little consideration of the physical environment. This study reports methodological developments in database linkage and analysis to improve researchers abilities to utilise large administrative and clinical databases to carry out health and health services research. \r\nMethods\r\nThe study involved linking a database of home injuries obtained from an emergency department surveillance system with an external survey of all homes in an area and population denominators for home types derived from a health service administrative database. Analysis of injury incidence by housing type was adjusted for potential biases due to deprivation and distance to hospital. For non-injured individuals data confidentiality considerations required the deprivation and distance measures be imputed. The process of randomly imputing these variables and the testing of the validity of this approach is detailed. \r\nResults\r\nThere were 14,081 first injuries in 112,248 residents living in 54,081 homes over a two-year period. The imputation method worked well with imputed and observed measures in the injured group being very similar. Re-randomisation and a repeated analysis gave identical results to the first analysis. One particular housing type had a substantially elevated odds ratio for injury occurrence, OR \u003d 2.07 (95% CI: 1.87 to 2.30). \r\nConclusions\r\nThe method of data linkage, imputation and statistical analysis used provides a basis for improved analysis of database linkage studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Newcombe, Robert Gordon","Lyons, Ronan Anthony","Jones, Sarah J.","Patterson, Joanne Louise"],"dc:date":"2005-02","doi":"10.1186/1472-6963-5-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.215926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77003,"sim:weight":0.201297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.191762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631868,"sim:weight":0.180967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.175503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76340,"sim:weight":0.162182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56640,"sim:weight":0.1532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, we focus on understanding the influence of the magnitude of the Clapeyron slope (as measured by the Phase Buoyancy parameter, P) and the vigour of convection (as measured by the Rayleigh number, Ra) on mantle convection. We have undertaken 76 simulations of isoviscous mantle convection in spherical geometry, varying Ra and P. Three domains of behaviour were found: layered convection for high Ra and more negative P, whole mantle convection for low Ra and less negative P, and transitional behaviour in an intervening domain. The boundary between the layered and transitional domain was fit by a curve P \u003d α Raβ where α \u003d −1.05, and β \u003d −0.1, and the fit for the boundary between the transitional and whole mantle convection domain was α \u003d −4.8, and β \u003d −0.25. These two curves converge at Ra ≈ 2.5 × 104 (well below Earth mantle vigour) and P \u0026approx; −0.38. Extrapolating to high Ra, which is likely earlier in Earth history, this work suggests a large transitional domain. It is therefore likely that convection in the Archean would have been influenced by this phase change, with Earth being at least in the transitional domain, if not the layered domain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wolstencroft, Martin","Davies, John Huw"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.5194/se-2-315-2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75703,"sim:weight":0.423583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66283,"sim:weight":0.330318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66273,"sim:weight":0.309732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66282,"sim:weight":0.291185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26713,"sim:weight":0.258991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26000,"sim:weight":0.248601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66281,"sim:weight":0.193406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109191,"sim:weight":0.150997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448009,"sim:weight":0.129246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A previous publication (Langmuir2002, 18, 3014) suggested there should be an ideal fluorination level: for optimization of possible process applications in CO2, it is important to establish just how little F is needed to render a surfactant CO2-philic. Here, optimum chemical structures for water-in-CO2 (w/c) microemulsion stabilization are identified through a systematic study of CO2-philic surfactant design based on dichain sulfosuccinates. High pressure small-angle neutron scattering (HP-SANS) measurements of reversed micelle formation in CO2 show a clear relationship between F content and CO2 compatibility of any given surfactant. Interestingly, high F content surfactants, having lower limiting aqueous surface tensions, γcmc, also have better performance in CO2, as indicated by lower cloud point pressures, Ptrans. The results have important implications for the rational design of CO2-philic surfactants helping to identify the most economic and efficient compounds for emerging CO2 based fluid technologies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohamed, Azmi","Sagisaka, Masanobu","Guittard, Frederic","Cummings, Stephen","Paul, Alison","Rogers, Sarah E.","Heenan, Richard K.","Dyer, Robert","Eastoe, Julian"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1021/la2021885","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109207,"sim:weight":0.16801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795349,"sim:weight":0.158457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108488,"sim:weight":0.156538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85207,"sim:weight":0.152838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85877,"sim:weight":0.152434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222813,"sim:weight":0.13883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108054,"sim:weight":0.129278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75501,"sim:weight":0.103402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84820,"sim:weight":0.0944182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76936,"sim:weight":0.0941653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108077,"sim:weight":0.0875796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.0755506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631819,"sim:weight":0.0677037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108521,"sim:weight":0.0670011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631673,"sim:weight":0.0660051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Lethal photosensitisation is a possible solution as it is capable of inactivating microorganisms through the generation of reactive oxygen species. Previously we have shown that a Methylene Blue and gold nanoparticle-embedded silicone material has antimicrobial properties against planktonic bacteria when exposed to laser light. In this work the material has been tested for its ability to reduce the formation of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms. Biofilm formation was observed over time using a flow cell which was arranged to allow laser irradiation in situ. The duration and frequency of light exposure were changed so that the same amount of energy was delivered during each experiment. Neither short (5 min) but frequent (every 30 min) irradiation nor long (20 min) and infrequent (every 120 min) exposure was able to significantly prevent biofilm formation; they resulted in 75% and 60%, respectively, of the surface covered by the biofilm after 6 hour of colonization compared to 100% coverage when no laser was used. However, when laser irradiation was performed for 10 min every 60 min, a reduction in biofilm coverage of greater than 50% was observed compared to untreated silicone. The properties of the materials post-irradiation were also evaluated; the surface roughness of the material, the asperity density and the asperity height showed a continuous decrease with energy dose. However, the elasticity (Young\u0027s module) was not affected by the irradiation. This appears to be a promising novel light-activated material which, as well as displaying antimicrobial activity, has been shown for the first time capable of reducing biofilm formation over time.","bibo:AuthorList":["Perni, S.","Prokopovich, Polina","Parkin, I.

It has been dubbed “the silent killer” because of its non-specific symptoms. Amongst various imaging modalities, ultrasound is considered the main modality for ovarian cancer triage. Like other imaging modalities, the main issue is that the interpretation of the images is subjective and observer dependent. In order to overcome this problem, texture analysis was considered for this study. Advances in medical imaging, computer technology and image processing have collectively ramped up the interest of many researchers in texture analysis. While there have been a number of successful uses of texture analysis technique reported, to my knowledge, until recently it has yet to be applied to characterise an ovarian lesion from a B-mode image. The concept of applying texture analysis in the medical field would not replace the conventional method of interpreting images but is simply intended to aid clinicians in making their diagnoses.\r\nFive categories of textural features were considered in this study: grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Run Length Matrix (RLM), gradient, auto-regressive (AR) and wavelet. Prior to the image classification, the robustness or how well a specific textural feature can tolerate variation arises from the image acquisition and texture extraction process was first evaluated. This includes random variation caused by the ultrasound system and the operator during image acquisition. Other factors include the influence of region of interest (ROI) size, ROI depth, scanner gain setting, and „calliper line‟. Evaluation of scanning reliability was carried out using a tissue-equivalent phantom as well as evaluations of a clinical environment.\r\niii\r\nAdditionally, the reliability of the ROI delineation procedure for clinical images was also evaluated. An image enhancement technique and semi-automatic segmentation tool were employed in order to improve the ROI delineation procedure. The results of the study indicated that two out of five textural features, GLCM and wavelet, were robust. Hence, these two features were then used for image classification purposes.\r\nTo extract textural features from the clinical images, two ROI delineation approaches were introduced: (i) the textural features were extracted from the whole area of the tissue of interest, and (ii) the anechoic area within the normal and malignant tissues was excluded from features extraction. The results revealed that the second approach outperformed the first approach: there is a significant difference in the GLCM and wavelet features between the three groups: normal tissue, cysts, and malignant. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was carried out to determine the discriminatory ability of textural features, which was found to be satisfactory.\r\nThe principal conclusion was that GLCM and wavelet features can potentially be used as computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tools to help clinicians in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ab.

The majority of injuries to children under five and people aged 75 and older occur at home. Multifactorial injury prevention interventions have been shown to reduce injuries in the home. However, few studies have focused specifically on the impact of physical adaptations to the home environment and the effectiveness of such interventions needs to be ascertained.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nTo determine the effect of modifications to the home environment on the reduction of injuries due to environmental hazards.\r\n\r\nSearch strategy\r\nWe searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other specialised databases. We also scanned conference proceedings and reference lists. We contacted the first author of all included randomised controlled trials. The searches were last updated to the end of December 2009, and were not restricted by language or publication status.\r\n\r\nSelection criteria\r\nRandomised controlled trials.\r\n\r\nData collection and analysis\r\nTwo authors screened all abstracts for relevance, outcome and design. Two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data from each eligible study. We performed meta-analysis to combine effect measures, using a random-effects model. We assessed heterogeneity using an I2 statistic and a Chi2 test.\r\n\r\nMain results\r\nWe found 28 published studies and one unpublished study. Only two studies were sufficiently similar to allow pooling of data for statistical analyses. Studies were divided into three groups; children, older people and the general population/mixed age group. None of the studies focusing on children or older people demonstrated a reduction in injuries that were a direct result of environmental modification in the home. One study in older people demonstrated a reduction in falls and one a reduction in falls and injurious falls that may have been due to hazard reduction. One meta-analysis was performed which examined the effects on falls of multifactorial interventions consisting of home hazard assessment and modification, medication review, health and bone assessment and exercise (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.23).\r\n\r\nAuthors\u0027 conclusions\r\nThere is insufficient evidence to determine whether interventions focused on modifying environmental home hazards reduce injuries. Further interventions to reduce hazards in the home should be evaluated by adequately designed randomised controlled trials measuring injury outcomes. Recruitment of large study samples to measure effect must be a major consideration for future trials. Researchers should also consider using factorial designs to allow the evaluation of individual components of multifactorial interventions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, Samantha","Arthur, Geri","Lyons, Ronan A","Weightman, Alison Lesley","Mann, Mala K.","Jones, Sarah J.","John, Ann","Lannon, Simon Charles"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1002/14651858.CD003600.pub3","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.317672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.261487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.255571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.25081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8747712,"sim:weight":0.239898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223134,"sim:weight":0.237404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.233894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.228343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77003,"sim:weight":0.224499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632014,"sim:weight":0.219292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.21067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632065,"sim:weight":0.192088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632064,"sim:weight":0.192088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75310,"sim:weight":0.191645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631335,"sim:weight":0.183826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25872,"sim:weight":0.181906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.175848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75620,"sim:weight":0.166449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25871,"sim:weight":0.154369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The design of microneedle devices has significantly developed over\r\nrecent years to allow for the delivery of numerous compounds into in vivo and ex vivo skin. Microneedle\r\ndevices are now beginning to be taken away from the laboratory and towards clinical use but to achieve\r\nthis it is desirable that all microneedles within the device penetrate skin in vivo to a sufficient depth. As\r\nmicroneedle devices have been extensively tested in cadaver tissue, a greater understanding of the\r\nmechanical properties of skin in vivo and ex vivo is required and to hypothesise whether animal models\r\nsuch as murine skin ex vivo serves as an appropriate model for human skin ex vivo.\r\nMeasurements were performed on human skin in vivo by applying small cylindrical and spherical\r\nindenters to the volar aspect of the forearm on 7 volunteers. The average Young’s Modulus of the skin\r\nwas 39.64kPa and 65.86kPa when applying the spherical and cylindrical indenters respectively. In a\r\nseries of tensile measurements performed at three load axis orientations using ex vivo samples from\r\nhuman and murine donors, it was found that the key variation was attributed to the deformation\r\nexperienced at initial low loads. This was shown to be significantly longer for human skin with an\r\naverage of 5.10mm, when compared with murine skin which had an average of 1.61mm (p\u003c0.05).\r\nHistological examination showed that human skin was far thicker, with an increased volume of dermal\r\ntissue, compared with murine skin, and this anatomical variation may have been the main reason why\r\nhuman and murine skin exhibited different mechanical properties.\r\nFinite element models (FEMs) were established of skin indentation in vivo, which incorporated the\r\nepidermis, dermis and hypodermis, and of human and murine skin in tension. Appropriate boundary\r\nconditions and mesh densities were implemented and the geometries were taken from real life\r\nmeasurements where possible. The Ogden material model of hyperelasticity was chosen to represent\r\nthe skin layers for the FEM of skin indentation and an anisotropic material was used to describe human\r\nand murine skin in tension by adapting the Weiss et al model of transverse isotropy.\r\nInverse finite element analysis was then used to match the FEMs with the experimental measurements.\r\nThe multilayered FEM of skin was correlated against the in vivo indentation tests where model and\r\nexperimental fit gave average root mean squared errors (R2\r\nave) of between 0.00103 and 0.0488 for the 7\r\nvolunteers. The optimal material parameters showed correlations with experimental measurements,\r\nwhere volunteers 1, 6 and 7 were shown to have the stiffest skin through Young’s Modulus calculations,\r\nwhich was reflected in the increased nonlinearity of the parameters extracted for the hypodermal layer.\r\nA stronger agreement between model and experiment for the anisotropic model of human and murine\r\nskin in tension was shown where the R2\r\nave was between 0.0038 and 0.0163. Again, model and\r\nexperimental observations were shown to correlate where there was a significant difference (p\u003c0.05)\r\nbetween 6 of the 14 average material parameters (C2, C3,1, λ1, C3,2, C3,3, λ3) when comparing human to\r\nmurine skin.\r\nThe multilayered FEM of human skin in vivo was further validated by modelling the application of a\r\nsingle microneedle to skin, prior to penetration. The model was then correlated against in vivo\r\nmeasurements performed on one of the volunteers and it was found that the model provided a good\r\napproximation for the experimental measurements. Using the multilayered FEM of human skin\r\nindentation, it was possible to model the deflection of the skin during the application of a pressure load\r\ncomparable to microneedle array application. This allowed for the development of several curved\r\nmicroneedle arrays which aimed to distribute the load over all microneedles to potentially create uniform\r\nskin penetration by all those within the array. The microneedles were manufactured simply and quickly\r\nusing wire cutting technologies from stainless steel and tested in human skin in vivo and in ex vivo\r\nsamples of human and murine skin, where methylene blue was applied to identify any microchannels\r\ncreated by the microneedles. Preliminary measurements taken from murine skin ex vivo were\r\ndiscounted as microchannel staining was not possible. Analyses performed on human skin ex vivo\r\nshowed penetration at high loads (4-5N) for all four microneedle array designs and the microneedle\r\narray with the smallest curvature (0.95mm) had the most consistent puncture for all microneedles,\r\nhowever puncture in vivo was difficult to characterise using approach developed. Therefore further work\r\nis required to assess more volunteers and donors.\r\nThis study has highlighted the great differences in the mechanical properties of human and murine skin,\r\nsuggesting that murine skin is not an appropriate model to assess microneedle puncture. It has also\r\nshown that the underlying tissues and hypodermis play a pivotal role in microneedle insertion mechanics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Groves, Rachel"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222802,"sim:weight":0.27211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77153,"sim:weight":0.251917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75539,"sim:weight":0.232822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.224202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.174612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26442,"sim:weight":0.172205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.169513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.16251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.161954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.145378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.133086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5532,"sim:weight":0.129927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.12215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108322,"sim:weight":0.119858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27089,"sim:weight":0.119786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25819,"sim:weight":0.111102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22872,"sim:weight":0.107508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76748,"sim:weight":0.0973307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56580,"sim:weight":0.0915493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76480,"sim:weight":0.0872617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Highly skilled individuals are normally perceived as valuable resources that a country should foster and even, if possible, attract from other states (Meyer and Brown, 1999). Unfortunately, Italian statutory provisions aimed at regulating immigration focus on limiting immigration without a reasoned distinction between skilled and unskilled immigrants. \r\nThe paper reflects on the reasons for the parochial structure of the Italian white-collar market – which is mainly cultural - and its effects. In the past decades, Italy\u0027s private and public sectors have suffered the effects of a “brain drain” of a wide range of highly skilled professionals (Becker, Ichino and Peri, 2003). A series of reasons, such as the fact that Italy is - and has been for some time - one of the world\u0027s most sluggish, heavily industrialised economies (Hornby, Mackenzie, 2011), might explain the departure of skilled individuals from the Italian job market. Italy’s lack of economic growth in the private sector (and the related high unemployment rate) “pushes” away highly skilled individuals from areas of oversupply (e.g. Italy) to strong economies (e.g. Australia) where particular abilities are in demand. \r\nThe paper would like to address the issue by suggesting the introduction of a medium/long-term visa for highly skilled individuals (Ottonelli and Torresi, 2010), and by promoting the establishment of private multinational universities modelled on the European Institute in Florence. These new institutions would open the academic job market to overseas researchers and at the same time provide a more solid base for the retrieval of Italian academics working abroad. The paper is divided in two sections which are preceded by an introduction. The first section deals with the Italian immigration statutory provisions. The second explains the policies that might increase the efficiency of the Italian market for elite employees.","bibo:AuthorList":["Breda, Vito"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.22457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.214003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.21175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.19811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.19811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76873,"sim:weight":0.182646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108065,"sim:weight":0.131112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The neurotoxin was injected at three different regions along the nigrostriatal tract to produce unique patterns of dopaminergic cell death in the midbrain. The resulting cell loss was correlated to behavioural deficits identified through an extensive battery of motor hand tests. \r\nFully lesioned mice from each of the three models were chosen for chronic L-DOPA treatment, described in Chapter 4, where doses were increased every 1-2 weeks. Behaviour was assessed and correlated to deficits on motor hand tests prior to L-DOPA treatment, cell loss within sub regions of the midbrain, serotonergic density levels and upregulations in ΔFosB and striatal TH cell populations. \r\nChapter 5 uses knowledge gained in previous chapters to use the most appropriate 6-OHDA mouse model of LID for the examination of changes in the Regulators of G-protein Signalling (RGS) following an acute and chronic L-DOPA treatment. RGS2 was the only one to increase significantly following either treatment regime.\r\nIn Chapter 6 a well established rat model of GID (the induction of dyskinesia in the transplanted 6-OHDA lesioned rat through the administration of amphetamine) was used to assess the use of pharmacological agents known to reduce LID.  Changes in locomotor function and abnormal inhibitory movements (AIMs) could be assessed giving an insight into the mechanism and receptors involved. \r\nTo further the understanding of GID, Chapter 7 examines dopamine receptor levels, RGS transcript expression, and the proportions of dopamine and serotonin cells in the transplanted, 6-OHDA lesioned rodent brain. The aim was to determine any correlation between these parameters and amphetamine induced dyskinesia. Only the number of dopaminergic and serotonin cells could be correlated to dyskinesia and not the proportion of serotonin cells.\r\nAs no previous mouse model of GID has been established, Chapter 8 demonstrates that transplantation of E12 ventral mesencephalon (VM) grafts can be optimised in the lesioned mouse of C57/Bl6 and CD1 strains to give functional recovery, and amphetamine induced dyskinesia.  Both strains were also used to demonstrate that transplants were also able to reduce LID.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Gaynor"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.204138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360880,"sim:weight":0.183977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222897,"sim:weight":0.168775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.162138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.159543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105102,"sim:weight":0.157425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.153283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.150088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26514,"sim:weight":0.148429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.137638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.122111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76111,"sim:weight":0.118851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631544,"sim:weight":0.114671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I argue that the communication process is carried out in two ways: through interactional expertise that is based on deep comprehension when the interaction is between  micro-cultures that are sociologically closely connected, and through lower forms of knowledge relying on trust for the micro-cultures that are sociologically far apart.\r\nBecause the SEE framework is strongly based on the transmission of tacit knowledge, an analysis of the importance of tacit knowledge in theoretical physics is carried out to support the SEE analysis, and specific types of tacit knowledge are closely examined to understand how they shape theoretical physics practice.

I propose that negative anticipated group-based emotions serve the\r\nsocial function of promoting moral intergroup behaviour. I argue that aversive\r\nanticipated group-based emotions (such as shame) signal the harmful consequences of a\r\nfuture ingroup action and that the desire to avoid these aversive consequences motivates\r\ngroup members to inhibit immoral intergroup behaviour. The research in this thesis\r\ninvestigates the role of anticipated group-based guilt and shame in promoting moral and\r\ninhibiting immoral intergroup behaviour.\r\nIn Chapter 2, I found that anticipated group-based shame and ingroup-directed\r\nanger (but not guilt) positively predicted collective action against a proposed ingroup\r\ntransgression.

Finally, we combine the best features of both concepts to develop a new approach for the design of experiments for correlated observations, and it is demonstrated that the resulting design problems are related to the (logarithmic) potential theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhigljavsky, Anatoly Alexandrovich","Dette, Holger","Pepelyshev, Andrey"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1198/jasa.2010.tm09467","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26229,"sim:weight":0.40146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827213,"sim:weight":0.396124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24839,"sim:weight":0.375541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27917,"sim:weight":0.363551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23199,"sim:weight":0.331682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106932,"sim:weight":0.330143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31466,"sim:weight":0.243151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26799,"sim:weight":0.225321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18442,"sim:weight":0.222998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512483,"sim:weight":0.221024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147576,"sim:weight":0.220997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85460,"sim:weight":0.2073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.190659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20346,"sim:weight":0.190393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931792,"sim:weight":0.189882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26015,"sim:weight":0.175684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75591,"sim:weight":0.165075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.142517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21501,"sim:weight":0.133739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its central questions are:\r\n1. How are sound and music used to signify characters’ subjective experiences and what makes these uses of sound apt signifiers for signifying these states of mind?\r\n2. Is it possible to investigate this issue using a multidisciplinary approach that combines film theory and sound semiotics?\r\nThis study focuses on how characters’ subjective experiences of altered states are signified by eliminating either atmosphere or realistic sound effects or by the mixture of reality and unreality (e.g. intoxication where voiceovers and music are used to signify characters’ subjective experiences). It will explore how sound semiotics and film sound theory can be used to understand how soundtracks are used to signify filmic characters’ subjective experiences of altered states as well as investigating the most appropriate terminologies and transcription methods that may be used for this purpose. It will also discuss how film directors, such as Hitchcock, have created innovative solutions for conveying subjective modality in cinema.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gabriel, Gilbert"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The emphasis on teaching the body, structure and function can detract from the importance of the whole patient experience. The World Health Organisation’s drive for ‘Healthcare ‘to also consider activities and participation, including personal and environmental factors in service delivery, demands a holistic approach.\r\n\r\nA novel teaching approach was explored to facilitate students interviewing expert patients in small groups. The objective for the session was to facilitate students understanding of the psychological impact of a range of specified neurological conditions. Through this learning opportunity to be able to identify and recognise the psychological needs of individuals and to analyse ‘patient focussed working’ from expert patient experiences. This included increasing their awareness of different social backgrounds.\r\n  \r\nStudents attended for half a day and were able to interview 2-3 expert patients. The positive perspectives the contributors gave changed the student’s perceptions about neurological illnesses. A feedback plenary brought all the students together with the expert patients and the lecturers. Formal feedback was obtained by a short questionnaire with open questions and the University Quality Assurance online system. 82% of students strongly agreed that the content and delivery of the session had met their expectations. In fact many comments were asking for more time to be given to this type of learning experience.\r\n\r\nThis learning opportunity enhanced the curriculum delivery and broadened the students understanding of the psychosocial issues and the psychological impact of neurological illness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pickering, Dawn"],"dc:date":"2011-07-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77721,"sim:weight":0.43886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.418995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.40248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.401895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.39925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.391837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77452,"sim:weight":0.387847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.386896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.370887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88253,"sim:weight":0.365109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55530,"sim:weight":0.363522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.355711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.344927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.343962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.342402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.340755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76136,"sim:weight":0.334977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76134,"sim:weight":0.314412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2754878,"sim:weight":0.308498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77536,"sim:weight":0.307481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Adapted Dynamic Cycling (ADC) is one such activity that offers children with CP a recreational activity. \r\nMethods:\r\nA mixed methodology was used of physical measurements and interviews. The qualitative data is reported here. Two semi structured interviews were carried out with 17 parents and children at the beginning and end of 6 ADC sessions. Data was collected by Dictaphone/Video with an appropriate adult present to assist with the variety of communication styles used by the children. A cycling diary was kept and was referred to in the second interview. This data was transcribed and verified and is currently being analysed by open coding for themes. 88\r\nResults: \r\nThe coding of themes is being triangulated with other researchers to check for accuracy. The data demonstrates some facilitators and barriers to adapted dynamic cycling. ADC enabled children with CP to play and explore beyond their previous experience. These socially constructed stories provide greater understanding of the experiences of ADC for children with CP.\r\n Discussion:\r\nSome children showed remarkable achievements in cycling skills, endurance and social development. Despite some barriers, the experience of ADC for children with CP increased their potential for participation. Wider access to ADC needs further exploration. \r\nConclusion:\r\nThe current focus of rehabilitation needs to develop to enhance the participation of children with CP in appropriate activities that promotes their health and social independence and provide them with the opportunity for outstanding personal achievements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pickering, Dawn","Horrocks, Lyn"],"dc:date":"2011-02-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.325005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.321711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631825,"sim:weight":0.276747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.265871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632042,"sim:weight":0.229423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76428,"sim:weight":0.214577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10910,"sim:weight":0.203077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.199847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75276,"sim:weight":0.18765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.180325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.173346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.167312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.140663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77721,"sim:weight":0.137275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632061,"sim:weight":0.132519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2823041,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"SEMG investigation of lower limb and abdominal muscles during progressions of a core stability exercise","bibo:abstract":"Background:  The loss of selective muscle activity in the trunk is a fundamental problem experienced by patients after a Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA) (Davies, 1990).  The return of trunk control is vital for the performance of activities of daily living and hence is a key focus in the rehabilitation of CVA patients (De Seze et al, 2001).  The posterior pelvic tilt exercise (PPTE) is commonly used during neurological rehabilitation to retrain the trunk muscles and improve core stability.  Progressions of this exercise are commonly used in order to advance the rehabilitation program and enable the patient to achieve maximal independence (Wade, 1992).  Two of the progressions commonly used, involve the performance of the basic exercise together with a unilateral leg drop out or a bilateral arm raise.  Despite their frequent use, there is no evidence to either support or refute their effectiveness from a neurological perspective.  Furthermore, in patients with poor core stability it is often necessary for them to use limb compensation/fixation in order to function. However, this has also not been evaluated in the evidence.  Considering the gaps in research, this study will investigate the difference in average surface electromyography (SEMG) muscle activity of internal oblique (IO) and external oblique (EO) when performing a baseline PPTE compared with i) a PPTE with a bilateral arm raise and ii) a PPTE with a unilateral leg drop out. SEMG will also simultaneously record activity in Quadriceps and hamstrings during the three conditions.\r\nObjectives: The aims of the study are to 1)examine whether the progression exercises increase mean abdominal muscle activity compared with the basic PPTE and therefore justify its use as a progression in the clinical setting. 2) evaluate the compensatory/ fixation activity of Quadriceps and hamstrings during all three conditions.\r\nMethodology:  A healthy subject group consisting of 19 females and 3males ranging from 20 to 26 years (mean 21.5 years ±1.57), from Cardiff University, volunteered to take part in this study.  They signed a consent form after reading an information sheet and following a 24hour contemplation time. A health questionnaire was completed and this acted as an exclusion criteria (eg. Present back pain, pregnancy, recent surgery).  The research protocol was standardised and SEMG was used to measure the muscle activity of IO and EO whilst each subject performed all three conditions i) baseline PPTE ii) PPTE plus unilateral leg drop out iii) PPTE plus bilateral arm raise  These were repeated three times with 30 seconds between recordings to reduce the effects of fatigue.  To minimise the order effect, 11 subjects performed the PPTE followed by the PPTE with the progressions and visa versa for the other 11 subjects.  The SEMG procedure was standardised for electrode placement, skin preparation and instructions. The SEMG recording was normalised against a maximal voluntary contraction for each muscle and then averaged for all three conditions over a duration of 10 seconds.  Statistical analysis used a one way ANOVA with a post hoc t test. Significance set at p\u003d\u003c0.05.\r\nResults:\r\n1) abdo data – REO – (p\u003d0.034), LIO (0.051/0.071). RIO / LEO none statistically sig\r\n\r\n2) leg data – \r\nR hamstring ONLY - (p\u003d0.000) between unilateral leg drop out and bilateral arm raise. Due to performance of Right leg drop – therefore right hamstring switches off during drop making statistical sig when it is recruited for arm raise.L hamstrings / R Quad/ L Quad – not significant – could imply that legs not used to fix in this population. However graph implies that with harder stability ex (arm raise) hamstring activity is increased.\r\n\r\nConclusion:  The average bilateral SEMG muscle activity of IO and EO was found to be significantly higher when performing the progression compared with the basic PPTE.  Therefore, the study indicates that the PPTE is more effective when performed with a bilateral arm raise and could be used to retrain IO and EO in healthy subjects.  Consequently, the use of these exercises during the re-training of core stability is justified.  It is essential however, that further research is carried out in order to support these findings.  It is necessary that this future research be conducted on a sample of neurologically impaired patients, with the purpose of fully understanding the effects of the progression of the PPTE in the neurological setting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Karen","Adcock, Sophie","McCarthy, Holly"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75274,"sim:weight":0.359615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10910,"sim:weight":0.287441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.281273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631989,"sim:weight":0.238126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.236522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.235844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.225956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.225123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109108,"sim:weight":0.22376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.214271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631511,"sim:weight":0.211532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77770,"sim:weight":0.210655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.207954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632061,"sim:weight":0.202082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.199235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26590,"sim:weight":0.178995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75630,"sim:weight":0.174868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.167111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.165718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56591,"sim:weight":0.153567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This may activate local muscle stabilisers, multifidis and transversus abdominus (Akuthota and Nadler, 2004). FSE is utilised in neurological physiotherapy, however, there is no objective evidence regarding its effectiveness.  The evidence is also scant in relation to the effectiveness of exercise progressions from FSE in sitting.  \r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nHealthy volunteer subjects (mean (SD) age 46.45 years ±5.25 (n \u003d 22; 13 female) were recruited. Average normalised SEMG of bilateral Multifidis (M), Transverse abdominus/internal oblique (TA/IO), external oblique (EO), erector spinae (ES) was  obtained for baseline sitting, post intervention (FSE) and following the progressions of bilateral arm raise and  right leg lift. Local ethical approval was obtained.\r\n\r\nAnalysis:\r\nA paired t test (alpha ≤ 0.05) evaluated pre and post intervention muscle activity. A repeated measures ANOVA (alpha ≤ 0.05) evaluated muscle activity from the FSE (new baseline) to progressions 1 and 2. \r\n\r\nResults: \r\n\r\nResults for pre to post intervention show a statistically significant increase in muscle activity in all trunk muscles. Left M (p\u003d0.000), right M (p\u003d0.002), left ES (p\u003d0.029), right ES (p\u003d0.015), left TA/IO (p\u003d0.000), right TA/IO (p\u003d0.000), left EO (p\u003d0.008), right EO (p\u003d0.044). \r\n\r\nResults from FSE to bilateral arm raise showed a statistically significant increase in Left M (F\u003d79.02 p\u003d0.000), right M (p\u003d0.000), left ES (p\u003d0.000), right ES (p\u003d0.000). Values for the abdominal muscles were not significant, left TA/IO (p\u003d0.899), right TA/IO (p\u003d0.666), left EO (p\u003d0.131), right EO (p\u003d0.144).\r\n\r\nResults from FSE to right leg lift showed a statistically significant increase in Left M (p\u003d0.000), right M (p\u003d0.001), left TA (p\u003d0.000), right TA (p\u003d0.000), left EO (p\u003d0.000), right EO (p\u003d0.000). Results for ES were not significant, left ES (p\u003d0.174), right ES (p\u003d0.057). \r\n\r\nConclusions: \r\nThe results show that FSE activates local and global trunk stabilisers in sitting. During a bilateral arm raise (1) there is increased muscle activity in the stabilisers of the back but not the abdominals. With a unilateral leg lift (2) increases in all abdominals and bilateral Multifidis provide justification for its use as a progression. Limitations include the use of a small sample and healthy subjects. Future work should focus on patient populations.\r\n\r\nImplications:\r\nClinically, this study provides evidence for the use of FSE as a therapeutic intervention and of a right leg lift as an exercise progression. Justification of a bilateral arm raise is only evidenced if specific rehabilitation of back extensors is required.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Karen","Wray, Jonathan Marc","Price, Vonda Estelle","McBride, Mark Berrie","Donohoe, Joanne","Eddy , Suzanne"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.178664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5847038,"sim:weight":0.161053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75274,"sim:weight":0.147755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77770,"sim:weight":0.138605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.136668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56591,"sim:weight":0.135149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10910,"sim:weight":0.134073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.1269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.116041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.11199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222799,"sim:weight":0.109488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631989,"sim:weight":0.109036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.104377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26590,"sim:weight":0.101096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.0969871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75630,"sim:weight":0.0929963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632061,"sim:weight":0.0878131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24111,"sim:weight":0.0695096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The potential for P-gp to reduce drug absorption across lung epithelia is of significant interest; this is particularly so, given P-gp’s broad substrate specificity mediating efflux transport of a range of structurally unrelated substrates. Within lung, Pgp\r\nexpression is evident in bronchial and alveolar epithelia with functional characterisation of P-gp transport capacity within lung epithelial cells currently restricted to respective in-vitro cell culture models.\r\nThe aims of this project were to establish the relative mRNA expression of several ATP Binding Cassette (ABC), Solute Carrier (SLC) and Solute Carrier Organic Anion (SLCO) drug transporters within rat lung samples through use of RT-PCR; expression suggesting the potential to serve as targets for pulmonary drug delivery. Further, validation of an Isolated Perfused Rat Lung preparation for use in assessment of drug transport across the lung was conducted. In order to assess the functional significance of the ABC drug transporter, P-glycoprotein, on drugs instilled\r\nintra-tracheally to the IPRL set-up, use of the P-gp substrates; Rhodamine 123 (Rh123), digoxin, and\r\nflunisolide and the P-gp inhibitor, GF120918 was employed. Further, use of kinetic modelling was employed to establish pharmacokinetic parameters involved.\r\nUsing the IPRL, the P-gp dependent pulmonary absorption of the P-gp substrate, Rh123, was demonstrated. Dose-dependent absorption, consistent with a saturable component in the\r\nmolecule’s pulmonary absorption, was demonstrated. Further, the absorption of low dose Rh123 was promoted by the presence of the highly selective P-gp inhibitor GF120918, consistent with a functional role of P-gp mediated efflux within an intact lung; an efflux process which may limit the\r\npulmonary absorption of a lung administered molecule. Further studies using this system and extending the range of molecules studied will provide greater understanding of the quantitative significance of P-gp in limiting pulmonary absorption across lung epithelium.","bibo:AuthorList":["Francombe, Danielle"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76804,"sim:weight":0.140314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75928,"sim:weight":0.127865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.12267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75799,"sim:weight":0.122583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.118599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76202,"sim:weight":0.11738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643983,"sim:weight":0.116238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77174,"sim:weight":0.112723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76411,"sim:weight":0.110778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.107478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76003,"sim:weight":0.10509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75996,"sim:weight":0.100232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0974273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.0966357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631920,"sim:weight":0.074337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The non-embryophytes, with the largest biomass, include the fungal-like Prototaxites and associated mycelia, Pachytheca, and evidence for microbial biofilms.\r\nSeveral new dispersed palynomorph taxa are described, assemblages dominated by cryptospores. With additional published palynomorph and sedimentological data, broad\r\npalynofacies are constructed to reveal some information regarding lower Lochkovian habitats.\r\nUsing core data from this locality, lower strata are correlated to the Raglan Mudstone Formation, and a two-stage, ephemeral, mud-dominated, dryland river system is envisaged. The appearance of sandier, meandering channel deposits in upper strata are correlated to the St. Maughans Formation, which suggests either a change in fluvial morphology or the switching-on of trunk channels, the causes for which are discussed.\r\nBy combining palaeobotanical and sedimentological data, several plant taphofacies are recognised and a taphofacies model envisaged, the most significant taphonomic constraint on palaeoecological studies being the stratinomic partitioning of vegetation prior to burial by fluvial hydraulic sorting. Plant material is restricted to channel elements with low preservational potential, therefore the extent of phytoterrestrialisation and soil productivity\r\nmay have previously been underestimated. Indirect evidence for significant soil productivity, which may have increased chemical weathering, potentially altering atmospheric CO2\r\nlevels, is calculated from the stable carbon isotopic values of pedogenic carbonate nodules.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morris, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1448003,"sim:weight":0.218133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58425,"sim:weight":0.203072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76914,"sim:weight":0.19641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387121,"sim:weight":0.191521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108838,"sim:weight":0.191116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1153139,"sim:weight":0.187876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.172225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108973,"sim:weight":0.167673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108057,"sim:weight":0.157576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29443,"sim:weight":0.153497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55151,"sim:weight":0.148295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85198,"sim:weight":0.140204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108851,"sim:weight":0.130431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It observes that the historic problem of state-centralism continues to significantly contribute to environmental degradation in the Lake region, which has of late escalated to a level that requires urgent attention, if the already devastating consequences are to be mitigated and avoided in the future. It is particularly observed that while the issues of insufficient local participation and regional coordination standout prominently among the major underlying causes for resource degradation in the Region, the concept of multi-level government has not been given the attention that it deserves. \r\n\r\nOwing to its local importance and trans-boundary status, the Lake region requires concerted management involving the local, national and regional levels. Unfortunately, the synergy among those levels of government is still weak despite the tremendous opportunities offered by several recent developments, including a significant review of local government and various environmental laws. Also, despite its potential and achievements so far, the recently revived East African Community (EAC), whose mandate includes natural resources management, is yet to position itself as an effective supra-national institution. Much as the current legal and institutional frameworks tend to suggest an increasing level of engagement with other levels of government, this development tends to be drawn back by several inhibitions, both in design and at a practical level.  The thesis concludes that unless, the institutional structures for natural resources management are reviewed and strengthened in a manner that logically distributes powers and functions at the local, national and regional levels, the other positive measures so far in place are likely not to achieve their desired outcomes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nyende, Juma"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222885,"sim:weight":0.301284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.299307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10761,"sim:weight":0.28139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631263,"sim:weight":0.275321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.270567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.270239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108959,"sim:weight":0.256489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77201,"sim:weight":0.252942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643996,"sim:weight":0.250682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.234737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.234737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108611,"sim:weight":0.231018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222808,"sim:weight":0.207634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They have been applied to a wide range of industrial and scientific measurements, and used to study a diversity of physical phenomena. Recently, a number of challenging dynamic applications have been developed that require very high speed and high performance, such as kinetic inductance detectors and scanning microwave microscopes. Others, such as sensors for miniaturised fluidic systems and non-invasive blood glucose sensors, also require low system cost and small footprint. This thesis investigates new and improved techniques for implementing microwave resonant sensor systems, aiming to enhance their suitability for such demanding tasks. This was achieved through several original contributions: new insights into coupling, dynamics, and statistical properties of sensors; a hardware implementation of a realtime multitone readout system; and the development of efficient signal processing algorithms for the extraction of sensor measurements from resonator response data. The performance of this improved sensor system was verified through a number of novel measurements, achieving a higher sampling rate than the best available technology yet with equivalent accuracy and precision. At the same time, these experiments revealed unforeseen applications in liquid metrology and precision microwave heating of miniature flow systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Naylon, Alexander"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222802,"sim:weight":0.293749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76002,"sim:weight":0.236441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931560,"sim:weight":0.231646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.196935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77153,"sim:weight":0.19401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75763,"sim:weight":0.178779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53514,"sim:weight":0.174469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931857,"sim:weight":0.173379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56626,"sim:weight":0.172314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931258,"sim:weight":0.167749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24691,"sim:weight":0.164124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631516,"sim:weight":0.163817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.149678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57236,"sim:weight":0.147163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59004,"sim:weight":0.144259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.143019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.142867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651854,"sim:weight":0.14145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.140733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54114,"sim:weight":0.133625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the UK, tall perennial grass crops show potential as “biomass crops”, providing renewable energy sources with a low net carbon cost. However, conversion of large areas of farmland to biomass production would constitute a major land-use change with possible negative effects on native biodiversity, particularly as some biomass crop types are not native to the UK. The aim of this thesis was to assess biological diversity within mature (\u003e3 years old) crops of non-native Miscanthus x giganteus and native Phalaris arundinacea.\r\n\r\nBiomass crop structural characteristics and management regimes were recorded, and their biodiversity was surveyed with particular reference to birds and small mammals in comparison with adjacent land uses. Food resources in terms of non-crop vegetation and invertebrates were also recorded. \r\n\r\nLive-trapping revealed eight species of small mammal in the study crops, including a conservation priority species, the harvest mouse Micromys minutus, which was most abundant in Phalaris crops. Phalaris also contained the highest small mammal diversity, but the field headlands held the greatest small mammal abundance. Trapping and direct observations revealed a higher abundance and diversity of birds in the Miscanthus crops in comparison with Phalaris. Most of the bird species found in biomass crops were associated with woodland or reedbed rather than farmland habitat.\r\nPhalaris crops had a higher percentage of ground cover of the crop itself and non-crop vegetation, whereas Miscanthus fields had greater cover of crop litter. Miscanthus crops contained fewer invertebrates than Phalaris or the field headlands. Management specific to biomass grass crops involves harvest in spring, thus providing winter habitat of importance to birds and small mammals. The crop fields also provide a refuge for invertebrates and non-crop vegetation and overall, supported high levels of biodiversity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clapham, S.

Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) processing has been studied to differing degrees at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels in both humans and animals. Both levels of enquiry have their advantages, but attempts to combine the two approaches are still in their infancy. One mechanism that is possibly involved in determining the reponse properties of neurons that are involved in sensory discrimination is inhibition by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Several studies have shown that inhibition is an important mechanism to “tune” the response of neurons. Recently it has become possible to measure the concentration of GABA in vivo using edited Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), whereas magnetoencephalography (MEG) offers the possibility to look at changes in neuromagnetic activation with millisecond accuracy. With these methods we aimed to establish whether in vivo non-invasive neuroimaging can elucidate the underlying neuronal mechanisms of human tactile behaviour and to determine how such findings can be integrated with what is currently known from invasive methods. Edited GABA-MRS has shown that individual GABA concentration in S1 correlates strongly with tactile frequency discrimination. MEG was used to investigate the neuromagnetic correlates of a frequency discrimination paradigm in which we induced adaptation to a 25 Hz frequency. We showed that S1 is driven by the adapting stimulus and shows that neural rhythms are modulated as a result of adaptation. This is the first time that behavioural psychophysics of tactile adaptation has been investigated using complimentary neuroimaging methods. We combined different methods to complement both physiological and behavioural studies of tactile processing in S1 to investigate the factors involved in the neural dynamics of tactile processing and we show that non-invasive studies on humans can be used to understand physiological underpinnings of somatosensory processing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Puts, Nicolaas"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Focus group results about family centred care.","bibo:abstract":"Purpose: Research question: ‘How ‘Family- Centred’ do staff and parents perceive their work with disabled children and young people?’  \r\nObjectives: 1. To determine staff self-evaluation of family-centred care by completing the questionnaire MPOC-SP. \r\n2.  To explore staff views on their own family-centred care through discussion in a focus group, using the themes from the MPOC-SP.  \r\n3. To explore parental views of family-centred provision for their disabled child by interview individually or in a focus group. \r\n4. To identify any areas where further staff training to improve their family-centred service provision.\r\n\r\nRelevance: Physiotherapists working with children do not work in isolation and are a valuable part of the interdisciplinary team. Achieving high standards of health care provision with children with a disability requires a focus on Family Centred Care. Family Centred Care has been defined as a philosophy of care where families are supported in their decision-making roles in an equal partnership with professionals. \r\nParticipants: Purposive non-random sampling was used to recruit study participants. Staff were approached by letter and invited to take part in a focus group in their area. These staff then gave out information letters to parents whose child was receiving a service. Twenty nine staff and 10 parents volunteered. \r\nMethods: This study utilized a mixed methodology. The Measure of the Processes of Care for Service Providers (MPOC-SP) is a sensitive, valid and reliable questionnaire. Quantitative data was gathered from administration of this questionnaire with staff. A series of interviews and focus groups based around the themes from the questionnaire were also conducted with staff and parents of disabled children. These were recorded with a Dictaphone and transcribed verbatim.\r\nAnalysis: The questionnaire data were analyzed with SPSS 16. The questionnaire is scored from 1-7 with 1 being the lowest 7 the highest score staff could award themselves based on their own perception of their performance. Interview and focus group data were analyzed using an editing approach. \r\nResults: The mean of ‘interpersonal sensitivity’ was 5.35 and ‘respect’ 5.74 compared to ‘providing general information’ 4.34 and ‘communicating’ 4.96, being slightly lower in staff self perception.  Staff commented on the value of the questionnaire as a self- reflective tool. \r\nStaff described how they adapted their service to meet parental needs and empowered and enabled parents despite. Parent’s spoke highly of staff input and described the attributes they most valued. Some parental feedback suggested that there needed to be a clearer complaints procedure. \r\nConclusions: This was a pilot study and the results should be treated with caution. The MPOC-SP has value for practitioners as a self reflective tool. The majority of parents considered they were treated as equal partners in the decision making processes and this should continue. To increase our understanding of Family Centred Care this topic could be explored by a closer ethnographic study in this context.  \r\nImplications: Physiotherapists working with families with children with a disability need to evaluate their practice in terms of family centred care. Investigation of the influence of focused Family Centred Care training on parental experiences is warranted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pickering, Dawn","Busse-Morris, Monica"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1632042,"sim:weight":0.397661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.383781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.338554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.318295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":294473,"sim:weight":0.31464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.306388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.302736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631825,"sim:weight":0.301485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76136,"sim:weight":0.297564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266223,"sim:weight":0.295335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780040,"sim:weight":0.292019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.273261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.263674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.263212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77721,"sim:weight":0.25901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.253879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) crotoxin, an antitumor protein that appears to act by interaction with epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), has recently shown activity in breast cancer in phase I clinical trials, it also displayed nonspecific neurotoxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to apply a novel concept called polymer-masked-unmasked- protein therapy (PUMPT) to give a bioresponsive dextrin-PLA2 conjugate that would reduce PLA2 systemic toxicity but retain antitumor activity following α-amylase triggered degradation of dextrin in the tumor interstitium. Dextrin (Mw ∼ 60000 g/mol; ∼22 mol % succinoylation) and PLA2 (from honey bee venom) were chosen as models for these initial studies, and the conjugates synthesized contained 6.1 wt % PLA2, with \u003c1% free enzyme. The conjugate showed decreased (∼36%) enzyme activity compared to native PLA2, but activity was restored to ∼100% following ncubation with α-amylase. Whereas dextrin conjugation caused a marked reduction in PLA2\u0027s hemolytic activity, the conjugate was cytotoxic toward MCF-7, HT29, and B16F10 cells at a level that was comparable to, or greater than, that seen for free PLA2. In these cell lines, cytotoxicity showed partial correlation with the level of EGFR expression.

Design Experimental study and time series analysis of a prototype community partnership between the health service, police, and local government partners designed to prevent violence. Setting Cardiff, Wales, and 14 comparison cities designated \"most similar\" by the Home Office in England and Wales. Intervention After a 33 month development period, anonymised data relevant to violence prevention (precise violence location, time, days, and weapons) from patients attending emergency departments in Cardiff and reporting injury from violence were shared over 51 months with police and local authority partners and used to target resources for violence prevention. Main outcome measures Health service records of hospital admissions related to violence and police records of woundings and less serious assaults in Cardiff and other cities after adjustment for potential confounders. Results Information sharing and use were associated with a substantial and significant reduction in hospital admissions related to violence. In the intervention city (Cardiff) rates fell from seven to five a month per 100 000 population compared with an increase from five to eight in comparison cities (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.69). Average rate of woundings recorded by the police changed from 54 to 82 a month per 100 000 population in Cardiff compared with an increase from 54 to 114 in comparison cities (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.68, 0.61 to 0.75). There was a significant increase in less serious assaults recorded by the police, from 15 to 20 a month per 100 000 population in Cardiff compared with a decrease from 42 to 33 in comparison cities (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.38, 1.13 to 1.70). Conclusion An information sharing partnership between health services, police, and local government in Cardiff, Wales, altered policing and other strategies to prevent violence based on information collected from patients treated in emergency departments after injury sustained in violence. This intervention led to a significant reduction in violent injury and was associated with an increase in police recording of minor assaults in Cardiff compared with similar cities in England and Wales where this intervention was not implemented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Florence, C.","Shepherd, Jonathan","Brennan, Iain","Simon, T."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1136/bmj.d3313","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84892,"sim:weight":0.389608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222638,"sim:weight":0.336647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.30388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222980,"sim:weight":0.298551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795345,"sim:weight":0.288076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76995,"sim:weight":0.288035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54165,"sim:weight":0.26947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52375,"sim:weight":0.265606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52423,"sim:weight":0.257735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104174,"sim:weight":0.251959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52391,"sim:weight":0.25151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52432,"sim:weight":0.217024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929826,"sim:weight":0.194927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.18046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51960,"sim:weight":0.164406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65257,"sim:weight":0.134631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the present study, an in vitro model of chronic wound biofilms was developed to assess the efficacy of antimicrobial treatments for use in the wound environment. Using chronic wound isolates, assays of bacterial coaggregation established that aerobic and anaerobic wound bacteria were able to coaggregate and form biofilms. A constant depth film fermenter (CDFF) was used to develop wound biofilms in vitro, which were analysed using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The susceptibility of bacteria within these biofilms was examined in response to the most frequently prescribed \u0027chronic wound\u0027 antibiotics and a series of iodine- and silver-containing commercial antimicrobial products and lactoferrin. Defined biofilms were rapidly established within 1-2 days. Antibiotic treatment demonstrated that mixed Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus biofilms were not affected by ciprofloxacin (5 mg/L) or flucloxacillin (15 mg/L), even at concentrations equivalent to twice the observed peak serum levels. The results contrasted with the ability of povidone-iodine (1%) to disrupt the wound biofilm; an effect that was particularly pronounced in the dressing testing where iodine-based dressings completely disrupted established 7 day biofilms. In contrast, only two of six silver-containing dressings exhibited any effect on 3 day biofilms, with no effect on 7 day biofilms. This wound model emphasizes the potential role of the biofilm phenotype in the observed resistance to antibiotic therapies that may occur in chronic wounds in vivo.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hill, Katja E.","Malic, Sladjana","McKee, R.","Rennison, T.","Harding, Keith Gordon","Williams, David Wynne","Thomas, David William"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1093/jac","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":51739,"sim:weight":0.43287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104628,"sim:weight":0.391272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24735,"sim:weight":0.33639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104112,"sim:weight":0.318465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999036,"sim:weight":0.309137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5839025,"sim:weight":0.281544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104114,"sim:weight":0.273727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77276,"sim:weight":0.238622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24401,"sim:weight":0.203907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104849,"sim:weight":0.187463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930803,"sim:weight":0.148415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76816,"sim:weight":0.112544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75818,"sim:weight":0.106733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76202,"sim:weight":0.0826892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631076,"sim:weight":0.0803989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222853,"sim:weight":0.0790033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There have been many randomized controlled trials of screening and brief alcohol intervention in primary care. Most trials have reported positive effects of brief intervention, in terms of reduced alcohol consumption in excessive drinkers. Despite this considerable evidence-base, key questions remain unanswered including: the applicability of the evidence to routine practice; the most efficient strategy for screening patients; and the required intensity of brief intervention in primary care. This pragmatic factorial trial, with cluster randomization of practices, will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different models of screening to identify hazardous and harmful drinkers in primary care and different intensities of brief intervention to reduce excessive drinking in primary care patients. Methods and design. GPs and nurses from 24 practices across the North East (n \u003d 12), London and South East (n \u003d 12) of England will be recruited. Practices will be randomly allocated to one of three intervention conditions: a leaflet-only control group (n \u003d 8); brief structured advice (n \u003d 8); and brief lifestyle counselling (n \u003d 8). To test the relative effectiveness of different screening methods all practices will also be randomised to either a universal or targeted screening approach and to use either a modified single item (M-SASQ) or FAST screening tool. Screening randomisation will incorporate stratification by geographical area and intervention condition. During the intervention stage of the trial, practices in each of the three arms will recruit at least 31 hazardous or harmful drinkers who will receive a short baseline assessment followed by brief intervention. Thus there will be a minimum of 744 patients recruited into the trial. Discussion. The trial will evaluate the impact of screening and brief alcohol intervention in routine practice; thus its findings will be highly relevant to clinicians working in primary care in the UK. There will be an intention to treat analysis of study outcomes at 6 and 12 months after intervention. Analyses will include patient measures (screening result, weekly alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, public service use and quality of life) and implementation measures from practice staff (the acceptability and feasibility of different models of brief intervention.)

Although TRIM32 is involved in protein ubiquitination, its substrates and the molecular consequences of disease-causing mutations are poorly understood. In this paper, we show that TRIM32 is a widely expressed ubiquitin ligase that is localized to the Z-line in skeletal muscle. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that TRIM32 binds and ubiquitinates dysbindin, a protein implicated in the genetic aetiology of schizophrenia, augmenting its degradation. Small-interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of TRIM32 in myoblasts resulted in elevated levels of dysbindin. Importantly, the LGMD2H/STM-associated TRIM32 mutations, D487N and R394H impair ubiquitin ligase activity towards dysbindin and were mislocalized in heterologous cells. These mutants were able to self-associate and also co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type TRIM32 in transfected cells. Furthermore, the D487N mutant could bind to both dysbindin and its E2 enzyme but was defective in monoubiquitination.

However, only few of these parameters have physical meanings and can be experimentally determined. In this paper, a parametric study of a Hill-type hyperelastic skeletal muscle model is performed. First, the Hill-type hyperelastic skeletal muscle model is formulated, containing 13 material parameters. The values or value ranges of these parameters are discussed. The muscle model is then used to predict the behaviour of New Zealand white rabbit hind leg muscle tibialis anterior and a sensitivity study of several parameters is performed. Results show that some parameters in the muscle model can be experimentally determined, some parameters have their own value ranges and the muscle model can predict the experimental data by tuning the parameters within their value ranges. The results from the sensitivity study can help understand how some parameters influence the total muscle stress.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lu, Y.

Objective: To describe the research design for an exploratory trial examining the feasibility and acceptability of a premises-level intervention designed to reduce severe intoxication and related disorder. The study also aims to assess the feasibility of a potential future large scale effectiveness trial and provide information on key trial design parameters including inclusion criteria, premises recruitment methods, strategies to implement the intervention and trial design, outcome measures, data collection methods and intra-cluster correlations. Design: A randomised controlled trial in licensed premises that had experienced at least one assault in the year preceding the intervention, documented in police or hospital Emergency Department (ED) records. Premises were recruited from four study areas by piloting four recruitment strategies of varying intensity. Thirty two licensed premises were grouped into matched pairs to reduce potential bias and randomly allocated to the control or intervention condition. The study included a nested process evaluation to provide information on intervention acceptability and implementation. Outcome measures included police-recorded violent incidents, assault-related attendances at each premises\u0027 local ED and patron Breath Alcohol Concentration assessed on exiting and entering study premises. Results: The most successful recruitment method involved local police licensing officers and yielded a 100% success rate. Police-records of violence provided the most appropriate source of data about disorder at the premises level. Conclusion: The methodology of an exploratory trial is presented and despite challenges presented by the study environment it is argued an exploratory trial is warranted. Initial investigations in recruitment methods suggest that study premises should be recruited with the assistance of police officers. Police data were of sufficient quality to identify disorder and street surveys are a feasible method for measuring intoxication at the individual level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, Simon Christopher","Brennan, Iain Richard","Murphy, Simon","Byrne, Eleanor","Moore, Susan N.","Shepherd, Jonathan Paul","Moore, Laurence Anthony Russell"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1186/1471-2458-10-607","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52432,"sim:weight":0.433797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104174,"sim:weight":0.374929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52391,"sim:weight":0.36418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52423,"sim:weight":0.309996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.256479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54165,"sim:weight":0.244416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.239878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.193076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.18339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795345,"sim:weight":0.168749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.153348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84894,"sim:weight":0.14145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51960,"sim:weight":0.137421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.115945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, although alcohol misuse is common amongst offenders, there is limited evidence of alcohol brief interventions in the criminal justice field. This factorial pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial with Offender Managers (OMs) as the unit of randomisation will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different models of screening to identify hazardous and harmful drinkers in probation and different intensities of brief intervention to reduce excessive drinking in probation clients. Methods and design: Ninety-six OMs from 9 probation areas across 3 English regions (the North East Region (n \u003d 4) and London and the South East Regions (n \u003d 5)) will be recruited. OMs will be randomly allocated to one of three intervention conditions: a client information leaflet control condition (n \u003d 32 OMs); 5-minute simple structured advice (n \u003d 32 OMs) and 20-minute brief lifestyle counselling delivered by an Alcohol Health Worker (n \u003d 32 OMs). Randomisation will be stratified by probation area. To test the relative effectiveness of different screening methods all OMs will be randomised to either the Modified Single Item Screening Questionnaire (M-SASQ) or the Fast Alcohol Screening Test (FAST). There will be a minimum of 480 clients recruited into the trial. There will be an intention to treat analysis of study outcomes at 6 and 12 months post intervention. Analysis will include client measures (screening result, weekly alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, re-offending, public service use and quality of life) and implementation measures from OMs (the extent of screening and brief intervention beyond the minimum recruitment threshold will provide data on acceptability and feasibility of different models of brief intervention). We will also examine the practitioner and organisational factors associated with successful implementation. Discussion. The trial will evaluate the impact of screening and brief alcohol intervention in routine probation work and therefore its findings will be highly relevant to probation teams and thus the criminal justice system in the UK. © 2009 Newbury-Birch et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","bibo:AuthorList":["Newbury-Birch, D.","Bland, M.","Cassidy, P.","Coulton, S.","Deluca, P.","Drummond, C.","Gilvarry, E.","Godfrey, C.","Heather, N.","Kaner, E.","Myles, J.","Oyefeso, A.","Parrott, S.","Perryman, K.","Phillips, T.","Shenker, D.","Shepherd, Jonathan Paul"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1186/1471-2458-9-418","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":10019,"sim:weight":0.379494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100485,"sim:weight":0.317141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10062,"sim:weight":0.30852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.26094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631755,"sim:weight":0.240361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8337,"sim:weight":0.22429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.220104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66882,"sim:weight":0.211643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75528,"sim:weight":0.184926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108554,"sim:weight":0.169191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54387,"sim:weight":0.168235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77481,"sim:weight":0.159006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76464,"sim:weight":0.142061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76708,"sim:weight":0.124327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The debate concerning where best to manage newly diagnosed children continues. Some units routinely admit children to hospital whilst others routinely manage children at home. A Cochrane review identified the need for a large well-designed randomised controlled trial to investigate any significant differences in comprehensive short and long-term outcomes between the two approaches. The DECIDE study will address these knowledge gaps, providing high quality evidence to inform national and international policy and practice.Methods/Design: This is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial across eight UK paediatric diabetes centres. The study aims to recruit 240 children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and their parents/carers. Eligible patients (aged 0-17 years) will be remotely randomised to either \u0027hospital\u0027 or \u0027home\u0027 management. Parents/carers of patients will also be recruited. Nursing management of participants and data collection will be co-ordinated by a project nurse at each centre. Data will be collected for 24 months after diagnosis; at follow up appointments at 3, 12 and 24 months and every 3-4 months at routine clinic visits.The primary outcome measure is patients\u0027 glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 24 months after diagnosis. Additional measurements of HbA1c will be made at diagnosis and 3 and 12 months later. HbA1c concentrations will be analysed at a central laboratory.Secondary outcome measures include length of stay at diagnosis, growth, adverse events, quality of life, anxiety, coping with diabetes, diabetes knowledge, home/clinic visits, self-care activity, satisfaction and time off school/work. Questionnaires will be sent to participants at 1, 12 and 24 months and will include a questionnaire, developed and validated to measure impact of the diagnosis on social activity and independence. Additional qualitative outcome measures include the experience of both approaches by a subgroup of participants (n \u003d 30) and health professionals. Total health service costs will be evaluated. A cost effectiveness analysis will assess direct and indirect health service costs against the primary outcome (HbA1c).Discussion: This will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate hospital and home management of children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and the findings should provide important evidence to inform practice and national guidelines.

Unfortunately the\r\nmeasurement systems required to characterize the microwave devices and\r\ncircuits have not kept pace with the emerging telecommunication\r\ntechnologies demands. This has resulted into a situation where either the\r\ncircuits being employed in the components are unoptimized or the yield and\r\nturn-around of optimized circuits are slow. One of the contributing factors of\r\nsuch situations is the limitations of the existing measurement systems to\r\nscale up in performance to fulfil the necessary requirements. This thesis\r\npresents an enhanced multi-tone, time domain waveform measurement and\r\nengineering system. The presented system allows for a more considered,\r\nand scientific process to be adopted in the characterisation and\r\nmeasurement of microwave power devices for modern day communications\r\nsystems. The main contributions to the field of research come in two areas;\r\nfirstly developments that allow for accurate time domain measurement of\r\ncomplex modulated signals using commercially available equipment; and\r\nsecondly in the area of active impedance control, where significant\r\ndevelopments were made allowing active control of impedance across a\r\nmodulated bandwidth.\r\nThe first research area addressed is the fundamental difficulty in sampling\r\nmulti-tone waveforms, where the main achievements have been the\r\nrealisation of a high quality trigger clock for the sampling oscilloscope and a\r\n“Time Domain Partitioning” approach to measure and average multi-tone\r\nwaveforms on-board. This approach allows the efficient collection of high\r\nquality vectoral information for all significant distortion terms, for all bands of\r\ninterest.\r\nThe second area of research investigated suitable impedance control\r\narchitectures to comprehensively investigate out-of-band impedance effects\r\non the linearity performance of a device. The ultimate aim was to\r\nsimultaneously present independent, baseband impedances to all the\r\nsignificant baseband (IF) frequency components and to 2nd harmonic that\r\nresult from a multi-tone excitation. The main achievement in this area was\r\nthe ability of the enhanced measurement system to present the broadband\r\nimpedance. At baseband this has been achieved in the time domain using a\r\nsingle arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) to synthesise the necessary\r\nwaveforms to allow a specific IF impedance environment to be maintained\r\nacross a wide IF bandwidth.

Telephone interviews and review of optometric and hospital notes were used to determine management appropriateness for patients either managed in optometric practice or referred to the Hospital Eye Service (HES). A Geographic Information Systems analysis determined distances travelled to the optometrist. A cost analysis was used to determine the net cost of the schemes. \r\n\r\nResults: 4243 (66%) of the 6432 individuals were managed in optometric practice; inappropriate management was apparent in 1% of individuals. 392 hospital notes were reviewed; 75% exhibited appropriate optometric referrals to the HES. 87% of individuals travelled less than 5 miles to attend an optometrist. The net cost of a PEARS/WEHE consultation was a minimum of £12. \r\n\r\nConclusions: Optometric management within the schemes is acceptable. Good equity of access was achieved at a relatively low net cost per consultation.

Differ- ent to traditional online social applications, micro-blogs are lightweight, require small cognitive effort and help share real-time information about personal activities and interests. In this article we explore scalable pushing protocols that are particularly suited to the delivery of this type of service in a mobile pervasive environment. Here, micro-blog updates are generated and carried by mobile (smart-phone type) devices and are exchanged through opportunistic encounters. We enhance primitive push mechanisms using social information concerning the interests of network nodes as well as the frequency of encounters with them. This information is collected and shared dynamically, as nodes initially encounter each other and exchange their preferences, and directs the forwarding of micro-blog updates across the network. Also incorporated is the spatiotemporal scope of the updates, which is only partially considered in current Internet services.\r\nWe introduce several new protocol variants that differentiate the forwarding strategy towards interest- similar and frequently encountered nodes, as well as the amount of updates forwarded upon each encounter. In all cases, the proposed scheme outperforms the basic flooding dissemination mechanism in delivering high numbers of micro-blog updates to the nodes interested in them. Our extensive evaluation highlights how use can be made of different amounts of social information to trade performance with complexity and computational effort. However, hard performance bounds appear to be set by the level of coincidence between interest-similar node communities and meeting groups emerging due to the mobility patterns of the nodes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allen, Stuart","Chorley, Martin","Colombo, Gualtiero","Jaho, Eva","Karaliopoulos, Merkouris","Stavrakakis, Ioannis","Whitaker, Roger"],"dc:date":"2012","doi":"10.1016/j.pmcj.2011.12.003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1549530,"sim:weight":0.320047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26670,"sim:weight":0.295596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645863,"sim:weight":0.291337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.277409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.251225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.235452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.231048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70126,"sim:weight":0.230432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.229021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.222423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931258,"sim:weight":0.219013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.201844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1549556,"sim:weight":0.199687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.188653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.176102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70175,"sim:weight":0.157179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Overlapping clones were isolated from a human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell cDNA library spanning a total of 5,200 bp. A second set of clones contained an alternative 3\u0027 end sequence giving a total of 4,316 bp. The longer sequence contained an open reading frame for a 1,193-residue-long polypeptide. The alternative sequence was shortened at the carboxyl-terminal end coding for a 1,111-residue-long polypeptide. The amino acid sequence contained 21 amino acids of a putative signal peptide and 1,172 residues or alternatively 1,090 residues of a sequence with five distinct domains homologous to domains I-V in laminin chains. Comparison of the amino acid sequences showed that the novel laminin chain is homologous to the laminin B2 chain. However, the structure of the novel laminin chain isolated here differs significantly from that of the B2 chain in that it has no domain VI and domains V, IV, and III are shorter, resulting in a truncated laminin chain. The alternative sequence had a shortened domain I/II. In accordance with the current nomenclature, the chain characterized here is termed B2t. Calculation of possible chain interactions of laminin chains with the B2t chain domain I/II indicated that the B2t chain can replace the B2 chain in some laminin molecules. The gene for the laminin B2t chain (LAMB2T) was localized to chromosome 1q25-q31 in close proximity to the laminin B2 chain gene. Northern analysis showed that the B2t chain is expressed in several human fetal tissues but differently from the laminin B1 and B2 chains. By in situ hybridization expression of the B2t chain was localized to specific epithelial cells in skin, lung, and kidney as opposed to a general epithelial and endothelial cell expression of the laminin B2 chain in the same tissues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kallunki, P.","Sainio, K.","Eddy, R.","Byers, M.","Kallunki, T.","Sariola, H.","Beck, Konrad","Hirvonen, H.","Shows, T.

The Association is a democratically structured, voluntary organisation with a history of providing adult education in communities throughout south Wales for more than a hundred years. Its reliance on funding from the Welsh Government for the majority of its income is a significant aspect of the background to this study, particularly as one of the Association’s aims is the provision of courses that ‘will assist in the promotion of active citizenship’. The research is set within the contexts of changes in adult education policy during the Association’s lifetime and a contemporary emphasis on the economic purpose of education, the contested nature of the concepts of citizenship and active citizenship and the organisation’s historic role in relation to the Labour movement and past tensions in respect of the receipt of state funding. The study explores through semi-structured interviews with those responsible for the Association’s strategic direction, both senior staff and Trustees, as well those whose role is to implement policy as Development Workers and Part-time Tutors, how active citizenship is understood and whether or not there is a shared understanding within the Association. A picture emerges in which there appears to be uncertainty among a significant proportion of participants about the Association’s purpose as well as a lack of a shared understanding of what active citizenship means and of the kinds of active citizenship the Association could promote. The study also reveals shortcomings in organisational capacity to achieve the aim of promoting active citizenship. The thesis concludes with a series of policy recommendations for the Association to consider.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gass, Jeremy"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":55754,"sim:weight":0.330338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.276106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.266967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.266967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.208285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631763,"sim:weight":0.203235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.195102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77237,"sim:weight":0.162192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Krasopoulos et al accepted evidence from the authors of 20 reports of randomised aspirin trials of an inhibition of the expected platelet response to aspirin, however measured. The platelet tests had been done in hospital before the patients were admitted to the trials. The authors therefore dismiss the possibility that the lack of benefit during the trial was simply due to poor compliance with aspirin taking.\r\n\r\nCompliance could still partly explain the findings. In one study only one of the 17 patients who had been judged to be aspirin resistant failed to show the expected platelet response to aspirin when aspirin was taken under close supervision.2\r\n\r\nParadoxically, although platelet aggregation showed a large range in men in a large cohort, there was no evidence that the degree of platelet aggregation is predictive of subsequent heart disease events.3 4\r\n\r\nThe authors’ estimate of the beneficial effect of aspirin in sensitive patients is remarkably close to the 51% reduction reported for the doctors in the US physicians health study who claimed that they had taken aspirin regularly, compared with a 17% reduction in those who admitted that they had taken the drug on less than half the days.5\r\n\r\nThe application of the term increased risk to the patients with aspirin resistance (at the foot of fig 3) is unfortunate.

Recently, we have shown a further capacity for IRS-1 to associate with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/erbB1), with activation of EGFR promoting recruitment and phosphorylation of IRS-1 in an oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell line. In this study, we examined recruitment of IRS-1 by another member of the erbB receptor family, erbB3, in three ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. Our studies revealed an interaction between erbB3 and IRS-1 in MCF-7, T47D and BT474 cells with HRGβ1 treatment significantly enhancing this recruitment and promoting IRS-1 phosphorylation at tyrosine (Y) 612, a specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) binding site. IRS-1 appears to play a key role in erbB3 signalling in MCF-7 and T47D cells as its knockdown using siRNA greatly impaired HRGβ1 signalling via PI3K/AKT in these cell lines. This novel interaction may have clinical relevance as immunohistochemical analysis of ER-positive breast cancer patient samples revealed IRS-1 Y612 expression positively correlated with total erbB3, p-AKT and Ki67 expression. Importantly, we found that recruitment of IRS-1 by erbB3 impaired IRS-1 recruitment by IGF-IR in both MCF-7 and T47D cells, whilst blockade of IGF-1R enhanced erbB3/IRS-1 interaction and sensitised both cell lines to HRGβ1. Consequently, blockade of erbB3 signalling enhanced the effects of IGF-IR inhibition in these cells. In conclusion, these and previous findings suggest that IRS-1 can be recruited to IGF-1R, EGFR and erbB3 in ER-positive breast cancer cells and this may provide an adaptive resistance mechanism when these receptors are targeted individually. Consequently co-targeting of IGF-IR and erbB receptors may prove to be a more effective strategy for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Knowlden, Janice Mary","Gee, Julia Margaret Wendy","Barrow, Denise","Robertson, J.

More recently, another member of the erbB receptor family, erbB3, has been implicated in antihormone resistance in breast cancer. In the present study we have investigated whether induction of erbB3, and related family member erbB4, may provide an alternative resistance mechanism to antihormonal action in a panel of four ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. MCF-7, T47D, BT474 and MDAMB361 cell lines were exposed to fulvestrant (100 nM) for 7 days, and effects on erbB3/4 signalling and growth were assessed. Effects of the erbB3/4 ligand heregulin-β1 were also examined in the absence and presence of fulvestrant. Fulvestrant potently reduced ER expression and transcriptional activity and significantly inhibited growth in all four cell lines. However, alongside this inhibitory activity, fulvestrant also consistently induced protein expression and activity of erbB4 in the four cell lines and also promoted erbB3, erbB2 and EGFR protein expression and activity in MCF-7 and T47D cells. Consequently, fulvestrant treatment sensitised each cell line to the actions of heregulin-β1 with enhanced erbB3/4-driven signalling activity and significant increases in cell proliferation being observed when compared with untreated cells. Indeed, in T47D and MDAMB361, heregulin-β1 was converted from a ligand having negligible or suppressive growth activity into one that potently promoted cell proliferation. Consequently, fulvestrant-induced growth inhibition was completely overridden by heregulin-β1 in all four cell lines. In conclusion, these findings would suggest that although antihormones, such as fulvestrant, may have potent acute growth inhibitory activity in ER-positive breast cancer cells, their ability to induce and sensitize cells to growth factors, such as heregulins, may serve to reduce and ultimately limit their inhibitory activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hutcheson, Iain Robert","Goddard, Lindy","Gee, Julia Margaret Wendy","Barrow, Denise","Nicholson, Robert Ian"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1186/bcr2510","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222812,"sim:weight":0.298444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931557,"sim:weight":0.296875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.220551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75980,"sim:weight":0.209896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397443,"sim:weight":0.203295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76804,"sim:weight":0.200208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31045,"sim:weight":0.198494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631809,"sim:weight":0.197962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76866,"sim:weight":0.183507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222792,"sim:weight":0.168038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631544,"sim:weight":0.138923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631954,"sim:weight":0.137128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.130853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76609,"sim:weight":0.118119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631653,"sim:weight":0.098518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Altered levels of PTTG1, GFRα3, or their associated family members were observed in further endocrine resistant states, including an additional faslodex resistant model that has progressed to a highly-aggressive state (FasR-Lt) and XMCF-7 cells resistant to oestrogen deprivation. PTTG1 and GFRα3 induction were also implicated in limiting response to anti-EGFR agents currently in breast cancer trials, with GFRα3 ligand (artemin) largely overcoming drug response. mRNA studies in clinical disease revealed PTTG1 associated with lymph node spread, high tumour grade and proliferation, while GFRα3 was enriched in ER-negative tumours and those expressing EGFR, profiles implying roles in clinical resistance and aggressive tumour behaviour.

In this study, we examined whether IRS-1 also associates with another erbB receptor family member, erbB3, and what impact this might have on IGF-IR signalling in three ER+ breast cancer cell lines. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nImmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were utilised to examine the potential association between erbB3 and IRS-1 in MCF-7, T47D and BT-474 cells in the absence and presence of the erbB3/4 ligand heregulin β1 (HRGβ1). Subsequently, the impact of a selective IGF-IR/IR inhibitor 4-anilino-5-bromo-2-[4-(2-hydroxy-3-(N, N-dimethylamino)propoxy)anilino]pyrimidine on this association and HRGβ1 signalling was assessed in these cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis of a small cohort of ER+ breast cancer patient samples was also performed to determine the potential clinical relevance of this novel interaction. \r\n\r\nResults\r\nImmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis revealed an interaction between erbB3 and IRS-1 in MCF-7, T47D and BT-474 cells, with HRGβ1 significantly enhancing this recruitment and promoting IRS-1 phosphorylation at Y612. IRS-1 participates in erbB3 signalling in MCF-7 and T47D cells as IRS-1 knockdown impaired HRGβ1 signalling. Importantly, recruitment of IRS-1 by erbB3 reduced IRS-1 association with IGF-IR in MCF-7 and T47D cells, whilst blockade of IGF-IR-enhanced erbB3-IRS-1 interaction and sensitised both cell lines to HRGβ1, allowing HRGβ1 to override IGF-IR blockade. Consequently, suppression of IRS-1 signalling enhanced the effects of IGF-IR inhibition in these cells. This novel interaction may have clinical relevance, as immunohistochemical analysis of a small ER+ breast tumour series revealed significant positive correlations between phosphorylated IRS-1 Y612 expression and total erbB3, phosphorylated Akt and Ki-67 expression. \r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nIRS-1 can be recruited to IGF-IR and erbB3 in ER+ breast cancer cells, and this provides an adaptive resistance mechanism when these receptors are targeted individually. Consequently, cotargeting IGF-IR and either erbB3 or IRS-1 should prove to be a more effective strategy for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Knowlden, Janice Mary","Gee, Julia Margaret Wendy","Barrow, Denise","Robertson, John F.","Ellis, Ian O.","Nicholson, Robert Ian","Hutcheson, Iain Robert"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1186/bcr3018","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222812,"sim:weight":0.239122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931557,"sim:weight":0.223044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397434,"sim:weight":0.179489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75804,"sim:weight":0.151984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397431,"sim:weight":0.151556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631715,"sim:weight":0.14762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76612,"sim:weight":0.145821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631895,"sim:weight":0.129266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76062,"sim:weight":0.125138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76325,"sim:weight":0.120673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222792,"sim:weight":0.117489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76961,"sim:weight":0.11682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76866,"sim:weight":0.111076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76122,"sim:weight":0.110438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632033,"sim:weight":0.102906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222903,"sim:weight":0.094032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.0901397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76646,"sim:weight":0.0898882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75588,"sim:weight":0.083771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0795651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Adult Family Placements are provided by individuals or families in the local community, who share their homes and their lives with people with learning disabilities who need support to live more independent lives.  In recent years there has been growing interest in the provision of family-based schemes (McConkey, McConaghie, Roberts \u0026 King 2002), and such schemes are now widely used for the provision of long term residential care for people with learning disabilities in Britain (Dagnan, 1997).While a limited amount of research has focussed on the characteristics of providers of Adult Family Placements (Gage, 1995; McConkey et al., 2005), and some has focussed on the recruitment and retention of such providers (Bernard, 2004; Hanrahan, 2006), very little research has focussed on the reasons  behind why people become providers of such placements (McConkey et al., 2005). The aim of the present study was to use qualitative methodology to explore the experiences of five individuals who provide Adult Family Placements for individuals with a learning disability. Information was gathered using semi-structured interviews and verbatim transcripts were then analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, 2004).   From the analysis, five superordinate themes emerged, each with their corresponding master themes.

Current methods to understand how epidemic diseases transmit are often confounded by heterogeneity in infection rates amongst host populations. Endemic parasites, which are often less severe compared to epidemic diseases, may contribute to that variation by impacting on host biology and therefore altering the transmission of epidemic diseases. \r\n\r\nThe effects of an endemic, gastrointestinal infection on host fitness and host interactions with an epidemic parasite were explored in a novel invertebrate system developed for this study. The chosen host was the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, which was infected with an endemic protozoan parasite, Gregarina blattarum alone or in co-infection with an entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae, which causes epidemic outbreaks in host populations. \r\n\r\nThere was evidence of density dependent regulation by the endemic parasite. Reductions in both host survival and fecundity during endemic infection both contributed to this regulation. The endemic parasite also had fitness costs for offspring from infected parents, who took longer to reach adulthood and were less likely to survive. Protozoan infected host populations had lower densities and showed less variance in population fluctuation compared to parasite free populations and the endemic parasite was generally found at high prevalence within the infected groups. When hosts infected with G. blattarum were exposed to S. carpocapsae, the resulting co-infection led to reduced host survival but also reduced emergence of nematode transmission stages. Hosts infected with G. blattarum also had differential immune responses to macro and microparasites which could alter host susceptibility to different types of infections.\r\n\r\nInfection with an endemic parasite caused substantial changes in the biology of the host, which may have important effects on host population ecology. Endemic parasites can also have considerable consequences for the transmission potential of more a virulent pathogen. These findings demonstrate the important of endemic infections which should be given greater consideration in future host-parasite studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Randall, Joanna"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":70054,"sim:weight":0.252677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26480,"sim:weight":0.222894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86227,"sim:weight":0.210941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643971,"sim:weight":0.201868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28937,"sim:weight":0.172928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75346,"sim:weight":0.171218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45093,"sim:weight":0.163255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643700,"sim:weight":0.159016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.151981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75835,"sim:weight":0.150254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176851,"sim:weight":0.134003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1644010,"sim:weight":0.117783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.113849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1644003,"sim:weight":0.109494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To date, there is no individual marker for this progenitor\r\nsub-population; however, markers located to mesenchymal stem cells have been\r\nidentified in articular cartilage. Using immunofluorescence, this study demonstrated\r\nthe localisation of the stem cell markers, CD44, CD49e, CD105 and CD166 to the\r\nsuperficial zone of bovine immature articular cartilage. CD29 and the developmental\r\nmarkers, Notch1, Delta1, Jagged1, Jagged2 and Msx1 were located in cells\r\nthroughout the tissue. The restricted expression of the majority of these stem cell\r\nmarkers to predominantly the superficial zone in immature bovine complements the\r\nappositional growth model notion and greatly suggests a resident stem cell\r\npopulation.\r\nTo further investigate and quantify expression of these differentiation and stem cell\r\nmarkers, superficial zone cells were isolated, immunolabelled and analysed using\r\nflow cytometry. In addition, cells were cultured for 24 hours in monolayer for\r\ncomparison and to enable epitope recovery. Stem cell marker expression was absent\r\nor reduced following cell isolation and upregulated following monolayer culture.\r\nDevelopmental markers displayed expression comparable to that seen in tissue\r\nfollowing cell isolation, but expression was absent after monolayer culture. The\r\ndifferences observed suggest cell surface marker cleavage during cell isolation and\r\nsubsequent cell adhesion and proliferation.\r\nTo assess the changes in expression, superficial zone cells were cultured for 14 days,\r\nto provide a proxy for dedifferentiated cells. Superficial zone chondrocytes were\r\nimmunolabelled at day 3, 7 and 14 and analysed using flow cytometry. The majority\r\nof cell surface receptors exhibited a unimodal increase in expression indicative of a\r\nhomogeneous population. The number of cells expressing CD44 increased with time\r\nin culture, from 3 to 14 days, characteristic of cells adhering to plastic. Bimodal\r\ndistributions were observed with CD105 and CD117, after 14 days in culture. This\r\nexpression has not previously been reported and demonstrates a distinct and discrete\r\nsubset of cells equating to 1-2% of the total superficial zone population analysed,\r\ncomparable to chondroprogenitor percentages previously reported.\r\nThe use of specific markers to isolate chondroprogenitors will allow for further\r\ncharacterisation, including a more in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of\r\nproliferation and differentiation within articular cartilage. This has the potential to\r\nlead to an improved understanding of the role of these markers and, as such, may\r\nprovide us with a more beneficial cell type that could significantly contribute to the\r\nfield of articular cartilage repair.","bibo:AuthorList":["Richardson, Kirsty"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.342515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75980,"sim:weight":0.301275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222957,"sim:weight":0.299136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75685,"sim:weight":0.290501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76969,"sim:weight":0.279513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929810,"sim:weight":0.265492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77074,"sim:weight":0.264874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631685,"sim:weight":0.238831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.230744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222942,"sim:weight":0.226951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77259,"sim:weight":0.223286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1644031,"sim:weight":0.209197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.202536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76581,"sim:weight":0.19191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222810,"sim:weight":0.181214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.178326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76741,"sim:weight":0.152256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77174,"sim:weight":0.140491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the rate\r\nand texture of the sediment supply, determined by the topography, lithology, climate,\r\nand vegetation cover of the drainage basin, play important roles in affecting the\r\nresultant rates of bank erosion, bend growth, and form of floodplain erosion that\r\ngenerate sinuosity and oxbow lake production. We illustrate this point with examples\r\nof our recent studies of channel mobility and floodplain erosion and sedimentation.\r\nThe supply of bed material to a reach accelerates point bar growth that increases\r\nthe cross-channel acceleration of flow and intensifies bank erosion.

The observation of monopoles in certain artificial systems, and their absence from other similar structures, is a significant puzzle. Connected artificial spin-ice structures attract much attention in terms of the possibility to read states electrically, and offer the possibility of monopole defect control via well-understood domain wall processes. Nevertheless, full comprehension of the underlying processes is lacking. Here, we establish one of the overriding components. We demonstrate using high-resolution scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) the cooperative process associated with two transverse domain walls that creates the monopole defect in NiFe. The feature size of the array is large compared to the exchange length in the ferromagnet, and the two transverse domain walls give a rich internal structure to the monopole defect vertex. The magnetic Coulomb repulsion between two domain walls carrying the same sign of magnetic charge stabilizes the monopole defects at fields greater than the depinning field for a single wall at that vertex. These observations allow us to form an overview of monopole defect control possibilities from extrinsic pinning as in Co arrays (the extreme extrinsic limit being isolated bar structures) to intrinsic pinning captured here.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ladak, Sam","Read, Daniel","Tyliszczak, Tolek","Branford, Will R.","Cohen, Lesley F."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1088/1367-2630","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.272133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15428,"sim:weight":0.247009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26706,"sim:weight":0.230011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23892,"sim:weight":0.22288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26944,"sim:weight":0.189319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28947,"sim:weight":0.188726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26735,"sim:weight":0.163117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631735,"sim:weight":0.16045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76901,"sim:weight":0.147838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77295,"sim:weight":0.144392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.138601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222860,"sim:weight":0.124175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.119975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22904,"sim:weight":0.103512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100346,"sim:weight":0.102202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26377,"sim:weight":0.0973268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

By varying dQW for HgTe, the material properties of the QW material change from semiconducting to semimetallic as dQW is increased above a value of about 6nm. We have studied the PR of devices made from CdxHg1−xTe/HgTe/CdxHg1−xTe wafers with values of the QW width in the range of 6 nm ≤ dQW ≤ 21 nm. Only for samples with semimetallic HgTe QWs, a measurable PR could be detected. However, our investigations of samples made from AlxIn1−xSb/InSb/AlxIn1−xSb wafers gave evidence that a measurable PR also can appear from devices with a semiconducting QW. Both cyclotron-resonant (CR) and nonresonant (bolometric, BO) interaction mechanisms can contribute to the PR signal. Whereas the CR contribution is dominant in AlxIn1−xSb/InSb/AlxIn1−xSb samples, in CdxHg1−xTe/HgTe/CdxHg1−xTe samples the behavior is more complex. In a sample with dQW \u003d 8 nm, the PR is clearly dominated by the BO contribution. In the PR of another sample of dQW \u003d 12 nm, both contributions (BO and CR) are present.

We believe that the Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA) is the only device that can measures the biomechanical properties of the cornea in vivo. However, it has been used for the first time both in vivo and in vitro. This thesis presents a clinical and laboratory investigation of the biomechanical properties of the cornea before/after LASIK and corneal cross-linking to improve our understanding of the knowledge required in both the laboratory and the clinic. Different machines were used in this project, including an ORA, an Oculus Pentacam, a spectrophotometer and a UV-X Illumination system.\r\nLaser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is, at present, one of the most well-known operations used to correct refractive errors; however, ocular problems arising from corneal thinning have been reported in some previous studies. Therefore, I looked at the effects of surgery on the central/peripheral thickness and the anterior/posterior curvature, and determined to what extent they affect the biomechanical properties of the cornea.\r\nDuring the past decade, much research has focused on improving and developing a new operation called corneal collagen cross-linking with riboflavin and UVA, which is used to stop the progression of keratectasia in the cornea (which occurs in keratoconus and sometimes follows refractive surgery). In the next phase, a range of experiments were conducted on cross-linking to determine to what extent this operation affects the molecular structure and biomechanical properties of the cornea.\r\nThis thesis has shown for the first time that it is possible to obtain ORA signals in vitro and this opened up the possibility of examining whole eyes as well as excised corneas. It is also confirmed that the values of CH do not represent only a corneal biomechanical property, but rather depend on the presence of the rest of the eye. These in vitro studies have opened up a number of possibilities the future corneal biomechanical studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alhamad, Tariq"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Whilst representing only a facet of early land vegetation, initial studies indicate that these minute axes with terminal sporangia continue to make a significant\r\ncontribution to the understanding of biodiversity and development of terrestrial ecosystems during the Lower Devonian. As well as exceptional anatomical preservation, many sporangia contain in situ spores, many of which represent new taxa (both cryptospore and trilete), whilst\r\nsome have been recognised in the dispersed spore record, but not previously been recorded in situ. A new investigation aims to obtain detailed morphological, anatomical and ultrastructural data on both the mesofossils (particularly the axes) and their in situ spores, predominately using SEM and TEM techniques. With this data it is hoped that the affinity of these mesofossils may\r\nbe elucidated, and their taxonomic relationship with the early tracheophytes and bryophytes can be explored. Recent evidence of highly-branched mesofossil sporophyte axes suggests that at least some of these minute plants may represent stem-group embryophytes with bryophytic\r\ncharacters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morris, Jennifer Louise","Edwards, Dianne","Richardson, J.

This creates a\r\nnew social construct in the form of virtual communities based on communal\r\nconsumption, which are widely known as brand communities. To date a number of\r\nstudies have researched brand communities by emphasising social theories and been\r\nconducted in a Western context. Few studies have addressed behavioural theories and\r\ninvestigated these groups in an Asian context like Thailand, which has a growing\r\nnumber of consumer brand communities. This thesis uses a behavioural perspective and\r\nhighlights the role of intentional dimension in the analysis of consumer behaviour in\r\nthese communities.\r\nThe thesis aims to investigate and explain the rationale for rewards which maintain\r\nconsumer participation in Thai car-consumer clubs. To do so it adopts the Behavioural\r\nPerspective Model (BPM) as a primary interpretive device to develop a qualitative\r\nmultiple-case study of seven Thai car-consumer clubs. Rule-governed behaviour is also\r\nexamined in this thesis. The results of the BPM interpretive analysis demonstrate that\r\nthe members’ behaviours in the Thai car-consumer clubs take place in a relatively\r\nclosed setting that is maintained by high levels of both functional reinforcement (such\r\nas car-knowledge) and symbolic reinforcement (such as friendship). Foremost of all,\r\nstatus is the key symbolic reinforcement which performs as a gateway to other rewards.\r\nThe value of symbolic reinforcement such as status is derived from collective\r\nintentionality that can be found in cooperative behaviour and in the beliefs and attitude\r\nof the intentional language of people in a particular context. In essence, the emergence\r\nof Thai car-consumers clubs involves the capacity for behaviour to be reinforced\r\nthrough mutual rewards. Therefore, members’ participation in the car-consumer clubs is\r\nfacilitated by the rewards which are socially mediated by members of the community.","bibo:AuthorList":["Laparojkit, Sumana"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108946,"sim:weight":0.388199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108980,"sim:weight":0.337848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176822,"sim:weight":0.285103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76564,"sim:weight":0.259281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85837,"sim:weight":0.25035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631884,"sim:weight":0.238852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.233853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316083,"sim:weight":0.225285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.223746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.198886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.196481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.196481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77372,"sim:weight":0.189765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.179171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74937,"sim:weight":0.177668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.160547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The coordinating centre team was led by one of the senior investigators, who was closely involved in planning and day to day trial management. Of 1 243 282 women invited, 23.2% (288 955) replied that they were eligible and would like to participate. Of those sent appointments, 73.6% (205 090) attended for recruitment. The acceptance rate varied from 19% to 33% between trial centres. Measures to ensure target recruitment included named coordinating centre staff supporting and monitoring each centre, prompt identification and resolution of logistic problems, varying the volume of invitations by centre, using local non-attendance rates to determine the size of recruitment clinics, and organising large ad hoc clinics supported by coordinating centre staff. The trial randomised 202 638 women in 4.3 years.\r\n\r\nConclusions Planning and trial management are as important as trial design and require equal attention from senior investigators. Successful recruitment needs constant monitoring by a committed proactive management team that is willing to explore individual solutions for different centres and use central resources to improve local recruitment. Automation of trial processes with web based trial management systems is crucial in large multicentre randomised controlled trials. Recruitment can be further enhanced by using information videos and group discussions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Menon, Usha","Gentry-Maharaj, Aleksandra","Ryan, Andy","Sharma, Aarti","Burnell, Matthew","Hallett, Rachel","Lewis, Sara","Lopez, Alberto","Godfrey, Keith","Oram, David","Herod, Jonathan","Williamson, Karin","Seif, Mourad","Scott, Ian","Mould, Tim","Woolas, Robert","Murdoch, John","Dobbs, Stephen","Amso, Nazar Najib","Leeson, Simon","Cruickshank, Derek","McGuire, Ali","Campbell, Stuart","Fallowfield, Lesley","Skates, Steve","Parmar, Mahesh","Jacobs, Ian"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1136/bmj.a2079","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8337,"sim:weight":0.533351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780059,"sim:weight":0.451501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8270,"sim:weight":0.429982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.316415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.284143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23820,"sim:weight":0.262316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222629,"sim:weight":0.219586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77494,"sim:weight":0.193625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631565,"sim:weight":0.19288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176825,"sim:weight":0.180263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.155366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76708,"sim:weight":0.150764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.137825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.133615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109025,"sim:weight":0.133066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54903,"sim:weight":0.13002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The ability of S. aureus to acquire resistance to a diverse range of antimicrobial compounds, results in limited treatment options, particularly in methicillin-resistant S. aureus. A mechanism by which S. aureus develops reduced susceptibility to antimicrobials is through the formation of small colony variants (SCVs). Reduced antimicrobial susceptibility in S. aureus SCVs is not related to ‘classical’ mechanisms of resistance, but occurs as a direct result of the development of the SCV phenotype. S. aureus SCVs are frequently associated with defects in the bacterial electron transport chain and these defects are responsible for the characteristics associated with the SCV phenotype.\r\n\r\nThis study aimed to investigate and characterise the selection of S. aureus SCVs in the presence of various antibiotics and also to examine their biofilm forming capabilities.   Four members of the aminoglycoside family of antibiotics were shown to select for S. aureus SCVs. In addition, a broad range (X 0.25 MIC – X 4 MIC) of aminoglycoside concentrations were shown to select for S. aureus SCVs. Characterisation of these isolates revealed that differences in auxotrophy, biochemical profiles, carotenoid production, haemolysis, levels of intracellular ATP, mutation frequency and reversion rate were present. Members of the tetracycline family of antibiotics were also shown to select for S. aureus SCVs. Tetracycline selected S. aureus SCVs show attenuated catalase, coagulase and heamolysis activity and reduced production of extracellular DNase and lipase and reduced susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents. As SCVs have been linked to persistent and recurrent infections their ability to form biofilms was also investigated. A range of S. aureus SCVs isolated from various backgrounds were shown to form greater biofilms in comparison to parent strains, which was attributed to increased production of polysaccharide intracellular adhesin. In addition S. aureus SCV biofilms displayed a more pronounced reduction in antimicrobial susceptibility, which was attributed to a reduction in antimicrobial penetration through SCV biofilms.\r\n\r\nLimited discovery of novel antibiotics in recent years and the observation that S. aureus SCVs can be selected for by various antimicrobial compounds highlights the need for novel antimicrobial compounds. Accordingly, an investigation into the susceptibility of S. aureus to various plant compounds was undertaken. Both S. aureus SCVs and parent strains showed susceptibility to five plant antimicrobials tested, of which SCVs were more susceptible to cinnamon bark, green tea and oregano. Resistance to these plant antimicrobials could not be induced and synergistic relationships between certain plant antimicrobials and antibiotics were demonstrated. Finally, formation of SCVs in bacterial species other than S. aureus was examined. Gentamicin induced SCV selection in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. epidermidis as well as chloroamphenicol and ciprofloxacin in E. coli and tetracycline in S. epidermidis. SCVs from these bacterial species shared common characteristics associated with the SCV phenotype including altered growth and biochemical profiles, auxotrophy for compounds involved in electron transport, reduction in expression of virulence factors and reduced antimicrobial susceptibility. Additionally all SCVs showed an increased capacity to form biofilms.\r\n\r\nThe ability of certain antibiotics to select for SCVs and their increased capacity to form biofilms suggest that SCV are an important adaptation to aid survival and persistence in times of stress. Reduced susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics in SCVs signifies that the development of new antimicrobial compounds is required. Harnessing naturally occurring plant antimicrobials and their synergistic relationship with antibiotics may offer a novel approach to treating antibiotic resistant infections whilst overcoming antibiotic selection for SCVs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Norville, Phillip"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85118,"sim:weight":0.203553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930803,"sim:weight":0.202119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24401,"sim:weight":0.181447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75818,"sim:weight":0.171066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76202,"sim:weight":0.137431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75835,"sim:weight":0.135905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76816,"sim:weight":0.127314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826716,"sim:weight":0.125901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222853,"sim:weight":0.124389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.122852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75896,"sim:weight":0.107287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We have investigated healthy control participants to see whether there is a common neural system activated during such social decisions, on the basis that deficits in this system may contribute to the impairments seen in these disorders.\r\n\r\nMethod We investigated the neural basis of social decision making during judgements of approachability and intelligence from faces in 24 healthy participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Metastases, rather than primary tumours, are responsible for most cancer-related deaths. Invasive cancer cells acquire a migratory phenotype which is associated with an increased expression of several genes involved in cell motility. Actin, which is the most abundant protein in most eukaryotic cells, is necessary for whole cell locomotion. Reorganisation of actin filaments is regulated by a highly integrated signalling cascade governed by ‘molecular switches’ which belong to the Rho GTPase family. WASP family proteins are downstream molecules which form a link between the GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton. The WASP family includes 5 members and is structurally divided into 2 groups: Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome proteins (WASPs) and WASP verprolin homologous proteins (WAVEs). Current evidence suggests that WAVEs are crucial for cell motility and metastasis.

Physiotherapy is being more frequently recommended for people with HD, but there have been no specific guidelines published for implementation of a structured physiotherapy program. The Physiotherapy Working Group (PWG) of the European Huntington’s Disease Network (EHDN) set out to develop a comprehensive Guidance Document for physiotherapists to provide best practice guidelines. Methods: A review of the literature was conducted using a systematic approach. There was insufficient literature in support of physiotherapy interventions and approaches to be able to conduct a complete evidenced-based review, therefore, physiotherapy expert subgroups were formed to incorporate consensus as to best practice. A draft document was distributed to the entire membership of the working group, to outside physiotherapists and other healthcare professionals within EHDN to elicit feedback and comments. Results: A Guidance Document covering eight specific areas pertaining to physiotherapy management of HD was developed. In order to facilitate the document’s practical usability among clinicians, a treatment-based classification system is proposed to categorize patients based on presenting signs and symptoms, and provide a foundation for development of a more standardized intervention approach. Discussion: The Physiotherapy Guidance for HD is a comprehensive, consensus- and evidence-based document that can be used by physiotherapists to implement a plan of care that is currently consistent with best practice for individuals at all stages of HD. As evidence becomes available, future systematic reviews will be required in order to inform further development. The use of treatment-based classifications, which aim to better categorize common signs and symptoms and link them to appropriate intervention plans, may be useful in relatively rare diseases, such as HD, to aid clinical reasoning and promote effective outcome evaluation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Quinn, Lori","Busse, Monica"],"dc:date":"2012-02","doi":"10.2217/nmt.11.67","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222799,"sim:weight":0.448887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.35489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.329415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77721,"sim:weight":0.286707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13965,"sim:weight":0.24641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.216421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.210539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.202373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.199859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76136,"sim:weight":0.190965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.179761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5941,"sim:weight":0.167688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.162073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75002,"sim:weight":0.161815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.152996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631760,"sim:weight":0.1368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is well-established in the literature that a lack of\r\ntemporal contiguity – a delay between cause and effect – can have an adverse effect on causal\r\ninduction. However research has tended to focus almost exclusively on the extent of delay while\r\nignoring the potential influence of delay variability. This thesis aimed to address this oversight.\r\nSince humans tend to experience causal relations repeatedly over time, we accordingly\r\nexperience multiple cause-effect intervals. If intervals are constant, it becomes possible to predict\r\nwhen the effect will occur following the cause. Fixed delays thus confer temporal predictability,\r\nwhich may contribute to successful causal inference by creating an impression of a stable\r\nunderlying mechanism. Five experiments confirmed the facilitatory effect of predictability in\r\ninstrumental causal learning. Two experiments involving a different aspect of causal judgment\r\nfound no effects of interval variability, but two further experiments demonstrated that\r\npredictability facilitates elemental causal induction from observation. These results directly\r\nconflict with findings from studies of animal conditioning, where preference for variable- interval\r\nreinforcement is routinely exhibited, and a simple associative account struggles to explain this\r\ndisparity. However both a temporal coding associative account, and higher-level cognitive\r\nperspectives such as Bayesian structural inference, are compatible with these findings. Overall,\r\nthis thesis indicates that causal learning involves processes above and beyond simple\r\nassociations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greville, William"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85827,"sim:weight":0.273449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84550,"sim:weight":0.212231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222953,"sim:weight":0.188914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85083,"sim:weight":0.166831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.166488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.163447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.159594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.159594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.15404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.15404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.150911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.150911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108946,"sim:weight":0.145502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.14033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.131123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109175,"sim:weight":0.130575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999700,"sim:weight":0.129296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108980,"sim:weight":0.128412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.128166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.128166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It starts by reviewing research on group-based emotions in adults’ intergroup relations, and on social identity processes in children. It is argued that studying children’s group-based emotions might enhance our understanding of group-level\r\nbullying.\r\nInitial results suggested that group-based emotions related to supporting and resisting cyberbullying depend upon children’s social identity, and that group-based emotions lead to specific action tendencies (Study 1). Wider group norms were investigated in Studies 2 and 3. In Study 2 the prevailing normative context shaped responses to bullying, while in Study 3 peer group norms had a greater influence\r\nthan school norms on children’s responses to bullying.\r\nThe way that children manage their social identity in response to bullying was examined in Study 4. How strongly perpetrator’s group members identified with that group was determined by initial ingroup identification and the\r\nperpetrator’s group norm. How group norms shape interpretations of bullying when it is ostensibly negative (Study 5a) or ostensibly positive (Study 5b) was studied\r\nnext. It was found that certain group-based emotional responses and action tendencies were inhibited when the bullying was misaligned with group norms.\r\nGroup processes in school bullying incidents were examined in Study 6. A qualitative analysis of teachers’ accounts of bullying revealed that although bullying is responded to primarily at the group level, such responses do not directly address group processes. In Chapter 8 I draw the thesis together by highlighting the role that group processes play in children’s responses to bullying. Implications for antibullying work are discussed. It is concluded that successful intervention rests on awareness of the group processes (a) that lead children to become involved in bullying, and (b) by which bullying may be resisted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Sian"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108239,"sim:weight":0.484172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77943,"sim:weight":0.216087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75734,"sim:weight":0.204569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.186372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388776,"sim:weight":0.180445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632042,"sim:weight":0.179894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87201,"sim:weight":0.17665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.176634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77372,"sim:weight":0.174967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.17411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.169066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":294473,"sim:weight":0.167796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77291,"sim:weight":0.164755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.159629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.156542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75667,"sim:weight":0.147726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76564,"sim:weight":0.126722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Additionally, a 3D stack registration method was produced by modifying an existing algorithm. A related project was to develop a pre-apoptotic retinal monitoring based on the changes in texture parameters of the OCT scans in order to enable treatment before the changes become irreversible; apoptosis refers to the programmed cell death that can occur in retinal tissue and lead to blindness. These issues can be critical for the examination of tissues within the central nervous system.\r\nA novel statistical model for segmentation has been created and successfully applied to a large data set. A broad range of future research possibilities into advanced pathologies has been created by the results obtained. A separate model has been created for choroid segmentation located deep in retina, as the appearance of choroid is very different from the top retinal layers. Choroid thickness and structure is an important index of various pathologies (diabetes etc.).\r\nAs part of the pre-apoptotic monitoring project it was shown that an increase in proportion of apoptotic cells in vitro can be accurately quantified. Moreover, the data obtained indicates a similar increase in neuronal scatter in retinal explants following axotomy (removal of retinas from the eye), suggesting that UHR-OCT can be a novel non-invasive technique for the in vivo assessment of neuronal health.\r\nAdditionally, an independent project within the computer science department in collaboration with the school of psychology has been successfully carried out, improving analysis of facial dynamics and behaviour transfer between individuals. Also, important improvements to a general signal processing algorithm, dynamic time warping (DTW), have been made, allowing potential application in a broad signal processing field.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kajic, Vedran"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5849072,"sim:weight":0.330142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15010,"sim:weight":0.244672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.199137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.19635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.19635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.193722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.193722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.190884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26194,"sim:weight":0.182678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77153,"sim:weight":0.177134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.147814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222959,"sim:weight":0.133188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25992,"sim:weight":0.128181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75306,"sim:weight":0.128019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76149,"sim:weight":0.120387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While the need for such innovation policies is well recognised, there is also a need to understand the key challenges to developing effective policy interventions for the innovation process that will create sound economic leverage (Harvey, 2010).\r\nA new method that helps us understand the innovation process at the organisational level has been developed, by working across disciplines and synthesising different methodologies. Constructs adopted from the Minnesota Innovation Research Programme (MIRP) were used to gather and analyse data. The methodological approach followed was a fusion of the Interactive Process Perspective (IPP) and Institutional Theory (IT). This method has been used to further explain the complexities of the innovation process by demonstrating the co-operation and contestation between actors from different interest groups in terms of agency and structure.\r\nEvidence of how innovation centres exhibit different characteristics relating to their local context along with the specific actors populating them is provided. Those actors bring their own institutional logics, belief systems and associated practices to their centres. The importance which the local context of an MNT Centre has within the extra-local context of the state intervention is shown to have a major bearing on its original purpose.\r\nFor practitioners some important points have been raised: the intended purpose of the MNT government intervention was shown to evolve across MNT centres; the key influential actors of each centre demonstrably followed different institutional systems of reasoning, which in some cases resulted in internal conflicts.\r\nAs demonstrated in this study, the ingrained institutional thinking and reasoning of actors can be difficult to change for the intended purpose of an intervention, once funding has already been awarded.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dorrington, Peter"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.37549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632272,"sim:weight":0.344968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.253739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.243832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.237622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.237622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.234334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631763,"sim:weight":0.221269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.193448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Published guidance recommends that whenever possible children with long-term conditions remain at home, meaning parents may be responsible for performing the majority of clinical care-giving. Multidisciplinary team members, therefore, spend considerable time promoting parents\u0027 learning about care-delivery and monitoring care-giving. However, this parent-educative aspect of clinicians\u0027 role is rarely articulated in the literature so little evidence exists to inform professionals\u0027 parent-teaching interventions. \r\nMethods\r\nThis ongoing study addresses this issue using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods involving the twelve children\u0027s kidney units in England, Scotland and Wales. Phase I involves a survey of multidisciplinary team members\u0027 parent-teaching interventions using: i) A telephone-administered questionnaire to determine: the numbers of professionals from different disciplines in each team, the information/skills individual professionals relay to parents and the teaching strategies/interventions they use. Data will be managed using SPSS to produce descriptive statistics ii) Digitally-recorded, qualitative group or individual interviews with multidisciplinary team members to explore their accounts of the parent-teaching component of their role. Interviews will be transcribed anonymously and analysed using Framework Technique. Sampling criteria will be derived from analysis to identify one/two unit(s) for subsequent in-depth study Phase II involves six prospective, ethnographic case-studies of professional-parent interactions during parent-teaching encounters. Parents of six children with a long-term kidney condition will be purposively sampled according to their child\u0027s age, diagnosis, ethnicity and the clinical care-giving required; snowball sampling will identify the professionals involved in each case-study. Participants will provide signed consent; data gathering will involve a combination of: minimally-obtrusive observations in the clinical setting and families\u0027 homes; de-briefing interviews with participants to obtain views on selected interactions; focussed \u0027verbatim\u0027 field-notes, and case-note reviews. Data gathering will focus on communication between parents and professionals as parents learn care-giving skills and knowledge. Interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed anonymously. \r\nDiscussion\r\nThis study involves an iterative-inductive approach and will provide a unique, detailed insight into the social context in which professionals teach and parents learn; it will inform professionals\u0027 parent-educative roles, educational curricula, and health care policy","bibo:AuthorList":["Swallow, Veronica M.","Allen, Davina Ann","Williams, Julian","Smith, Trish","Crosier, Jean","Lambert, Heather","Qizalbash, Leila","Wirz, Lucy","Webb, Nicholas J.

Deng et al. Phys. Rev. B 59 R5312 (1999)]. We present calculations for conditions of zero bias at 10 K. It is shown that both the SIA and BIA parameters scale approximately linearly with carrier density, and exhibit a marked dependence on well width when alloy composition is adjusted to allow maximum upper barrier height for a given well width. In contrast to other material systems, the BIA contribution to spin splitting is found to be of significant and comparable value to the SIA mechanism in these structures. We calculate the spin lifetime τs[11̅ 0] for spins oriented along [11̅ 0] based on D’yakonov–Perel’ mechanism using both the theory of Averkiev et al. J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 14 R271 (2002) and also directly the rate of precession of spins about the effective magnetic field, taking into account all three SO couplings, which show good agreement. τs[11̅ 0] is largest in the narrowest wells over the range of moderate carrier densities considered, which is attributed to the reduced magnitude of the k-cubic BIA parameter in narrow wells. The inherently large BIA induced SO coupling in these systems is shown to have considerable effect on τs[11̅ 0], which exhibits significant reduction in the maximum spin lifetime compared to previous studies that consider systems with relatively weak BIA induced SO coupling. The relaxation rate of spins oriented in the [001] direction is found to be dominated by the k-linear SIA and BIA coupling parameters and at least an order of magnitude greater than in the [11̅ 0] direction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gilbertson, A.","Fearn, M.","Jefferson, J.","Murdin, B.","Buckle, Philip Derek","Cohen, L."],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevB.77.165335","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1567256,"sim:weight":0.296968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.177679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77295,"sim:weight":0.176436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108727,"sim:weight":0.169661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23890,"sim:weight":0.159355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26377,"sim:weight":0.152442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269537,"sim:weight":0.148202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This technique indicated substantial thermally induced graphitization of the film within a close proximity to the surface. While in the bulk region of the film no graphitization was observed with either Raman spectroscopy or NEXAFS spectroscopy recorded in total electron yield mode, even after annealing to 1200 °C.

Diamond thin films with a thickness below 350 nm and with boron concentration ranging from 1017 to 1021 cm−3 have been investigated. UV Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy have been used to assess the quality and morphology of the diamond films. Hall-effect measurements confirmed the expected p-type conductivity. At room temperature, the conductivity varies from 1.5×10−8 Ω−1 cm−1 for a nonintentionally doped film up to 76 Ω−1 cm−1 for a heavily B-doped film. Increasing the doping level results in a higher carrier concentration while the mobility decreases from 1.8 down to 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1. For NCD films with low boron concentration, the conductivity strongly depends on temperature. However, the conductivity and the carrier concentration are no longer temperature dependent for films with the highest boron doping and the NCD films exhibit metallic properties. Highly doped films show superconducting properties with critical temperatures up to 2 K. The critical boron concentration for the metal-insulator transition is in the range from 2×1020 up to 3×1020 cm−3. We discuss different transport mechanisms to explain the influence of the grain boundaries and boron doping on the electronic properties of NCD films. Valence-band transport dominates at low boron concentration and high temperatures, whereas hopping between boron acceptors is the dominant transport mechanism for boron-doping concentration close to the Mott transition. Grain boundaries strongly reduce the mobility for low and very high doping levels. However, at intermediate doping levels where hopping transport is important, grain boundaries have a less pronounced effect on the mobility. The influence of boron and the effect of grain boundaries on the optoelectronic properties of the NCD films are examined using spectrally resolved photocurrent measurements and photothermal deflection spectroscopy. Major differences occur in the low energy range, between 0.5 and 1.0 eV, where both boron impurities and the sp2 carbon phase in the grain boundaries govern the optical absorption.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gajewski, W.","Achatz, P.","Williams, Oliver Aneurin","Haenen, K.","Bustarret, E.","Stutzmann, M.","Garrido, J."],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevB.79.045206","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1567785,"sim:weight":0.582595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631529,"sim:weight":0.297011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76750,"sim:weight":0.271702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176856,"sim:weight":0.263039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631735,"sim:weight":0.258154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108788,"sim:weight":0.238053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567269,"sim:weight":0.231156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12226,"sim:weight":0.226059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26619,"sim:weight":0.214373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11977,"sim:weight":0.211761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222993,"sim:weight":0.206295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26123,"sim:weight":0.190338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.183281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108299,"sim:weight":0.178102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108874,"sim:weight":0.172635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108364,"sim:weight":0.163436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85937,"sim:weight":0.163099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85747,"sim:weight":0.153635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1594217,"sim:weight":0.153432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.151571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

BMPs have been implicated in the development and progression of solid tumours, particularly the disease-specific bone metastasis. In breast cancer, a tumour type which most commonly metastasizes to bones, aberrations of both BMP expression and their signalling have been recently demonstrated. These aberrations have certain correlations with the development and progression of the disease. Recent in vitro studies have also demonstrated that BMPs can regulate a range of biological functions of breast cancer cells. Targeting BMPs or BMP signalling may provide novel therapeutic approaches for breast cancer.

One is that the data providers are independent of others and they can run systems which were developed on different platforms at different times using different software products to respond to different needs of information. A second arises from the data modelling used to convert the real world data into a computerised data structure which is not conditioned by a universal standard. Most importantly the need for interoperation between these disparate data sources is to get accurate and useful information for further analysis and decision making.\r\nThe software representation of a universal or a single data definition structure for depicting a biodiversity entity is ideal. But this is not necessarily possible when integrating data from independently developed systems. The different perspectives of the real-world entity when being modelled by independent teams will result in the use of different terminologies, definition and representation of attributes and operations for the same real-world entity.\r\nThe research in this thesis is concerned with designing and developing an interoperable flexible framework that allows data integration between various distributed and heterogeneous biodiversity data sources that adopt XML standards for data communication. In particular the problems of scope and representational heterogeneity among the various XML data schemas are addressed.\r\nTo demonstrate this research a prototype system called BUFFIE (Biodiversity Users‘ Flexible Framework for Interoperability Experiments) was designed using a hybrid of Object-oriented and Functional design principles. This system accepts the query information from the user in a web form, and designs an XML query. This request query is enriched and is made more specific to data providers using the data provider information stored in a repository. These requests are sent to the different heterogeneous data resources across the internet using HTTP protocol. The responses received are in varied XML formats which are integrated using knowledge mapping rules defined in XSLT \u0026 XML. The XML mappings are derived from a biodiversity domain knowledgebase defined for schema mappings of different data exchange protocols. The integrated results are presented to users or client programs to do further analysis.\r\nThe main results of this thesis are: (1) A framework model that allows interoperation between the heterogeneous data source systems. (2) Enriched querying improves the accuracy of responses by finding the correct information existing among autonomous, distributed and heterogeneous data resources. (3) A methodology that provides a foundation for extensibility as any new network data standards in XML can be added to the existing protocols. The presented approach shows that (1) semi automated mapping and integration of datasets from the heterogeneous and autonomous data providers is feasible. (2) Query enriching and integrating the data allows the querying and harvesting of useful data from various data providers for helpful analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sundaravadivelu, Rathinasabapathy"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Currently, some of these devices are unsuitable for use on\r\npatients with diabetes or DVI and have poor sensitivity for detecting moderate PAD\r\npatients. Additionally, some of the tests, particularly for DVI, require tourniquets or\r\nthe patient to perform postural changes which some may find difficult. This may\r\nextend testing time. The study investigated 2 groups of patients, one with PAD and\r\nthe other with DVI. The arterial group consisted of 46 controls and 57 patients. PPG\r\nprobes were placed on the index finger and great toe. The venous group consisted of\r\n24 controls and 25 patients and PPG probes were placed behind the knee and 10 cm\r\nabove the medial malleolus. Duplex ultrasound was used as the gold standard to\r\nassess the arteries and veins in the lower limbs. The aim was to investigate whether\r\nsignals acquired from patients at rest using Photoplethysmography (PPG) could be\r\nused as a screening tool. Pulse wave transit time (PWTT) and shape analysis\r\ntechniques were used on the pulses from the patients with PAD, while time base and\r\nspectral analysis techniques were used on the waveforms of patients with DVI. PWTT\r\nand shape analysis techniques achieved sensitivities and specificities of 82% and 84%\r\nrespectively. Accuracy dropped to 70% for detecting patients with moderate PAD.\r\nSpectral analysis techniques gave the best results for detecting patients with DVI\r\nachieving sensitivities and specificities of 69% and 80% respectively. In conclusion,\r\nreducing the signal acquisition time on patients with PAD did not significantly reduce\r\nthe sensitivity and specificity.

Innovations in media technologies, increasingly competitive and fragmenting markets for readers and advertising revenues, government media policy, the changing structures of news industries and changing audience requirements for news and the ways in which it is presented and delivered, are impacting on journalists’ employment, and changing radically the ways in which journalism organisations and media businesses function. One response to such changes has been to speculate about the ‘end of newspapers’. The assumption informing this paper, as well as the evidence it presents, suggest that such predictions are ahistorical, reflect a Eurocentric view of press developments and within the UK, ignore significant differences in newspapers’ fortunes deriving from their location in distinctive market sectors. The argument of this paper is that UK newspapers are adapting and accommodating to these developments by changing almost every aspect of their style, form and contents. The declining newspapers titles, circulation and advertising revenues which typify UK and European newspapers, have no counterpart in India, China, Latin America and parts of Africa where the newspaper business is booming.","bibo:AuthorList":["Franklin, Robert Arthur"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929841,"sim:weight":0.330804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.310168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930235,"sim:weight":0.308499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.264273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930362,"sim:weight":0.259511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84996,"sim:weight":0.239916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44158,"sim:weight":0.234691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929894,"sim:weight":0.234443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8254,"sim:weight":0.225027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.221219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929836,"sim:weight":0.199176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.194797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.194797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75348,"sim:weight":0.180977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929834,"sim:weight":0.180645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.154944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The use of\r\nthis route in coal fired power plants is not fully understood and the likelihood of\r\nsolvent degradation is high. Decreased absorption efficiency, undesirable byproducts,\r\nthe environmental impact of their disposal and increased process costs\r\nare the main consequences.\r\nIn this study, two experimental rigs were designed and commissioned to explore\r\nthe effects of gas composition and temperature on monoethanolamine\r\ndegradation. Analytical procedures to detect and quantify its major thermal and\r\noxidative degradation products were also developed.\r\nIt became apparent early on that solvent degradation, under actual plant\r\nconditions, is a slow phenomenon, thus, it was decided to focus on thermal\r\ndegradation. The present study uniquely enabled the absorption/desorption\r\nbehaviour of thermally degraded solvents to be evaluated. The major thermal\r\ndegradation products were quantified.\r\nAfter 14 full absorption/stripping cycles at the presence of 16% oxygen and 15%\r\ncarbon dioxide, significant concentrations of nitrites and nitrates were detected in\r\nthe samples. Thermal degradation at 160 oC for 8 weeks reduced\r\nmonoethanolamine concentration by almost 95%, as evidenced by the chemical\r\nanalysis, but the remaining solvent retained 22% of its capacity to remove carbon\r\ndioxide. Therefore, although not fully quantified, the requirement for\r\nmonoethanolamine make-up may not be quite as serious as initially believed.\r\nThere is some evidence to support that the rate of thermal degradation was\r\nenhanced as carbon dioxide loading increased and a 20% higher MEA loss was\r\ndetermined in the samples with the rich initial molar loading.

But economic integration was no guarantee. Discrimination and negative media portrayals were cited as particular barriers by new migrants, while in some apparently integrated and cohesive settled contexts, particular vulnerable groups (e.g. older people and women) remained excluded. These amounts are after income tax, and do not include housing or childcare costs.\r\n    There was no evidence that community tensions are an inevitable consequence of new immigration. White immigration, whether middle-class professional, student or migrant worker, appeared to be invisible to local populations in Cardiff. Educated migrants with good English, whatever their ethnic or national background or migrant status, and whether living in deprived or affluent areas, integrated more easily than others.\r\n    Age-based and generational tensions of different kinds existed across all the groups and geographical areas studied. Among young people, some expressed hostility toward migrants; others shared education, sport and social outings together. Older people in all groups expressed anxieties about the behaviours of young people.\r\n    Poverty and deprivation had a direct and negative impact on inclusion and cohesion in the case study areas. People who were poor or living in deprived areas, from both migrant and settled communities, felt they were treated poorly by those in positions of power and described similar discrimination and attitudes among service providers.

A content analysis of 974 newspaper articles about British Muslims in the British\r\nPress from 2000 to 2008;\r\n2. An analysis of the visuals/images used in articles about British Muslims in the British\r\nPress in 2007 and 2008;\r\n3. A series of case studies of stories about British Muslims in the British Press.\r\nOur findings suggest that the coverage of British Muslims has increased significantly since\r\n2000, peaking in 2006, and remaining at high levels in 2007 and 2008. This rise is partly\r\nexplained by the increase in coverage devoted to terrorism and terrorism related stories -\r\n36% of stories about British Muslims overall are about terrorism. This is especially notable\r\nafter the terrorist attacks in the US and the UK in 2001 and 2005.\r\nIn recent years, however, we have seen the increasing importance of stories focusing on\r\nreligious and cultural differences between Islam and British culture or the West in general\r\n(22% of stories overall) or Islamic extremism (11% overall). Indeed, 2008 was the first year\r\nin which the volume of stories about religious and cultural differences (32% of stories by\r\n2008) overtook terrorism related stories (27% by 2008). Coverage of attacks on or problems\r\nfacing Muslims, on the other hand, has steadily declined as a proportion of coverage. In sum,\r\nwe found that the bulk of coverage of British Muslims - around two thirds - focuses on\r\nMuslims as a threat (in relation to terrorism), a problem (in terms of differences in values) or\r\nboth (Muslim extremism in general).\r\nThe language used about British Muslims reflects the negative or problematic contexts in\r\nwhich they tend to appear. Four of the five most common discourses used about Muslims in\r\nthe British press associate Islam/Muslims with threats, problems or in opposition to\r\ndominant British values. So, for example, the idea that Islam is dangerous, backward or\r\nirrational is present in 26% of stories. By contrast, only 2% of stories contained the\r\nproposition that Muslims supported dominant moral values.\r\nSimilarly, we found that the most common nouns used in relation to British Muslims were\r\nterrorist, extremist, Islamist, suicide bomber and militant, with very few positive nouns (such\r\nas ‘scholar’) used. The most common adjectives used were radical, fanatical,\r\nfundamentalist, extremist and militant. Indeed, references to radical Muslims outnumber\r\nreferences to moderate Muslims by 17 to one.\r\nOne in five stories about British Muslims makes comparisons between Islam and other\r\nreligions. While around half of these comparisons do not make explicit value judgments, of\r\nthose that do, negative assessments of Islam outnumber positive assessments by more than\r\nfour to one. Negative assessments are particularly prominent in the tabloids.\r\nThe visual representation of Muslims reflects the portrayals described in the content analysis.\r\nWe found a widespread use of police mugshots used in the portrayal of Muslim men (with all\r\nthe negative associations these carry), while two of the most common venues used for\r\n4\r\nimages of Muslim men were outside police stations and law courts. This is very much in\r\nkeeping with the high proportion of terrorism related stories about British Muslims.\r\nThe visuals used also indicate the focus on cultural/religious differences, with Muslims seen\r\nengaged in religious practice in a way non-Muslims rarely are, and with Muslim men being\r\nfar more visible than Muslim women (while we found more equal proportions of images of\r\nnon-Muslim men and women). We also found that Muslims are often identified simply as\r\nMuslims rather than as individuals or particular groups with distinct identities. So, for\r\nexample, Muslims are much less likely than non-Muslims to be identified in terms of their\r\njob or profession, and much more likely to be unnamed or unidentified (especially in\r\ngroups).\r\nOur case studies focussed upon stories that foreground the ‘war on terror’, cultural/religious\r\ndifferences and Muslim extremism, as well as the use of certain discourses. We also\r\nexamined news reports where information had been exaggerated or distorted. Overall, while\r\nwe found articles that worked hard to remain objective and impartial, many others played up\r\nthese newsworthy angles at the expense of balance and context. Thus, a number of stories\r\nwere framed within the perceived threat and fear of Islam. Britain was, for example,\r\nbecoming a place of Muslim only, “no-go” areas, where churches were being replaced by\r\nmosques; and Sharia law would soon be implemented.\r\nThis was further personalised in the reconstituting of statements by community leaders, such\r\nas the head of the Muslim Council of Britain and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Both had\r\nstatements taken out of context, and reinterpreted in the worst possible light, often ignoring\r\nthe caveats, nuances or relevant details of the original statements. In the first case, an\r\nexpression of concern about the rise of Islamophobia and a parallel drawn with the\r\nintolerance to Jews in 1930s Germany became, ironically enough, a story about Muslim\r\nextremism (FURY AS MUSLIM BRANDS BRITAIN \u0027NAZI\u0027). Similarly, a rather dense\r\ndiscussion of the relation between theology and the law became an ‘OUTBURST’ and a\r\n‘VICTORY FOR TERRORISM’. In the latter story, the ‘dangerous’ Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury’s considered speech on Sharia law became a treatise on the necessity for limb\r\nremoval and stoning.\r\nIn short, these stories were written to emphasise their newsworthy elements to such an extent\r\nthat the original facts quickly became obscured in a tide of outrage and condemnation.\r\nDecontextualisation, misinformation and a preferred discourse of threat, fear and danger,\r\nwhile not uniformly present, were strong forces in the reporting of British Muslims in the\r\nUK national press.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, Kerry","Mason, Paul","Lewis, Justin Matthew Wren"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929831,"sim:weight":0.547022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.385766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76471,"sim:weight":0.379472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107298,"sim:weight":0.374353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.340315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.314954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76118,"sim:weight":0.279783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75606,"sim:weight":0.248225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.247185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.243446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.235927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52776,"sim:weight":0.22761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77960,"sim:weight":0.207205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.203248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.19154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.19154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.150064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper presents recent developments to the optimization software VICONOPT MLO, a multilevel optimization interface between the analysis and design software packages VICONOPT and MSC/NASTRAN. The software developed, VICONOPT MLOP (Multilevel Optimization with Postbuckling) incorporates postbuckling behaviour, allowing individual panels to buckle before the design load is reached, while carrying load at a reduced stiffness. By combining two iterative cycles the first of which (known as the analysis cycle) calculates these reduced postbuckling stiffnesses at an individual panel level in order to converge on an appropriate load distribution at a whole structure or system level and the second of which (known as the design cycle) optimizes individual panels based on this load redistribution to converge on an optimized mass for the whole structure. The paper provides a detailed overview of the functionality of the software and a case study is conducted into the optimization of a composite aircraft wing. The results of the case study show substantial mass savings, proving the software’s capabilities when dealing with such problems. The time taken for this multilevel optimization also demonstrates the efficiency of the software.","bibo:AuthorList":["Qu, S.","Kennedy, David","Featherston, Carol Ann"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1177/0954410011415158","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26959,"sim:weight":0.258669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31303,"sim:weight":0.253276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26022,"sim:weight":0.250817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30234,"sim:weight":0.246859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.236027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26028,"sim:weight":0.235805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24911,"sim:weight":0.199201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.193779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26015,"sim:weight":0.192284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26517,"sim:weight":0.177031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.167543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.160709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25819,"sim:weight":0.156512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27903,"sim:weight":0.143619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This simple model, based on a single relaxation time, has many shortcomings. Among these is the lack of freedom to extend the model to complex fluids whose stress tensors are characterized by more complicated constitutive relations. The lattice Boltzmann methodology may be generalized by considering the full collision matrix and tuning the matrix elements to obtain the desired macroscopic properties. The generalized hydrodynamics of a generalized lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) was studied by Lallemand and Luo Phys. Rev. E 61 6546 (2000)] by solving the dispersion equation of the linearized LBE. In this paper, an alternative approach to solving the dispersion equation based on a formal perturbation analysis is described. The methodology outlined is systematic, can be readily applied to other lattices, and does not require the reciprocals of the relaxation times to be small.\r\n\r\n\r\n© 2008 The American Physical Society","bibo:AuthorList":["Reis, T.","Phillips, Timothy Nigel"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevE.77.026702","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23321,"sim:weight":0.451982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269863,"sim:weight":0.439871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85525,"sim:weight":0.326504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23332,"sim:weight":0.322979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10865,"sim:weight":0.297531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5839588,"sim:weight":0.294637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24222,"sim:weight":0.293424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.237449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100230,"sim:weight":0.227326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76807,"sim:weight":0.187576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.174023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2381185,"sim:weight":0.172961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26023,"sim:weight":0.150202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Understanding the neural underpinnings of these normative changes creates a foundation for investigating adolescence as a period of vulnerability to affective disorders, substance use disorders, and health problems.

The current study focused on puberty-specific changes in brain function and their association with mood.\r\n\r\nMethod\r\nA sample of 77 healthy adolescents (26 pre-/early pubertal, 51 mid-/late pubertal) recruited in a narrow age range (mean \u003d 11.94 years, SD \u003d 0.75) were assessed for sexual maturation and circulating testosterone, completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) guessing task with monetary reward, and underwent experience sampling of mood in natural environments.

Science news is not formed in a social,\r\neconomic, or cultural vacuum.

EUROSPHERE is an integrated project which is funded by the\r\nEuropean Commission within the EU’s 6th Framework Programme. The EUROSPHERE\r\nConsortium comprises seventeen European universities and research institutes and\r\napproximately 100 researchers work in the project\u0027s different parts and phases. Two of our\r\npartners have now left the Consortium after having successfully completed their tasks in the\r\nproject. The project is coordinated by this author on behalf of the University of Bergen.\r\nEUROSPHERE was launched in February 2007 and will go on until March 2012.\r\nThe main objective of EUROSPHERE is to create innovative perspectives on the\r\nEuropean public spheres and to identify the conditions that enable or undermine the\r\narticulation of democratic and inclusive European public spheres. The focus is on how\r\nparticipation of different kinds of social and political actors in the public debates – political\r\nparties, social movement and non-governmental organizations, think tanks and research\r\ninstitutes, and newspapers and TV broadcasters – shape the articulation and structuring of the\r\nemerging public European public sphere. The research plan of the project comprises\r\nsynchronized data collection and analysis activities in sixteen countries as well as creation of\r\na EUROSPHERE Knowledgebase on the European organizations that are participating in\r\npublic debates at local, national and European levels. In addition to regular research and\r\nacademic dissemination activities, EUROSPHERE organizes four large-scale international\r\nconferences, two European Forums, and four researcher training and PhD courses.\r\nThe EUROSPHERE Country Reports Series represents the finalization of the very first\r\nstep of a comprehensive comparative research programme. The aim of this series is to provide\r\na brief summary of a huge data material collected by the project researchers. Along with the\r\nEUROSPHERE Knowledgebase that we created, these reports will be a basis and data search\r\nguide for the forthcoming comparative studies of sixteen countries. Therefore, the primary\r\nreadership target of these reports is the EUROSPHERE researchers who are to conduct twelve\r\ninter-related comparative studies of different aspects of the European public spheres. This\r\nprimary function of the report series necessitated prioritization of a descriptive approach at\r\nthis stage of our research. Explanations of the findings and applications of theory are\r\nidentified in our plans as the task of the work groups who will do the comparative analyses, as\r\nwe believe cross-contextual comparisons and understanding of the particularities of specific\r\ncontexts should go together in order to obtain a more enhanced picture of reality.\r\nMore information about EUROSPHERE can be found in our frequently visited webpage.\r\nMy task in this foreword is to give the background of the EUROSPHERE Country Report\r\nSeries. In the following, I will briefly present the logic behind the project and the\r\nmethodological approaches in selection of the cases – that is, organizations and respondents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wahl-Jorgensen, Karin","Cushion, Stephen","Williams, Andrew James","Guerra, Simona","Garcia-Blanco, Inaki","Tsagalas, Dimitrios"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631263,"sim:weight":0.350394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.342824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.342824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.326064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1559155,"sim:weight":0.298055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.296866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.269089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643996,"sim:weight":0.253608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.251688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929894,"sim:weight":0.171595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Critical social theorists have advanced an alternative perspective and undertaken a critique of work, responding to the interlinked social problems of mass unemployment, inequality, environmental degradation, and low well-being, by promoting an anti-productivist politics which calls for a decentralisation of work in everyday life. Theorists such as André Gorz have suggested that such proposals resonate with a cultural disenchantment with work, as well as growing desire for non-material goods such as autonomy, free-time, good-health and conviviality. Such claims, however, have rarely been explored on an empirical level. One of the central questions that remain unanswered is whether and how it is actually possible for people to live with significantly lower levels of work. In response to this gap in the literature, the present study undertakes a qualitative investigation into the lives of a diverse sample of people, each of whom has chosen to work less or to give up working altogether. In-depth interviews explore the work experiences and moral priorities that informed the participant’s lifestyle changes. Also explores are the trials of working less, including how participants coped with less money, and how they coped with the stigmas attached to working less, in the midst of a society that continues to attach moral significance to having a job. Are the participants deviants, malingerers, and failures, or might society learn something positive and inspiring from their actions and choices?","bibo:AuthorList":["Frayne, David"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.38023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222965,"sim:weight":0.299855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.299803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.294434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.294434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.290216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.285375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.283243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.26704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108065,"sim:weight":0.262981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.25224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76022,"sim:weight":0.251556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.248896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74937,"sim:weight":0.245166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109179,"sim:weight":0.243909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.241768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734403,"sim:weight":0.232674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76873,"sim:weight":0.224714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is localized in q12-q21 of the human chromosome 17 and is often co-amplified with erbB-2. However, the role played by MLN64 in breast cancer remains unclear. In the present study, the expression of MLN64 was examined in a breast cancer cohort using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining. It demonstrated that MLN64 was highly expressed in breast tumours compared to corresponding background tissues at both transcript level and protein level. The elevated level of MLN64 transcripts was correlated with the poor prognosis and overall survival of the patients. A panel of breast cancer cell sublines was subsequently developed by knockdown of MLN64 expression. Loss of MLN64 expression in MCF-7 cells resulted in a significant reduction of cell growth (absorbance for MCF-7ΔMLN64 being 0.87±0.07, P\u003c0.01 vs. wild-type control (MCF-7WT 1.13±0.06) and transfection control (MCF-7pEF 1.27±0.05). In cell-matrix adhesion assay, MDA-MB-231ΔMLN64 cells showed a significant increase in adhesion (86±14), p\u003c0.01 compared with both MDA-MB-231WT (61±20) and MDA-MB-231pEF (45±27). Further investigations demonstrated an increase in protein level of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in MDA-MB-231ΔMLN64 cells using Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining of FAK. Moreover, addition of FAK inhibitor to these cells diminished the effect of MLN64 on cell-matrix adhesion, suggesting that FAK contributed to the increased adhesion in MDA-MB-231ΔMLN64 cells. In conclusion, MLN64 is overexpressed in breast cancer, and its level correlates with poor prognosis and patient survival. MLN64 contributes to the development and progression of breast cancer through the regulation of cell proliferation and adhesive capacity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cai, Wei","Ye, Lin","Sun, Jiabang","Mansel, Robert Edward","Jiang, Wen Guo"],"dc:date":"2010-04","doi":"10.3892/ijmm_00000379","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931557,"sim:weight":0.356199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222812,"sim:weight":0.326686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397434,"sim:weight":0.302162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.280136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.273612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.266483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76612,"sim:weight":0.234333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.229271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76866,"sim:weight":0.228865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929888,"sim:weight":0.222084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76804,"sim:weight":0.2214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631809,"sim:weight":0.217982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76062,"sim:weight":0.21211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780069,"sim:weight":0.18595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76003,"sim:weight":0.184647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.176442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.168607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.163506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23816,"sim:weight":0.160983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75588,"sim:weight":0.152675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Rather than merely accepting that sonar noise results in unavoidable error in active sonar systems, this research explores various methodologies to reduce the detrimental effect of noise.\r\nOur approach is to analyse the statistics of sonar noise in trial data, collected by a long-range active sonar system in a shallow water environment, and apply this knowledge to target detection. Our detectors are evaluated against imulated targets in simulated noise, simulated targets embedded in noise-only trial data, and trial data containing real targets.\r\nFirst, we demonstrate that the Weibull and K-distributions offer good models of sonar noise in a cluttered environment, and that the K-distribution achieves the greatest accuracy in the tail of the distribution. We demonstrate the limitations of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test in the context of detection by thresholding, and investigate the upper-tail Anderson-Darling test for goodness-of-fit analysis. The\r\nupper-tail Anderson-Darling test is shown to be more suitable in the context of detection by thresholding, as it is sensitive to the far-right tail of the distribution, which is of particular interest for detection at low false alarm rates. We have also produced tables of critical values for K-distributed data evaluated by the upper-tail Anderson-Darling test.\r\nHaving established suitable models for sonar noise, we develop a number of detection statistics. These are based on the box-car detector, and the generalized likelihood\r\nratio test with a Rician target model. Our performance analysis shows that both types of detector benefit from the use of the noise model provided by the K-distribution. We\r\nalso demonstrate that for weak signals, our GLRT detectors are able to achieve greater probability of detection than the box-car detectors. The GLRT detectors are also easily\r\nextended to use more than one sample in a single test, an approach that we show to increase probability of detection when processing simulated targets.\r\nA fundamental difficulty in estimating model parameters is the small sample size. Many of the pings in our trial data overlap, covering the same region of the sea. It is\r\ntherefore possible to make use of samples from multiple pings of a region, increasing the sample size. For static targets, the GLRT detector is easily extended to multi-ping\r\nprocessing, but this is not as easy for moving targets. We derive a new method of combining noise estimates over multiple pings. This calculation can be applied to either\r\nstatic or moving targets, and is also shown to be useful for generating clutter maps. We then perform a brief performance analysis on trial data containing real targets, where we show that in order to perform well, the GLRT detector requires a more accurate model of the target than the Rician distribution is able to provide. Despite this, we show that both GLRT and box-car detectors, when using the K-distribution as a noise model, can achieve a small improvement in the probability of detection by combining estimates of the noise parameters over multiple pings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bareš, Robert"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176886,"sim:weight":0.266991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75136,"sim:weight":0.261403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.250964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75265,"sim:weight":0.246713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.237817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108798,"sim:weight":0.232913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147453,"sim:weight":0.230608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631822,"sim:weight":0.224268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26675,"sim:weight":0.221645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.220847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26670,"sim:weight":0.209191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75365,"sim:weight":0.202114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1549802,"sim:weight":0.192449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.184728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176877,"sim:weight":0.160179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, little is known about\r\nwhat beliefs people hold about them. The present paper\r\nexamines: (a) the patterns of mild analgesic usage in a\r\nsample of university students, (b) their beliefs about the\r\nassociated risks and the necessity of taking mild analgesics,\r\nand (c) the association between beliefs about analgesics\r\nand self-reports of their use. Setting A convenience sample\r\nof 333 students studying at a large English University were\r\napproached on the University campus.

Method This\r\nstudy employed a cross-sectional design, with all participants\r\ncompleting the same questionnaire concerning their\r\nuse of mild painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen,\r\nand beliefs about their use. Main outcome measure Four\r\nquestions asked about their patterns of mild analgesic use\r\nin the past month, specifically (a) have they taken analgesics,\r\n(b) how often did they take analgesics when they\r\nhad symptoms, (c) did they take more than a single dose of\r\n1–2 tablets at one time, and (d) did they exceed the maximum\r\ndose. Results Almost all of the 291 participants\r\nreported symptoms in the past month, with over two thirds\r\ntreating with mild analgesics, and one sixth exceeding the\r\nmaximum dose. Only 17% indicated that there were shortterm\r\nrisks of using mild analgesics, although half indicated\r\nthat there were long-term risks.

The proposed framework also solves two fundamental problems, which are cell planning and frequency planning, simultaneously. The feasibility of the final network solutions are then evaluated by OPNET simulator.","bibo:AuthorList":["Teterin, Vitaly"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.0798225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":2825921,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical behaviour of MX80 bentonite in geotechnical applications","bibo:abstract":"Due to their high swelling ability, high water retention capacity and low permeability, compacted bentonites\r\nhave been considered as a key component of cover lining systems for storage of low and medium level toxic\r\nwastes and as barrier and backfilling materials for long-term safe storage of high level toxic waste in many\r\ncountries. This thesis presents an experimental, theoretical and numerical study of thermo-hydromechanical-\r\nchemical behaviour of MX80 bentonite in geotechnical applications.\r\nThe determination of swelling pressures of compacted bentonites is an important aspect of most bentonitebased\r\nbarrier systems. Swelling pressures of bentonites are usually determined in the laboratory under\r\nconstant volume conditions using oedometers. Powdered bentonites are usually compacted in stainless steel\r\ncylindrical specimen rings and tested immediately after the compaction process is completed. The swelling\r\npressures thus measured are influenced by some post compaction residual stresses. However, bentonites in\r\nthe form of pellets and bricks are prepared and used in repository conditions that, in turn, are free from any\r\npost compaction residual stresses. The influence of post compaction residual stress on swelling pressures of\r\ncompacted bentonites for a range of dry density that are of interest has not been explored in the past. Such\r\nstudies are of potential interest for the safe and efficient designs of toxic waste disposal repositories. Many\r\nof the waste repositories are commissioned in locations where the ground water either contains significant\r\namount of salts or the repositories are anticipated to receive saline water from sea. Additionally, in some\r\ncases, the wastes that are disposed emit very high temperatures (e.g. spent fuel). Under these repository\r\nconditions, compacted bentonite barriers are subjected to both thermal and hydraulic loadings at opposite\r\nboundaries. A detailed study devoted to appreciate the combined influence of an elevated temperature, bulk\r\nfluid type and solute transport due to both hydraulic and thermal gradients are necessary to better the\r\nunderstanding of the mechanical behaviour of compacted bentonites in many practical engineering\r\nproblems.\r\nConstant volume swelling pressure tests were carried out on compacted MX80 bentonite specimens in order\r\nto study the influence of post compaction residual stress, electrolyte concentration and temperature (for\r\nisothermal conditions) on the swelling pressure. The dry density of the bentonite was varied between 1.1 to\r\n1.9 Mg/m3 to cover a wide range of compaction conditions. Theoretical assessments of swelling pressures\r\nwere made using the Gouy-Chapman diffuse double layer theory and the Stern theory, as applicable to\r\ninteracting clay platelet systems. Further, the experimental and the theoretical swelling pressures were\r\ncompared in order to bring out the applicability of the electrical theories in assessing swelling pressures of\r\nbentonites for both compacted saturated and initially saturated slurried conditions. A series of thermal and\r\nthermo-hydraulic tests were carried out on bentonite specimens under laboratory scale settings. During the\r\nthermal tests, temperatures of 85 and 25 °C were applied at the bottom and top ends of the specimens,\r\nrespectively. During the thermo-hydraulic tests, in addition to unequal temperature at opposite ends, distilled\r\nwater was supplied from the top end of the specimens. The temperature and the relative humidity were\r\nmonitored along predetermined depths of the specimens during both types of testing methods. The swelling\r\npressure variations were monitored at the opposite end of the heat source. Changes in water content, dry\r\ndensity and concentrations of cations and anions along predetermined depths of the specimens were\r\nmeasured after termination of each of the tests. A thermo-hydro-mechanical finite element simulation was\r\nundertaken specifically for swelling pressures using the numerical code COMPASS (COde for Modelling\r\nPArtially Saturated Soils). Further, the experimental and the simulated results were compared both for\r\nthermal and thermo-hydraulic boundary conditions.\r\nCompacted bentonite specimens with post compaction residual stresses exhibited lesser swelling pressures\r\nas compared to their stress released counterparts. Agreements between the calculated swelling pressures\r\nfrom the Stern theory and the experimental swelling pressure results were found to be reasonable for\r\ncompaction dry densities of less than 1.45 Mg/m3, whereas at higher dry densities, agreements between the\r\nmeasured swelling pressures and those calculated from the electrical theories were found to be poor.\r\nConversely, compressibility behaviour of initially saturated slurried bentonites was found to be captured\r\nwell by the electrical theories. On account of vapour flow under thermal gradients, compacted bentonite\r\nspecimens exhibited swelling pressures at the opposite end of the heat source. The measured swelling\r\npressure for the thermal gradient adopted varied between 0.5 to 1.2 MPa, whereas greater swelling pressures\r\nwere noted due to an applied thermo-hydraulic gradient. Evaporation, condensation, diffusion and advection\r\nprocesses influenced the distribution of ions in compacted bentonite when subjected to both thermal and\r\nthermo-hydraulic gradients. The finite element code, COMPASS, enabled assessing changes in suction and\r\nswelling pressure of compacted bentonite satisfactorily under both thermal and thermo-hydraulic hydraulic\r\ngradients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bag, Ramakrishna"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85952,"sim:weight":0.274638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76680,"sim:weight":0.270846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25064,"sim:weight":0.238014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386982,"sim:weight":0.22856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176859,"sim:weight":0.2254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512837,"sim:weight":0.205945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222872,"sim:weight":0.187795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.171743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108521,"sim:weight":0.167193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55755,"sim:weight":0.165109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76426,"sim:weight":0.156316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222904,"sim:weight":0.1539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77039,"sim:weight":0.149494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77263,"sim:weight":0.147863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53848,"sim:weight":0.147258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77568,"sim:weight":0.144713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.14266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316479,"sim:weight":0.135432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108243,"sim:weight":0.128665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97743,"sim:weight":0.124576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The conduction mechanism in the case of the low-conductivity films close to the metal-insulator transition has a temperature dependence similar to Efros-Shklovskii type of hopping.

This is of crucial importance in DNA biosensor development. The covalent nature of DNA attachment will infer the necessary stability and favorable orientation to the ssDNA probe molecules. Using confocal fluorescence microscopy, the influence of buffer type for the removal of excess 10-UDA and ssDNA, the probe ssDNA length, the probe ssDNA concentration, and the presence of the COOH-linker on the density and functionality of the ssDNA probe layer were investigated. It was determined that the most homogeneously dense and functional DNA layer was obtained when 300 pmol of short ssDNA was applied to COOH-modified NCD samples, while H-terminated NCD was resistant for DNA attachment. Exploiting this surface functionality dependence of the DNA attachment efficiency, a shadow mask was applied during the photochemical introduction of the COOH-functionalities, leaving certain regions on the NCD H-terminated. The subsequent DNA attachment resulted in a fluorescence pattern corresponding to the negative of the shadow mask. Finally, NCD surfaces covered with mixtures of the 10-UDA linker molecule and a similar molecule lacking the COOH functionality, functioning as a lateral spacer, were examined for their suitability in preventing nonspecific adsorption to the surface and in decreasing steric hindrance. However, purely COOH-modified NCD samples, patterned with H-terminated regions and treated with a controlled amount of probe DNA, proved the most efficient in fulfilling these tasks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vermeeren, V.","Wenmackers, S.","Daenen, M.","Haenen, K.","Williams, Oliver Aneurin","Ameloot, M.","vandeVen, M.","Wagner, P.","Michiels, L."],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1021/la800946v","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1560586,"sim:weight":0.237393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512637,"sim:weight":0.203029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222852,"sim:weight":0.186795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84807,"sim:weight":0.169832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631556,"sim:weight":0.160057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76556,"sim:weight":0.148557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10835,"sim:weight":0.135694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75335,"sim:weight":0.0989177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These BDD films were investigated using a rotating analyzer variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) from the near IR to UV range (830–193 nm). By applying the conventional Bruggeman effective medium approximation and linear regression analyses to the raw SE data that is, [ψ(λi),Δ(λi)] and pseudodielectric function (〈εr(λi)〉,〈εi(λi)〉), we determined the most appropriate model fit. The SE modeling was performed through the normal and point-by-point fit methods combined with the coupled and uncoupled bulk and surface layer approaches providing the details about the thin films’ microstructure in terms of the (a) multilayer (component and surface) structure and component layer thickness of the films, (b)volume fraction of constituents [fsp3 C, fsp2 C and void (fv) in the component layer], (c) inhomogeneity of the structure along the growth axis and its variation with boron concentration, and (iv) surface roughness layer thickness (ds) with dimensions less than the optical wavelength that is not otherwise available. A simplified three-layer structural model consisting of an interfacial layer, an intermediate (or bulk) layer, and a top surface roughness layer has been proposed, which simulates the ellipsometry data reasonably well with coupled point-by-point method. An estimator, i.e., mean squared error (χ2), is used to assess the accuracy of the model fit. The results (surface roughness and constituents’ fraction) obtained through SE modeling are also compared with those from atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy to validate the layered model employed. Typically, high surface roughness values around 6 nm were found for films grown under different boron concentrations which is almost five times smaller than determined from AFM. In this context, we determined an approximate linear relationship between these two variables. The relatively smaller surface roughness for BDD films indicates the combined role of boron-hydrogen (B, H) in diamond (C) while keeping the substrate temperature constant. We also discussed the variation of (fv and fnd) for the bulk and surface layers with increasing boron concentration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gupta, S.","Dudipala, A.","Williams, Oliver Aneurin","Haenen, K.","Bohannan, E."],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1063/1.2990058","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":11977,"sim:weight":0.341655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84924,"sim:weight":0.294266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631529,"sim:weight":0.293848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176856,"sim:weight":0.281643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76556,"sim:weight":0.247986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.247641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631735,"sim:weight":0.243028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26619,"sim:weight":0.24269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.233041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632041,"sim:weight":0.228623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780054,"sim:weight":0.227023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.215232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76244,"sim:weight":0.204032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77335,"sim:weight":0.200253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222993,"sim:weight":0.198921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.197404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85937,"sim:weight":0.197133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.188059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109199,"sim:weight":0.185802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108874,"sim:weight":0.185105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In an attempt to examine the scenario of AC practices from the perspective of an emerging economy like Bangladesh, this study investigates the state of AC practices in the companies listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE).\r\nThis study was undertaken through a questionnaire survey and an interview survey in order to collect the data. The respondents of these surveys consisted of four sample groups, namely: the AC Chairperson, the Company Secretary, the Head of Finance, and the External Auditor. The objective of the interviews was to complement the findings of the questionnaire survey by obtaining a greater insight into the issue.\r\nThe findings of the study indicate that the overall effectiveness of ACs in Bangladesh is not at a satisfactory level. More specifically, the observations made in the study include: (i) the ACs are mostly dominated by executive directors; (ii) the expertise (in terms of qualification and experience) of AC members is not at a satisfactory level; (iii) the AC members do not devote much time to the committee’s affairs; (iv) the independent members of the committee are not adequately remunerated for the time and effort devoted to the company; and, (v) although the ACs are playing an important role in some areas including financial reporting, external auditing and internal auditing, there is still plenty of scope where the ACs can play a more proactive role. The study also found that the opinions of three sample groups namely, the AC Chairperson, the Company Secretary and the Finance Head were similar in most of the aspects of AC practices while the External Auditor group differed from the other three groups in some areas.\r\nFurthermore, the current study identified areas that need improvement in order to obtain more effective services from the ACs in Bangladesh. These include: (i) lack of qualification of the AC members; (ii) lack of experience of the AC members; (iii) majority of executive members in the ACs; and, (iv) lack of diligence of the AC members.\r\nThe measures that can be taken to improve the effectiveness of ACs in Bangladesh include issues such as: (i) introducing new rules in relation to AC composition (in terms of minimum qualification and experience of AC members, and the number of independent members); (ii) enhancing the monitoring of compliance with the existing rules in relation to AC practices (instead of leaving them on a ‘comply or explain’ basis); and (iii) strengthening the internal audit functions of the company.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohiuddin, Md."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1653708,"sim:weight":0.311728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.285634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.281432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108567,"sim:weight":0.278226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316147,"sim:weight":0.273606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.257627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109146,"sim:weight":0.253225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85650,"sim:weight":0.241797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84170,"sim:weight":0.241412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222885,"sim:weight":0.240278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.233539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.223512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.220156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108914,"sim:weight":0.213798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108532,"sim:weight":0.210307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930474,"sim:weight":0.194114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77362,"sim:weight":0.178974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109008,"sim:weight":0.177698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734394,"sim:weight":0.177099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734375,"sim:weight":0.15267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, multiple sources of data in diverse forms are required in the construction of a model in order to define its components and their biochemical reactions, and corresponding parameters. Automating the assembly and use of systems biology models is dependent upon data integration processes involving the interoperation of data and analytical resources.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nTaverna workflows have been developed for the automated assembly of quantitative parameterised metabolic networks in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). A SBML model is built in a systematic fashion by the workflows which starts with the construction of a qualitative network using data from a MIRIAM-compliant genome-scale model of yeast metabolism. This is followed by parameterisation of the SBML model with experimental data from two repositories, the SABIO-RK enzyme kinetics database and a database of quantitative experimental results. The models are then calibrated and simulated in workflows that call out to COPASIWS, the web service interface to the COPASI software application for analysing biochemical networks. These systems biology workflows were evaluated for their ability to construct a parameterised model of yeast glycolysis.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nDistributed information about metabolic reactions that have been described to MIRIAM standards enables the automated assembly of quantitative systems biology models of metabolic networks based on user-defined criteria. Such data integration processes can be implemented as Taverna workflows to provide a rapid overview of the components and their relationships within a biochemical system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Li, P.","Dada, J.

Two complementary data sets are considered: all-sky maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP); and large area maps of galaxies detected through the sub-millimetre electromagnetic emission using the Herschel Space Observatory.\r\n\r\nThe standard model predicts the distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB to be Gaussian, homogeneous and isotropic.  Since they could deviate from the standard model in many different ways, a number of complementary descriptors are required.\r\n\r\nAll-sky maps of the CMB are often decomposed into spherical harmonic modes.  Any modes aligned with the Galactic plane are particularly interesting because anomalous behaviour in them could indicate errors in the subtraction of Galactic foreground.  Here a simple statistical analysis of these modes is tested and shown to be a useful diagnostic of possible foreground subtraction systematics.\r\n\r\nIn addition, two methods for characterizing large-scale anisotropy in all sky CMB maps are discussed.

The thesis explores why family courts have been singled out for particular criticism in undertaking these functions. Two issues are examined: complaints that family court proceedings are held in secret and that a court is not the appropriate place for resolving disputes about children. The methods used are historical analysis, a comparison with courts in Australia, and applying the theories of Habermas.\r\nAccording to Habermas, when systems are maintained for their own sake without being anchored in people\u0027s values and needs, or operate without rational discourse, institutions can lose their legitimacy. The historical analysis shows that as social policy developed over the past 60 years, court structures were trapped in a dual jurisdiction which made it difficult to adapt to changing expectations. Since the 1970s, there have been calls for a unified family court to better meet families‘ requirements. However, a comparison with such a court, the Family Court of Australia, reveals another set of dualities which undermine its legitimacy.\r\nThe claim that family courts do not function effectively because they are closed and secret is examined. The law is set out in the context of concepts of secrecy, privacy, openness and transparency. It is argued that children have a particular right to privacy which is marginalised in the current debate, and that a recent consultation process undertaken to reform the law on media access to court proceedings was not undertaken in a transparent manner.\r\nAttempts to introduce alternative dispute resolution and remove disputes about child care and upbringing to mediation and other non-legal alternatives are also shown as likely to fail unless formulated through rational discourse.","bibo:AuthorList":["Doughty, Julie"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631647,"sim:weight":0.411349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77112,"sim:weight":0.284664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.283524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654845,"sim:weight":0.251608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.244992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.238865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.227021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.227021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77372,"sim:weight":0.215969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The same parameters were measured in three other unswollen normal corneas before and after iso-osmolar cross-linking and in three pairs of swollen normal corneas, in which only the left was cross-linked (with iso-osmolar riboflavin).\r\n\r\nResults\r\nHypo-osmolar cross-linking resulted in an increase in corneal hydration in all corneas. In the keratoconus corneas and unswollen normal corneas, this was accompanied by an increase in collagen interfibrillar spacing (p\u003c0.001); an increase in fibril diameter was also seen in two out of four unswollen normal corneas and one unswollen keratoconus cornea (p\u003c0.001). Iso-osmolar cross-linking resulted in a decrease in tissue hydration in the swollen normal corneas only. Although there was no consistent treatment-induced change in hydration in the unswollen normal samples, iso-osmolar cross-linking of these corneas did result in a compaction of collagen fibrils and a reduced fibril diameter (p\u003c0.001); these changes were not seen in the swollen normal corneas. Collagen D-periodicity was not affected by either treatment.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe observed structural changes following Ultraviolet-A cross-linking with hypo-osmolar or iso-osmolar riboflavin solutions are more likely a consequence of treatment-induced changes in tissue hydration rather than cross-linking.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hayes, Sally","Boote, Craig","Kamma-Lorger, Christina S.","Rajan, Madhavan S.","Harris, Jonathan L.","Dooley, Erin Patricia","Hawksworth, Nicholas","Hiller, Jennifer","Terill, Nick J.","Hafezi, Farhad","Brahma, Arun K.","Quantock, Andrew James","Meek, Keith Michael Andrew"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0022405","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5845199,"sim:weight":0.206383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77179,"sim:weight":0.136423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76783,"sim:weight":0.129764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631793,"sim:weight":0.0865927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5532,"sim:weight":0.0813001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76548,"sim:weight":0.07979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75539,"sim:weight":0.0744768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15010,"sim:weight":0.0733036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76969,"sim:weight":0.065107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631669,"sim:weight":0.0594999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780054,"sim:weight":0.055627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108734,"sim:weight":0.050399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.0502712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It has become clear that the TJ is an important structure that cancer cells must overcome in order to metastasize successfully. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the importance of the expression of occludin in human breast cancer. Human tissues and breast cancer cell lines were amplified for functional regions of occludin. Tumour tissues showed truncated and/or variant signals. There was also considerable variation in the expression of occludin in the 10 human breast cancer cell lines investigated. Western blotting demonstrated that variants in the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines did not fit the expected occludin signals for changes in phosphorylation status. Immunostaining showed similarly disparate levels of expression. Ribozyme knockdown resulted in increased invasion, reduced adhesion and significantly reduced TJ functions. Q-RT-PCR analysis of 124 tumour and 33 background human breast tissues showed occludin to be significantly decreased in patients with metastatic disease. Immunohistochemical staining showed a decreased expression of occludin in the tumour sections. This study demonstrates for the first time that occludin is differentially expressed in human breast tumour tissues and cell lines. This loss of or aberrant expression has clear repercussions as to the importance of occludin in maintaining TJ integrity in breast tissues. Such inappropriate expression could play a part in breast cancer development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martin, Tracey Amanda","Mansel, Robert Edward","Jiang, Wen Guo"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.3892/ijmm_00000519","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931557,"sim:weight":0.27738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631715,"sim:weight":0.257835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222812,"sim:weight":0.251116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76866,"sim:weight":0.188387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780070,"sim:weight":0.183906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76062,"sim:weight":0.177071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76612,"sim:weight":0.172975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929888,"sim:weight":0.168744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76804,"sim:weight":0.16367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.156579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.15594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.142592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23816,"sim:weight":0.142373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.139799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76003,"sim:weight":0.125074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.118852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.118068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222792,"sim:weight":0.117934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.107919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0940872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Effectiveness to a great extent depends on the shadow of hierarchy, which is cast by the threat of legislative action and by ensuring implementation of collective agreements through public intervention. The need for the shadow is illustrated by the initial priority given to statutory agreements and the problems of implementation of more recent non-statutory agreements. While the shadow of hierarchy is important to ensure the effectiveness of social dialogue, social dialogue procedures are not characterised by strong principal-agent relationships. In particular, non-statutory agreements stem from a bottom-up private sector-inspired tradition of industrial relations. Even in the case of statutory agreements, the European Commission, as principal, does not appoint the agent and the delegation is implicit rather than explicit. Moreover, successful delegation entirely depends on whether the agents reach agreement between themselves. While the Commission could revoke delegation if Community objectives are not realised and by setting statutory criteria for implementing an agreement, its room for manoeuvre is limited for reasons of political pragmatism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smismans, Stijn"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1017/S0143814X08000822","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":700991,"sim:weight":0.346893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1644727,"sim:weight":0.288553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.213421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631263,"sim:weight":0.211474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222885,"sim:weight":0.193296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316057,"sim:weight":0.183626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.148463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":2826251,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Laws and religion: unravelling McFarlane v Relate Avon Limited","bibo:abstract":"The Labour Government (1997–2010) created a large number of new laws affecting religion. The Blair and Brown years saw the incorporation of Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law, the creation of religiously-aggravated offences, the recognition of civil partnerships, and a tide of legislation affecting education, charities and equality law, which saw the extension of the law to cover discrimination on grounds of religion or belief. And all this legislation has resulted in an abundance of case law. There is more ‘religion law’ – national and international law affecting religion – than ever before. And, for some time, there has been an implicit tension in English law between this new religion law and older laws protecting religion. These old laws, many still on the statute books, were based upon a different premise. They often sought to protect Christianity in general (or the Church of England in particular) as the norm, while providing some degree of toleration for other faiths. Moreover, the legal regulation of religion was characterised by a lightness of touch. The new religion law, by contrast, is facilitative, seeking to protect religious freedom mainly as an individual right which needs to be balanced against other rights. No special protection is afforded to any one religion and protection is often afforded to non-religious beliefs. The new legal framework affords utmost importance to the concept of religious neutrality as the State takes on the role of facilitating the religious market place. The tension between the old laws on religion and the new ‘religion law’ can be seen, for example, in the abolition of the offence of blasphemy (which favoured the Church of England in particular) and its replacement by offences concerning religious hatred (which covers all religions). This tension has recently come to the fore in the Court of Appeal ruling in the application for leave to appeal in McFarlane v Relate Avon Limited.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sandberg, Russell"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1017/S0956618X10000451","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176810,"sim:weight":0.396753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91071,"sim:weight":0.354705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85239,"sim:weight":0.33269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631095,"sim:weight":0.286566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107053,"sim:weight":0.285233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109014,"sim:weight":0.277864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77960,"sim:weight":0.275972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77596,"sim:weight":0.274135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58704,"sim:weight":0.249106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108597,"sim:weight":0.24498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266688,"sim:weight":0.225248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84868,"sim:weight":0.22494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.21999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86047,"sim:weight":0.217185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77112,"sim:weight":0.20017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108067,"sim:weight":0.195496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, tensions have emerged between laws protecting religious freedom and those which prohibit discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. In particular, Parliament has repeatedly examined the scope and ambit of exceptions afforded to religious groups which allow them to discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation when specific conditions are met. And these exceptions have reportedly led to tensions within both the Blair and Brown cabinets and rebukes from the Vatican and the European Commission, criticising the exceptions for being too narrow and too broad respectively. The exceptions have also been challenged by way of judicial review, have been applied or commented upon in a number of high-profile cases and have attracted comment in the print and broadcast media. A number of employees have brought claims asserting that new legal requirements promoting equality on grounds of sexual orientation are incompatible with their religious beliefs. This article seeks to explore the legal changes that have occurred in the first decade of the 21st century affecting religion and sexual orientation with particular reference to how courts and tribunals have dealt with clashes between the two. It discusses the extent to which English law allows religious groups and individuals to follow their own beliefs regarding human sexuality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sandberg, Russell"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1017/S0956618X11000044","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.278137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176810,"sim:weight":0.258315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107053,"sim:weight":0.256131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77960,"sim:weight":0.253666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227169,"sim:weight":0.244284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631647,"sim:weight":0.223177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1458972,"sim:weight":0.222655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85570,"sim:weight":0.215986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631095,"sim:weight":0.207562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58704,"sim:weight":0.206021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84868,"sim:weight":0.203917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.196143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.196143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86047,"sim:weight":0.195949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85632,"sim:weight":0.175423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85292,"sim:weight":0.172699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Observations suggest that low-mass stars condense out of dense, relatively isolated, molecular cloud cores, with each core spawning a small-N cluster of stars.\r\nAims. Our aim is to identify the physical processes shaping the collapse and fragmentation of a 5.4  core, and to understand how these processes influence the mass distribution, kinematics, and binary statistics of the resulting stars.\r\nMethods. We perform SPH simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of cores having different initial levels of turbulence ( \u003d 0.05, 0.10, 0.25). We use a new treatment of the energy equation that captures (i) excitation of the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of H2, dissociation of H2, ionisation of H and He; and (ii) the transport of cooling radiation against opacity due to both dust and gas (including the effects of dust sublimation, molecules, and H- ions). We also perform comparison simulations using a standard barotropic equation of state.\r\nResults. We find that – when compared with the barotropic equation of state – our more realistic treatment of the energy equation results in more protostellar objects being formed, and a higher proportion of brown dwarfs; the multiplicity frequency is essentially unchanged, but the multiple systems tend to have shorter periods (by a factor ~3), higher eccentricities, and higher mass ratios. The reason for this is that small fragments are able to cool more effectively with the new treatment, as compared with the barotropic equation of state. We also note that in our simulations the process of fragmentation is often bimodal, in the following sense. The first protostar to form is usually, at the end, the most massive, i.e. the primary. However, frequently a disc-like structure subsequently forms round this primary, and then, once it has accumulated sufficient mass, quickly fragments to produce several secondaries.\r\nConclusions. We believe that this delayed fragmentation of a disc-like structure is likely to be an important source of very low-mass stars in nature (both low-mass hydrogen-burning stars and brown dwarf stars); hence it may be fundamental to understanding the way in which the statistical properties of stars change – continuously but monotonically – with decreasing mass. However, in our simulations the individual cores probably produce too many stars, and hence too many single stars. We list the physical and numerical features that still need to be included in our simulations to make them more realistic; in particular, radiative and mechanical feedback, non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic effects, and a more sophisticated implementation of sink particles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Attwood, R.

I shall argue that post-communist states initially had to embrace the substantive concept of the rule of law drawing on liberal and democratic values, which became a valid ticket for ‘The Return to Europe’ journey. However, the very process of European integration involved technical uses of law often challenging the substantive notion of the democratic rule of law and constitutionalism.

It also provides new insight into the applicability of Vertical Flow Reactors (VFRs) to the treatment circumneutral waters.\r\nBatch-wise experiments were used to determine Fe(II) oxidation rates in the field. The data collected were used to show that values for the rate constant k1 were up to 3 orders of magnitude greater at the field sites than would be predicted from previously published laboratory studies. A methodology was also developed for determining k2 (the heterogenous oxidation rate constant) in the field.\r\nThe results of field based monitoring of aeration cascades as well as batchwise CO2 stripping experiments conducted using waters of varying chemistry were combined with geochemical modelling to demonstrate the evolution of the chemistry in these systems over time. The aeration cascades were shown to remove approximately 50% of the dissolved CO2 initially present but this was not shown to have an appreciable effect on mine water treatability. Continued removal of the residual CO2 fraction by mechanical aeration resulted in the elevation of pH by up to 2 units.\r\nTrials of pilot scale Vertical Flow Reactors (VFR) at two sites in South Wales showed that rapid decreases in bed permeability over time make these systems unsuitable for deployment in the treatment highly net alkaline waters. As a result of adverse weather conditions and other technical difficulties there was insufficient data collected to determine the performance of these systems under net acid conditions. Qualitative observations suggest however that Fe removal was taking place at a significantly higher rate than would be seen in settling lagoons under the same conditions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Geroni, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75808,"sim:weight":0.25793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29760,"sim:weight":0.254105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25847,"sim:weight":0.241198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27270,"sim:weight":0.239147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29466,"sim:weight":0.23801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631785,"sim:weight":0.204906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10937,"sim:weight":0.202313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68665,"sim:weight":0.194423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":267469,"sim:weight":0.192297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76732,"sim:weight":0.19202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53848,"sim:weight":0.187164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631512,"sim:weight":0.17479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97743,"sim:weight":0.173319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85608,"sim:weight":0.17287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.171119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631819,"sim:weight":0.150562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108734,"sim:weight":0.141818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75415,"sim:weight":0.115563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The algorithm involves neighbourhood and global search and is able to find promising solutions to complex multimodal optimisation problems. The purpose of neighbourhood search is to intensify the search effort around promising solutions, while global search is to enable avoidance of local optima.\r\nDespite numerous studies aimed at enhancing the Bees Algorithm, there have not been many attempts at studying neighbourhood search. This research investigated different kinds of neighbourhoods and their effects on neighbourhood search.\r\nFirst, the adaptive enlargement of the search neighbourhood was proposed. This idea was implemented in the Bees Algorithm and tested on a set of mathematical benchmarks. The modified algorithm was also tested on single objective engineering design problems. The experimental results obtained confirmed that the adaptive enlargement of the search neighbourhood improved the performance of the proposed algorithm.\r\nNormally, a symmetrical search neighbourhood is employed in the Bees Algorithm. As opposed to this practice, an asymmetrical search neighbourhood was tried in this work to determine the significance of neighbourhood symmetry. In addition to the mathematical benchmarks, the algorithm with an asymmetrical search neighbourhood was also tested on an engineering design problem. The analysis verified that under certain measurements of asymmetry, the proposed\r\nii\r\nalgorithm produced a similar performance as that of the Bees Algorithm. For this reason, it was concluded that users were free to employ either a symmetrical or an asymmetrical search neighbourhood in the Bees Algorithm.\r\nFinally, the combination of adaptive enlargement and reduction of the search neighbourhood was presented. In addition to the above mathematical benchmarks and engineering design problems, a multi-objective design optimisation exercise with constraints was selected to demonstrate the performance of the modified algorithm. The experimental results obtained showed that this combination was beneficial to the proposed algorithm.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ahmad, Siti"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":28021,"sim:weight":0.428099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105124,"sim:weight":0.313431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931954,"sim:weight":0.292646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.258773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5589317,"sim:weight":0.203405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.140276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Such a signal could be produced by a nearby spinning and slightly nonaxisymmetric isolated neutron star in our Galaxy. After recent improvements in the search program that yielded a 10× increase in computational efficiency, we have searched in two years of data collected during LIGO’s fifth science run and have obtained the most sensitive all-sky upper limits on gravitational-wave strain to date. Near 150 Hz our upper limit on worst-case linearly polarized strain amplitude h0 is 1×10-24, while at the high end of our frequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of 3.8×10-24 for all polarizations and sky locations. These results constitute a factor of 2 improvement upon previously published data. A new detection pipeline utilizing a loosely coherent algorithm was able to follow up weaker outliers, increasing the volume of space where signals can be detected by a factor of 10, but has not revealed any gravitational-wave signals. The pipeline has been tested for robustness with respect to deviations from the model of an isolated neutron star, such as caused by a low-mass or long-period binary companion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abadie, J.","Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Abbott, T.","Abernathy, M.","Accadia, T.","Acernese, F.","Adams, C.","Adhikari, R.","Affeldt, C.","Ajith, P.","Allen, B.","Allen,

This suggests that the form of the IMF is the result of the form of the CMF. However, most stars are thought to form in binary and multiple systems, therefore the relationship between the IMF and the CMF cannot be trivial. We test two star formation scenarios - one in which all stars form as binary or triple systems, and one in which low-mass stars form in a predominantly single mode. We show that from a log-normal CMF, similar to those observed, and expected on theoretical grounds, the model in which all stars form as multiples gives a better fit to the IMF.","bibo:AuthorList":["Goodwin, S.

It is generally presumed that the outflows from a YSO are directed close to its rotation axis (i.e. along its angular momentum vector and orthogonal to any attendant accretion disc). Many YSOs are formed from dense prestellar cores embedded in filaments, and therefore the relative orientations of outflows and filaments may place a useful constraint on the dynamics of core formation.\r\nAims. We explore this possibility, from the viewpoint of what it may tell us about the angular momentum delivered to a core forming in a filament. We stress that we are not here addressing the issue of the relationship of filaments and outflows to the prevailing magnetic field direction, although this is evidently also an interesting issue.\r\nMethods. We use data from the literature and the SCUBA archive to estimate the projected angles between 45 observed outflows and the filaments which appear to contain their driving sources. The distribution of these angles is then compared with model predictions, so as to obtain a statistical constraint on the distribution of intrinsic angles between outflows and filaments.\r\nResults. Using the limited data available, and neglecting any possible selection effects or correlations between nearby outflows, we infer that the observed outflows have a tendency to be orthogonal to the filaments that contain their driving sources. Specfically, in the cases where the directions of the filaments and outflows are well defined, we infer statistically that  of outflows are within  of being orthogonal to the filament, and only  are within  of being parallel to the filament.\r\nConclusions. This suggests that the prestellar cores which spawned the YSOs driving the observed outflows had angular momenta which were approximately orthogonal to the filaments out of which the cores formed. We briefly discuss the implications of this for two proposed core formation mechanisms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anathpindika, S.","Whitworth, Anthony Peter"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1051/0004-6361","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2305562,"sim:weight":0.23478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75618,"sim:weight":0.172784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108049,"sim:weight":0.172511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84777,"sim:weight":0.161066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.160232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780044,"sim:weight":0.154954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.149673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2309348,"sim:weight":0.149007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176870,"sim:weight":0.14866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77295,"sim:weight":0.145352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176882,"sim:weight":0.138155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86033,"sim:weight":0.130211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86037,"sim:weight":0.105434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85329,"sim:weight":0.102217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In August 2006, a timing glitch was observed in the radio emission of PSR B0833-45, the Vela pulsar. At the time of the glitch, the two colocated Hanford gravitational-wave detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) were operational and taking data as part of the fifth LIGO science run (S5). We present the first direct search for the gravitational-wave emission associated with oscillations of the fundamental quadrupole mode excited by a pulsar timing glitch. No gravitational-wave detection candidate was found. We place Bayesian 90% confidence upper limits of 6.3×10-21 to 1.4×10-20 on the peak intrinsic strain amplitude of gravitational-wave ring-down signals, depending on which spherical harmonic mode is excited. The corresponding range of energy upper limits is 5.0×1044 to 1.3×1045  erg.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abadie, J.","Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Ajith, P.","Allen, B.","Allen, G.","Amador

GIXD measurements confirm extended in-plane lamellae ordering and out-of-plane π−π stacking. Angle-resolved surface-sensitive NEXAFS measurements, however, indicate a lack of preferred in-plane or out-of-plane orientation of either the conjugated backbone or side chains at the P(NDI2OD-T2) film surface. This lack of pronounced orientation effects is attributed to a significant proportion of amorphous content in the film, with NEXAFS measurements sensitive to both amorphous and crystalline content while GIXD is sensitive only to coherent ordering. Furthermore, it is found that increased crystallinity in annealed thin films is not beneficial to the performance of top-gate bottom-contact field-effect transistors. In fact, both highly crystalline and amorphous P(NDI2OD-T2) devices exhibit similar device performance with saturation mobilities around 0.04 and 0.02 cm2/(V s), respectively, almost 1 order of magnitude lower than the high-performance devices where the pristine morphology has not been subjected to significant heat treatment. Changes in the optical absorption and Raman spectra of P(NDI2OD-T2) thin films with annealing are also presented and discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schuettfort, Torben","Huettner, Sven","Lilliu, Samuele","Macdonald, John Emyr","Thomsen, Lars","McNeill, Christopher R."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1021/ma102451b","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631529,"sim:weight":0.256472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.213058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108788,"sim:weight":0.207088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108077,"sim:weight":0.206621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85213,"sim:weight":0.206366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108118,"sim:weight":0.205794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.205649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108107,"sim:weight":0.205459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108775,"sim:weight":0.197679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84924,"sim:weight":0.196756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222993,"sim:weight":0.191364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.185252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780054,"sim:weight":0.184884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.18127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76750,"sim:weight":0.181042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26619,"sim:weight":0.180732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85806,"sim:weight":0.175015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.17123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85937,"sim:weight":0.165658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108874,"sim:weight":0.164042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We perform two directional searches for persistent GWs using data from the LIGO S5 science run: one optimized for pointlike sources and one for arbitrary extended sources. Finding no evidence to support the detection of GWs, we present 90% confidence level (C.L.) upper-limit maps of GW strain power with typical values between 2-20×10-50  strain2 Hz-1 and 5-35×10-49  strain2 Hz-1 sr-1 for pointlike and extended sources, respectively. The latter result is the first of its kind. We also set 90% C.L. limits on the narrow-band root-mean-square GW strain from interesting targets including Sco X-1, SN 1987A and the Galactic center as low as ≈7×10-25 in the most sensitive frequency range near 160 Hz.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abadie, J.","Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Abernathy, M.","Accadia, T.","Acernese, F.","Adams, C.","Adhikari, R.","Ajith, P.","Allen, B.","Allen,

{"identifier":2826705,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"A critical assessment and catalogue of the illustrated work of Ernest Aris","bibo:abstract":"Ernest Alfred Walter George Aris FZS, SGA, (1882–1963) was born in Islington and\r\nmoved to Bradford where he spent his formative years and attained a diploma at the Bradford\r\nTechnical College of Fine Art in 1900. Aris was a professionally trained commercial artist,\r\nauthor, and prolific illustrator of 170 children‟s and natural history books. He also illustrated\r\nover 250 books for other authors, including Enid Blyton, Beatrix Potter, and May Byron, as well\r\nas contributing to a number of leading periodicals, magazines and newspapers. Aris was not a\r\nmember of any of the active artists‟ clubs or societies and was possibly shunned by his\r\ncontemporaries and peers, who considered him unoriginal and an unscrupulous opportunist.\r\nVolume I of this thesis seeks to examine these suggestions and assesses why Aris‟s name,\r\ndespite his significant output, has remained relatively anonymous and why much of his legacy\r\nappears to have been unidentified, overlooked or forgotten.\r\nChapter 1 discusses the historical influences of anthropomorphism on Aris‟s style and\r\nthose of his immediate predecessors. I have categorised Aris‟s books into three periods for this\r\nappraisal and examined his technical attributes and qualities, together with his trademark\r\nfeatures and characteristics, with the purpose of identifying what makes Aris‟s creative design\r\ninstantly recognisable and his output of illustration so distinctive.\r\nChapter 2 discusses Aris‟s relationship with the children‟s author and illustrator, Beatrix\r\nPotter. Aris holds a unique place in history in that he was commissioned by Beatrix Potter to\r\nprovide illustrations for her book and was the only artist with whom she seriously contemplated\r\na professional working partnership (1916). However, Frederick Warne and Beatrix Potter later\r\naccused Aris of plagiarism and of exploiting any opportunity to achieve a commercial\r\nadvantage. There is an argument to suggest that Aris‟s affiliation with Potter and the allegations\r\n2\r\nof plagiarism had a significant impact on his long term reputation and was possibly the reason\r\nfor adopting the pseudonym Robin A. Hood.\r\nChapter 3 examines the creative scope and features of Aris’s prestigious commercial\r\npartnerships. These start from the beginning of his professional career at the turn of the\r\ntwentieth century, which coincided with the technical development and advancement of the\r\ncolour picture postcard. Aris was at the forefront of this revolution, designing several series of\r\ncomic and humorous postcards for leading printers that are now associated with and\r\nrepresentative of a bygone era. In 1915 Aris was commissioned to design six tram posters,\r\nwhich were selected by Frank Pick at London Transport, as part of the National Collection of\r\nPosters. Pick single handedly revolutionised poster art in Britain and was responsible for\r\nestablishing the national collection, where these posters now reside and have remained forgotten\r\nand out of sight for the last century. In the 1920s the trend for collecting novelty cigarette cards\r\nenabled Aris to produce a number of outstanding natural history designs as well as the infamous\r\nFrisky series, where his mischievous sense of humour is much evident in his trademark\r\ncharacters. Perhaps Aris’s final and greatest legacy, however, lies in the legendary Cococubs\r\ncampaign for Bournville Children’s Cocoa, which was described as ‘one of the cleverest\r\npublicity schemes of the year.’1 The success of the advertising campaign meant demand\r\noutstripped supply of the product, as youngsters eagerly sought the ‘free toy in every tin’\r\npromotional figurines that Aris designed (1934-1936).\r\nVolume II of this thesis comprises a unique catalogue of Aris’s creative output over\r\nfifty years and spans a range of commercial fields of art. The catalogue is divided into four parts.\r\nPart one consists of Aris’s literary publications, with a detailed bibliographic record and image\r\nof the cover of each book that he wrote and illustrated under his own name and pseudonyms, as\r\n1 The Grocery and the Provision Merchant Journal, November 1934, p. 276.\r\n3\r\nwell as prominent books Aris illustrated for other eminent authors and a compendium list of\r\nbooks Aris illustrated for authors and other publications. Part two is a record of Aris‟s\r\ncommercial work, including the early series of pictorial postcards that he completed for leading\r\nquality publishers at the start of his career (1904-1909) and the six pictorial natural history\r\nposters, which Aris was commissioned to undertake for the London Transport tram system\r\n(1915). Part three comprises of Aris‟s collectables and contains the four unique series of\r\ncigarette cards that Aris designed for leading tobacco manufacturers (issued 1929-1935). Part\r\nfour includes a comprehensive description of each of the limited editions and subtle colour\r\nvariants of the Cococub lead figurines inserted into Bournville Children‟s Cocoa (1934-1936).\r\nThe aim of the thesis is to justify why I believe Aris deserves further merit for his\r\ncontribution within the field of illustration and commercial artwork. I have sought to highlight\r\nthe factors that make his contribution and the success of his creative designs within these\r\ndifferent fields so significant.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dawson, Sian"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108601,"sim:weight":0.267696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.255093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75972,"sim:weight":0.222831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388777,"sim:weight":0.221986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631090,"sim:weight":0.218859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75041,"sim:weight":0.21361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75568,"sim:weight":0.197255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76482,"sim:weight":0.180862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.157787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631447,"sim:weight":0.151139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222816,"sim:weight":0.140465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This\r\nrecommendation is made on the basis that the ecocritical turn has neglected to apprise itself\r\nof a thoroughgoing prehistory; by bringing together the lessons of Marx and Lacan, post-\r\nAlthusserian thinking enables us to address the disavowal of formal and theoretical concerns\r\nconstitutive of first-wave ecocriticism, and to acknowledge this as symptomatic of North\r\nAmerican cultural and political pluralism more broadly. Where such disavowal promoted a\r\nwidespread rejection of poststructural theories of immanence in the Americanist milieu of\r\nthe 1980s, we consider how it effectively blocked psychoanalytic and Marxist approaches to\r\nliterary form and human subjectivity.\r\nFollowing an initial examination of ecocriticism after Althusser and Balibar’s thesis on\r\n‘symptomnal reading’, our study goes on to reassert issues of subjectivity for ecocriticism.\r\nŽižek’s subjectivist approach to ideology critique therefore enables us to diagnose the legacy\r\nof modern epistemology and thereafter to analyse ecocritical motivations of sublime\r\naesthetics. By pursuing broader, ‘valetudinary’ issues in relation to literary form, the latter\r\nhalf of the thesis exceeds the former’s emphasis on ideology critique, moving to engage the\r\npost-subjectivist, ‘stratoanalytic’ project of Deleuze and Guattari. Predicated upon an asubjective\r\nphilosophy of differential relations, stratoanalysis suggests an ecological\r\nextension of ‘schizoanalysis’, enabling us to reappraise eco-literary and eco-philosophical\r\nconcerns, chiefly after post-symptomatological analyses of the relationship between high\r\nmodern literature, pre-personal affect and the ‘eco-social’ coding of desire. It is in this way\r\nthat we assert the ‘body without organs’ as the privileged clinical figure with which to\r\naddress eco-social organisation, and thus, exceed the subjectivist logic of the symptom.","bibo:AuthorList":["Matts, Timothy"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.228072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.220566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An agent-based control system that coordinates the battery\r\ncharging of electric vehicles according to electric vehicle owner preferences,\r\ndistribution network technical limits and electricity prices was designed and\r\ndeveloped and its operation was tested experimentally.\r\nThe impact on grid demand peak increases at the national systems of Great Britain\r\nand Spain was evaluated using low and high electric vehicle uptake levels of 7% and\r\n48.5% of the car fleet for the year 2030 with a deterministic method. It was found that\r\na low uptake will not raise significantly the grid demand peaks in both countries under\r\ninvestigation. However, a high uptake will raise significantly the grid demand peaks.\r\nThe impact from residential electric vehicle battery charging on steady state voltages,\r\npower line losses, transformers’ and cables’ loadings of distribution networks was\r\nevaluated using a deterministic and a probabilistic method. It was found that low and\r\nmedium uptake levels of electric vehicles equivalent to 12.5% and 33% per residential\r\narea of 384 customers in 2030, can be safely accommodated by reinforcing the\r\ndistribution network. A combination of reinforcements, installation of microgenerators\r\nand control of electric vehicle battery charging will be required to\r\naccommodate safely a high uptake of 71% with regards to the constraints studied.\r\nAn agent-based control system that coordinates the battery charging of electric\r\nvehicles was designed and developed. Search techniques and neural networks were\r\nused for the decision making processes. The ability of the agent-based control system\r\nto operate successfully in both normal and abnormal conditions for the electrical\r\nnetwork was proved with experimental validation in the laboratory of Tecnalia\r\nresearch institute in Spain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Papadopoulos, Panagiotis"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":33709,"sim:weight":0.405497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28485,"sim:weight":0.346438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84850,"sim:weight":0.278579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75791,"sim:weight":0.254552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15430,"sim:weight":0.250803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86097,"sim:weight":0.249585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1511648,"sim:weight":0.238702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931539,"sim:weight":0.238535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848549,"sim:weight":0.230746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85296,"sim:weight":0.220856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108846,"sim:weight":0.206549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.194366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108453,"sim:weight":0.186364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386659,"sim:weight":0.181208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76812,"sim:weight":0.154613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77077,"sim:weight":0.154213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108096,"sim:weight":0.138245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100346,"sim:weight":0.132042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107003,"sim:weight":0.131226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An EM counterpart could increase the confidence of the GW detection and provide insight into the nature of the source. Current GW-EM campaigns target potential host galaxies based on overlap with the GW sky error box. We propose a new statistic to identify the most likely host galaxy, ranking galaxies based on their position, distance, and luminosity. We test our statistic with Monte Carlo simulations of GWs produced by coalescing binaries of neutron stars and black holes, one of the most promising sources for ground-based GW detectors. Considering signals accessible to current detectors, we find that when imaging a single galaxy, our statistic correctly identifies the true host ∼20% to ∼50% of the time, depending on the masses of the binary components. With five narrow-field images the probability of imaging the true host increases from ∼50% to ∼80%. When collectively imaging groups of galaxies using large field-of-view telescopes, the probability improves from ∼30% to ∼60% for a single image and from ∼70% to ∼90% for five images. For the advanced generation of detectors (circa 2015+), and considering binaries within 100 Mpc (the reach of the galaxy catalogue used), the probability is ∼40% for one narrow-field image, ∼75% for five narrow-field images, ∼65% for one wide-field image, and ∼95% for five wide-field images, irrespective of binary type.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nuttall, Laura","Sutton, Patrick J."],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.82.102002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77867,"sim:weight":0.305809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77333,"sim:weight":0.301693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75618,"sim:weight":0.290758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631672,"sim:weight":0.238809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109168,"sim:weight":0.229441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631466,"sim:weight":0.202549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222902,"sim:weight":0.191865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.189362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85346,"sim:weight":0.18563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631516,"sim:weight":0.178811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This suggested that the overall surface morphology of each bioNP could be controlled by the degree of metal loading but that no enantiomeric excess of intrinsically chiral surface kink sites was present.","bibo:AuthorList":["Attard, Gary Anthony","Casadesus, Meritxell","Macaskie, Lynne E.","Deplanche, Kevin"],"dc:date":"2012","doi":"10.1021/la204495z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1563937,"sim:weight":0.36844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.323107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75562,"sim:weight":0.281963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76938,"sim:weight":0.265301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10835,"sim:weight":0.255586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631579,"sim:weight":0.238809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631911,"sim:weight":0.2249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76556,"sim:weight":0.214742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108050,"sim:weight":0.211159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77276,"sim:weight":0.191727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75677,"sim:weight":0.184227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75445,"sim:weight":0.179436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222852,"sim:weight":0.176217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76244,"sim:weight":0.15451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24401,"sim:weight":0.151164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1563556,"sim:weight":0.148403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1563922,"sim:weight":0.148403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108030,"sim:weight":0.140921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769344,"sim:weight":0.139164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10924,"sim:weight":0.137598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We aim to demonstrate that the Herschel-ATLAS (H-ATLAS) is suitable for a blind and unbiased survey for debris disks by identifying candidate debris disks associated with main sequence stars in the initial science demonstration field of the survey. We show that H-ATLAS reveals a population of far-infrared/sub-mm sources that are associated with stars or star-like objects on the SDSS main-sequence locus. We validate our approach by comparing the properties of the most likely candidate disks to those of the known population.\r\n\r\nMethods. We use a photometric selection technique to identify main sequence stars in the SDSS DR7 catalogue and a Bayesian Likelihood Ratio method to identify H-ATLAS catalogue sources associated with these main sequence stars. Following this photometric selection we apply distance cuts to identify the most likely candidate debris disks and rule out the presence of contaminating galaxies using UKIDSS LAS K-band images.\r\n\r\nResults. We identify 78 H-ATLAS sources associated with SDSS point sources on the main-sequence locus, of which two are the most likely debris disk candidates: H-ATLAS J090315.8 and H-ATLAS J090240.2. We show that they are plausible candidates by comparing their properties to the known population of debris disks. Our initial results indicate that bright debris disks are rare, with only 2 candidates identified in a search sample of 851 stars. We also show that H-ATLAS can derive useful upper limits for debris disks associated with Hipparcos stars in the field and outline the future prospects for our debris disk search programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thompson, M.

The VSC-HVDC provides a number of potential advantages over the conventional HVDC, such as rapid and independent control of reactive and active power, black-start capability and no restriction on multiple infeeds. Therefore, VSC-HVDC will likely to be widely used in the future transmission networks and for offshore wind power connections. Multi-terminal VSC-HVDC (VSC-MTDC) system, which consists of more than two voltage source converter stations connecting together through a DC link, is able to increase the flexibility and reliability of transmission systems. It allows connection of multiple offshore wind farms to the AC grid.\r\nIn this thesis, a three-terminal MTDC system was investigated using simulations and experiments. MTDC system with its control was implemented in PSCAD/EMTDC. The control strategy developed through simulation was verified using experiments. The results of PSCAD/EMTDC simulation and laboratory demonstration were then compared. Additionally, a scenario of four-terminal MTDC transmission system for\r\nModelling and Control of Multi-Terminal HVDC Networks for Offshore Wind Power Generation\r\nIV\r\noffshore wind power generation was investigated. A control system was designed considering the operating characteristics of VSCs and wind farms. An open loop control method was used for the wind farm side VSCs to establish a constant AC voltage and frequency. Droop control was used for the grid side VSCs to generate DC voltage reference by measuring the DC current. When the system was under fault operation condition, the output power of wind farm was reduced by reducing the DC voltage reference. Simulation results show that good coordination was achieved among VSCs for voltage control and power sharing. The system is able to recover to the normal operation status automatically when subjected to AC balanced fault (three phase fault) and unbalanced fault (single phase fault) on the grid.\r\nKeywords: control system, modelling, MTDC, Multi-terminal, offshore, VSC-HVDC, wind power generation","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhou, Shu"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66742,"sim:weight":0.576279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844367,"sim:weight":0.523574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5845007,"sim:weight":0.369347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108038,"sim:weight":0.365699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108810,"sim:weight":0.339597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108820,"sim:weight":0.316362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85296,"sim:weight":0.313699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84850,"sim:weight":0.293416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66363,"sim:weight":0.280795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176817,"sim:weight":0.271935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734349,"sim:weight":0.244075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512829,"sim:weight":0.234817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77077,"sim:weight":0.229555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86028,"sim:weight":0.223298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.171057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The search is performed by three different analysis algorithms over the frequency band 50–6000 Hz. Data are analyzed for times with at least two of the four LIGO-Virgo detectors in coincident operation, with a total live time of 266 days. No events produced by the search algorithms survive the selection cuts. We set a frequentist upper limit on the rate of gravitational-wave bursts impinging on our network of detectors. When combined with the previous LIGO search of the data collected between November 2005 and November 2006, the upper limit on the rate of detectable gravitational-wave bursts in the 64–2048 Hz band is 2.0 events per year at 90% confidence. We also present event rate versus strength exclusion plots for several types of plausible burst waveforms. The sensitivity of the combined search is expressed in terms of the root-sum-squared strain amplitude for a variety of simulated waveforms and lies in the range 6×10-22  Hz-1/2 to 2×10-20  Hz-1/2. This is the first untriggered burst search to use data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors together, and the most sensitive untriggered burst search performed so far.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abadie, J.","Abbott, B.

We have compared and contrasted various methods of RNA preparation, RNA amplification, target labelling and array analysis in order to achieve a streamlined protocol for microarraying small samples. We have concluded that usage of the NIA 15K cDNA array set, in combination with RNA extraction using the Mini RNA Isolation kit (Zymo), amplification with the RiboAmp kit (Arcturus), followed by indirect labelling via the Atlas™ PowerScript™ Fluorescent Labelling kit (using a modified protocol), is optimal with a material derived from either very early stage mouse embryos or individually picked embryonic stem cell colonies. Normalisation using the analysis package Limma (Bioconductor) with data normalisation by print tip Loess, using the “normexp” function with an offset of 50 for background adjustment, and incorporating A-quantile between array normalisation was best with our results. Furthermore, RT-PCR confirmation of array results is achievable without amplification, thereby controlling for amplification bias. These methods will be of great utility in mapping the transcriptome of embryonic and other small samples.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hunter, Susan MacLean","Mansergh, Fiona","Evans, Martin John"],"dc:date":"2008-04","doi":"10.1016/j.jprot.2007.11.011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":20529,"sim:weight":0.218635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25913,"sim:weight":0.198717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26334,"sim:weight":0.193547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316476,"sim:weight":0.189585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.16806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76821,"sim:weight":0.165162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24013,"sim:weight":0.162683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26919,"sim:weight":0.160617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.157628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.150691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75816,"sim:weight":0.142378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631986,"sim:weight":0.142146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222881,"sim:weight":0.140753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75579,"sim:weight":0.137808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77267,"sim:weight":0.134662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76242,"sim:weight":0.127632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631506,"sim:weight":0.126529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.121675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75588,"sim:weight":0.121429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.121301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Five months of data were collected during the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory’s S5 and Virgo’s VSR1 science runs. The search focused on signals from binary mergers with a total mass between 2 and 35M⊙. No gravitational waves are identified. The cumulative 90%-confidence upper limits on the rate of compact binary coalescence are calculated for nonspinning binary neutron stars, black hole-neutron star systems, and binary black holes to be 8.7×10-3  yr-1 L10-1, 2.2×10-3  yr-1 L10-1, and 4.4×10-4  yr-1 L10-1, respectively, where L10 is 1010 times the blue solar luminosity. These upper limits are compared with astrophysical expectations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abadie, J.","Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Abernathy, M.","Accadia, T.","Acernese, F.","Adams, C.","Adhikari,

Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a number of assumptions and unknown model parameters and are still uncertain. The most confident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary neutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in our galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 Myr−1 per Milky Way Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 Myr−1 MWEG−1 to 1000 Myr−1 MWEG−1 (Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 601 L179; Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 614 L137 (erratum)). We convert coalescence rates into detection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and projected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. Using the detector sensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02 per year for Initial LIGO–Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between 2 × 10−4 and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutron–star detection rate for the Advanced LIGO–Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range between 0.4 and 400 per year.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abadie, J.","Abbott, B.

In some experiments, one makes several counts of the number of events, using different instruments, different event detection algorithms or observations over multiple time intervals. We demonstrate how to generalize the classical frequentist upper limit calculation to the case where multiple counts of events are made over one or more time intervals using several (not necessarily independent) procedures. We show how different choices of the rank ordering of possible outcomes in the space of counts correspond to applying different levels of significance to the various measurements. We propose an ordering that is matched to the sensitivity of the different measurement procedures and show that in typical cases it gives stronger upper limits than other choices. As an example, we show how this method can be applied to searches for gravitational-wave bursts, where multiple burst-detection algorithms analyse the same data set, and demonstrate how a single combined upper limit can be set on the gravitational-wave burst rate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sutton, Patrick J."],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1088/0264-9381","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.212504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.208308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70101,"sim:weight":0.206851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631516,"sim:weight":0.187311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77172,"sim:weight":0.180754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631466,"sim:weight":0.173329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269862,"sim:weight":0.152649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75992,"sim:weight":0.138428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The purpose of the NRDA meetings is to bring together two communities with a vested interest in gravitational-wave observations: the data analysis and numerical relativity communities. The first NRDA meeting was held in November 2006 at MIT. A quote of Peter Saulson\u0027s from the Matters of Gravity Newsletter puts the importance of the NRDA meetings in perspective. He wrote: `As I sat in the back row of Rm NW14-1112 at MIT on Tuesday 7 November 2006, it suddenly struck me that we were participating in a watershed moment in the history of gravitational physics. Here, in the same room, were two communities who decades earlier had promised to help each other in a grand adventure: the detection of gravitational waves and the use of those waves to explore the frontiers of strong field gravity.\u0027 That meeting marked the first time when the two communities began to speak each other\u0027s language.\r\nBy the time of the second NRDA meeting, much progress had been made. Numerical relativists were starting to explore the binary-black-hole parameter space and were making advances in evolutions of neutron-star and neutron-star/black-hole binaries. Data analysts were investigating better algorithms for the detection of both inspiral and burst sources. Most importantly, on 14 August 2008, someone sitting in the back row of the Stolkin Auditorium in Syracuse University might have noted the beginning of real collaborations between the two communities. The meeting included presentations based on joint work by numerical relativists and data analysts. Also the participants at NRDA2008 asked tough questions about how to best use numerical relativity in gravitational wave detection, as well as showcasing some of the science that will allow us to formulate the answers to these questions.\r\nThis issue presents many of the highlights of the meeting. These include an article that summarizes the NINJA project, a collaboration between data analysts and numerical relativists that is testing data analysis pipelines on numerical relativity waveforms buried in simulated detector noise. In addition, there are several technical papers concerning the results of team efforts involved in NINJA. Also included is a review of the status of black-hole simulations, updates on black-hole and neutron-star sources of gravitational waves, accuracy tests of gravitational waveforms, binary parameter estimation methods, updates on searches using analytic and phenomenological waveforms, and a road map to the advanced LIGO detectors.\r\nThe conference organizers would like to acknowledge the financial support of the National Science Foundation under grant number PHY-0838740, and support from Syracuse University. We thank the local organizing committee of Duncan Brown, Penny Davis and Joshua Smith as well as the other members of the scientific organizing committee of Duncan Brown (Syracuse University), Sascha Husa (AEI), Badri Krishnan (AEI) and Harald Pfeiffer (CITA) for putting together an exciting conference. We also thank the editorial staff of the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity, especially Adam Day, Suzanne Prescott, and Joseph Tennant for their assistance, support, and patience in preparing this issue. Finally, we would like to thank the participants of NRDA2008 for making this conference so vital and energizing.\r\nThe next NRDA meeting will be held at the Albert Einstein Institute in Potsdam, Germany 6–9 July 2009. We look forward to new collaborations, and to the continued blurring of the lines between our communities as we explore the interface of numerical relativity and data analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sutton, Patrick J.","Shoemaker, Deirdre"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1088/0264-9381","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24225,"sim:weight":0.345953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.262673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87043,"sim:weight":0.261762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.248568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.248198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.235163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.229216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.223761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.218064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.218064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.19237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.184021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631476,"sim:weight":0.115237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This type of analysis makes use of GRB time and position information from gamma-ray satellite detectors to trigger the GWB search, and the GWB detection rates possible for such an analysis thus strongly depend on the GRB detection efficiencies of the satellite detectors. Using local GRB rate densities inferred from observations which are found in the science literature, we calculate estimates of the GWB detection rates for different configurations of the LIGO–Virgo network for this type of analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Leonor, I.","Sutton, Patrick J.","Frey, R.","Jones, Gareth","Márka, S.","Márka, Z."],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1088/0264-9381","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5847318,"sim:weight":0.364639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Depending on the mass, we are sensitive to coalescences as far as 150 Mpc from the Earth. No gravitational-wave signals were observed above the expected background. Assuming a population of compact binary objects with a Gaussian mass distribution representing binary neutron star systems, black hole–neutron star binary systems, and binary black hole systems, we calculate the 90% confidence upper limit on the rate of coalescences to be 3.9×10-2  yr-1L10-1, 1.1×10-2  yr-1L10-1, and 2.5×10-3  yr-1L10-1, respectively, where L10 is 1010 times the blue solar luminosity. We also set improved upper limits on the rate of compact binary coalescences per unit blue-light luminosity, as a function of mass.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Ajith,

LIGO, a joint Caltech–MIT project supported by the National Science Foundation, operates three multi-kilometer interferometers at two widely separated sites in the United States. These detectors are the result of decades of worldwide technology development, design, construction and commissioning.

The SPIRE spectrometer and photometer aboard the spacecraft operate\r\nin the ~ 200 - 600�m range and are well suited to probe the cold, dusty environments\r\nin molecular clouds where prestellar cores reside. The SPIRE FTS spectrometer is an\r\ninterferometer, and this instrument design has strengths and weaknesses which are im-\r\nportant to understand when using data from the instrument. Herschel is set to continue\r\ngroundbreaking work in the infrared, building upon earlier work from ISO, IRAS, and\r\nSPITZER, probing deep into star forming regions and improving our knowledge of the\r\nprocesses within.\r\nIn this PhD thesis, we outline the current body of knowledge in low mass star\r\nformation. We examine the properties of the SPIRE FTS as a spectrometerusing a small,\r\nlaboratory designed desktop FTS. We study the intrinsic properties of the instrument, as\r\na way of understanding issues we are likely to see when using the SPIRE FTS in \r\night.\r\nWith these issues firmly in mind, we examine the creation and use of SLIDE - an\r\ninteractive IDL-based tool for processing SPIRE FTS data. SLIDE can extract line and\r\ncontinuum information from SPIRE FTS SEDs. We outline the creation, testing and use\r\nof SLIDE and provide examples of the use of SLIDE in astronomy with some examples\r\nfrom the literature.\r\nWe then use the line information we extract from a variety of sources with the\r\nspectrometer, to examine how SED fitting from photometer data could be affected by\r\nline contamination. We simulate a wide range of greybodies with noise and line con-\r\ntamination and examine how SED fitting is affected. Our simulations conclude that line\r\ncontamination is not enough to affect the recovery of temperature and spectral index B\r\nsignificantly.\r\nFinally we use the information we have deduced to examine SPIRE FTS SEDs of\r\nL1689B - a prestellar core located in Ophiuchus. Our SED fitting of the core confirms\r\nthat this core is starless with no internal heating source, and the spectral index profile\r\nover the core morphology is consistent with an increasing density of fractal aggregrate\r\ngrains towards the centre. The increase in grain density and spectral index profile is also\r\nin agreement with previous CO depletion data. Fractal grain growth of this nature is\r\nconsistent with dust grain models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rykala, Adam"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2309709,"sim:weight":0.289357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11279,"sim:weight":0.225278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631466,"sim:weight":0.165871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2309244,"sim:weight":0.161742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85761,"sim:weight":0.159816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2299140,"sim:weight":0.148495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66508,"sim:weight":0.135501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85346,"sim:weight":0.133703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85597,"sim:weight":0.127701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75690,"sim:weight":0.122382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is hypothesised that retinal ganglion cell loss accelerates the loss of surrounding cells to generate, at a local, cellular scale, clustered patterns of retinal of RGC death. The absence of these interactions would result in a diffuse pattern RGC loss.\r\n\r\nMethod: Six glaucomatous retinas (67–83 years old) and six age-matched control retinas (61–89 years old) were prepared as wholemounts and stained by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution (3 μg/ml in PBS). An area corresponding to central 14° of the visual field was imaged. The nearest-neighbour distribution was determined for cells in both normal and glaucomatous RGCL.\r\n\r\nResults: Clustered RGC loss in human glaucoma was observed on a background of diffuse loss. The mean nearest-neighbour distance (NND) of the glaucomatous retinas was significantly higher than with controls (p\u003c0.001). The distribution of NND in glaucomatous retinas was skewed to the higher values with a higher positive kurtosis relative to controls. The quantitative analysis of the pattern of cell loss is supported by the visual inspection of the patterns of cell loss.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: The nearest-neighbour analysis is consistent with the presence of two patterns of cell loss in the RGCL in glaucoma. While the diffuse of cell loss can account for an overall reduction in the RGC population, an additional non-random pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that RGC loss has a local influence on the viability of surrounding cells.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lei, Yuan","Garrahan, Nigel John","Hermann, Boris","Fautsch, M.

However, the degree to which this results in transretinal degeneration is unclear. To address this, the authors used multiphoton microscopy to quantify retinal degeneration in post-mortem human eyes of two age groups.\r\n\r\nMethods Retinas from six young subjects (18–33 years old) and six older subjects (74–90 years old) were prepared as wholemount preparations. All retinas were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and imaged by multiphoton confocal microscopy to quantify neuron densities in the retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL), inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL). Neurons were counted using automated cell identification algorithms. All retinas were imaged hydrated to minimise tissue artefacts.\r\n\r\nResults In both groups, 56% of the area within the central 4 mm eccentricity and 27% of the area with eccentricity between 4 mm and 7 mm were imaged. Compared with young subjects, the peak RGCL neuron loss in the aged subjects (25.5%) was at 1 mm eccentricity. INL and ONL neuron densities significantly decreased at 1–2 mm eccentricity (8.7%) and 0.5–4 mm eccentricity (15.6%) respectively (P \u003c0.05). The reduction in neuron density in the INL corresponded, spatially, to the region with the greatest neuron loss in the RGCL and ONL.\r\n\r\nConclusions This is the first study to correlate neurodegeneration in different populations of cells in the ageing retinas. These data confirm that the greatest neuronal loss occurs in the RGCL and ONL in human ageing retinas, whereas the INL is relatively preserved.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lei, Yuan","Garrahan, Nigel John","Hermann, Boris","Fautsch, M.

The model puts decision making in the hands of families with professionals as resources in cases where the welfare of children was concerned.  As a relatively new intervention, the model has undergone a range of scrutiny and discussion.  This research project was set up to develop an evaluation tool that was then used in number of projects across Wales.  \r\n\r\nIn line with FGC philosophy, the views of users of FGC services (families, referrers and FGC workers) were sought in developing the tool.  An audit of evaluation carried out by FGC services in Wales and England was undertaken to inform semi-structured interviews with a range of participants involved in FGCs.

Such a perturbation will occur, for example, in the coalescence of a black hole binary, following their inspiral and subsequent merger. At late times the waveform is a superposition of quasinormal modes, which we refer to as the ringdown. The dominant mode is expected to be the fundamental mode, l\u003dm\u003d2. Since this is a well-known waveform, matched filtering can be implemented to search for this signal using LIGO data. We present a search for gravitational waves from black hole ringdowns in the fourth LIGO science run S4, during which LIGO was sensitive to the dominant mode of perturbed black holes with masses in the range of 10M⊙ to 500M⊙, the regime of intermediate-mass black holes, to distances up to 300 Mpc. We present a search for gravitational waves from black hole ringdowns using data from S4. No gravitational wave candidates were found; we place a 90%-confidence upper limit on the rate of ringdowns from black holes with mass between 85M⊙ and 390M⊙ in the local universe, assuming a uniform distribution of sources, of 3.2×10-5  yr-1 Mpc-3\u003d1.6×10-3  yr-1L10-1,where L10 is 1010 times the solar blue-light luminosity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Ajith,

It is proposed that infarct limitation is afforded by elevating cGMP and activating protein kinase G and its distal targets.\r\nIt was hypothesised that increasing the activity of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) would limit myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Primarily using the rat isolated perfused heart method, the experiments reported in this thesis investigate the role of exogenous targeting of sGC during early reperfusion, specifically exploring targeting different redox states of the enzyme and their effects on myocardial infarct size. The novel sGC stimulator BAY 41-2272 and activator BAY 60-2770 were selected to investigate this hypothesis.\r\nBoth administration of BAY 41-2272 and BAY 60-2770 during early reperfusion significantly limited infarct size compared to controls. This was associated with elevated total tissue cGMP levels. Inhibition of nitric oxide could not completely abrogate this protection, but exogenous perfusion of nitric oxide along with BAY 41-2272 showed synergistic action. Oxidation of the prosthetic haem group by ODQ abrogated the protection afforded by BAY 41-2272 but potentiated the protection afforded by BAY 60-2770. Targeting both the reduced and oxidised forms of sGC together did not afford additive protection, in fact it reduced the protection afforded compared to the individual treatments. Preliminary data also suggest that targeting the particulate form of guanylyl cyclase increases activity of Akt signalling during early reperfusion suggesting common signalling between soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclase.\r\nThese data suggest that targeting sGC during early reperfusion can afford cardioprotection by limiting infarct size. The relationship between cGMP elevation and infarct size needs to be investigated further. Nevertheless, these studies suggest that sGC may be a tractable target for the therapeutic management of acute myocardial infarction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bice, Justin"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1394939,"sim:weight":0.290989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844230,"sim:weight":0.269031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10942,"sim:weight":0.204386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76491,"sim:weight":0.195314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107063,"sim:weight":0.155667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77259,"sim:weight":0.138527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10945,"sim:weight":0.134831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44579,"sim:weight":0.127095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76135,"sim:weight":0.12231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631895,"sim:weight":0.115074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632043,"sim:weight":0.106744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.0917093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77510,"sim:weight":0.0912569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76719,"sim:weight":0.090516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222958,"sim:weight":0.0882714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75441,"sim:weight":0.0865287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631743,"sim:weight":0.0861503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77174,"sim:weight":0.0772656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76079,"sim:weight":0.0761552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631544,"sim:weight":0.0759532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We supplement this data with a compilation of data from IRAS, ISO, Spitzer, SCUBA and MAMBO. H-ATLAS alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at \u003e5σ at 250,350 and 500 μm. From the compilation as a whole we find striking evidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasars with absolute magnitudes in the range -22 \u003e IAB \u003e -24 have a comoving star formation rate (derived from 100 μm rest-frame luminosities) peaking between redshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with IAB \u003c -26 have a maximum contribution to the star formation density at z ~ 3. The volume-averaged star formation rate of -22 \u003e IAB \u003e -24 quasars evolves as (1 + z)2.3±0.7 at z \u003c 2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1 + z)10±1 at -26 \u003e IAB \u003e -28.

This paper examines the accounting dimension of reforms designed to achieve enhanced administrative efficiency and greater economy in the operation of government departments. A growing interest in the role of accounting within British government during the second quarter of the nineteenth century is elucidated, and prevailing ideas concerning how accounting within government departments and accountability from the executive to parliament might be performed more efficiently and effectively are uncovered. The battle between divergent pressure groups concerning who should possess jurisdiction over accounting work is explored, and the solution to this problematic is found to connect with the nature of a central government accounting system that was itself undergoing significant change. Consistency between the Northcote–Trevelyan recommendations and ongoing internal initiatives designed to ensure the competence of clerks recruited to undertake accounting work and subsequently applying for promotion to a higher grade is demonstrated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edwards, John Richard"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2011.02.001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76506,"sim:weight":0.225379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929879,"sim:weight":0.223574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108921,"sim:weight":0.215647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.210994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109159,"sim:weight":0.20819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222885,"sim:weight":0.205963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316057,"sim:weight":0.199716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631884,"sim:weight":0.19548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106931,"sim:weight":0.191731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.182283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75350,"sim:weight":0.178166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108898,"sim:weight":0.15556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.154365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.153256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Data from the first eight months of the fifth LIGO science run (S5) have been used in this search, which is based on a semicoherent method (PowerFlux) of summing strain power. Observing no evidence of periodic gravitational radiation, we report 95% confidence-level upper limits on radiation emitted by any unknown isolated rotating neutron stars within the search range. Strain limits below 10-24 are obtained over a 200-Hz band, and the sensitivity improvement over previous searches increases the spatial volume sampled by an average factor of about 100 over the entire search band. For a neutron star with nominal equatorial ellipticity of 10-6, the search is sensitive to distances as great as 500 pc.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Ajith,

The detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) operate within a factor of 10 of the standard quantum limit (SQL), providing a displacement sensitivity of 10−18 m in a 100 Hz band centered on 150 Hz. With a new feedback strategy, we dynamically shift the resonant frequency of a 2.7 kg pendulum mode to lie within this optimal band, where its effective temperature falls as low as 1.4 μK, and its occupation number reaches about 200 quanta. This work shows how the exquisite sensitivity necessary to detect gravitational waves can be made available to probe the validity of quantum mechanics on an enormous mass scale.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Ajith, P.","Allen, B.","Allen, G.","Amin, R.","Anderson, S.

This paper describes a coincident gravitational wave burst search, where data from the LIGO interferometers are cross-correlated at the time of AURIGA candidate events to identify coincident transients. The analysis pipeline is tuned with two thresholds, on the signal-to-noise ratio of AURIGA candidate events and on the significance of the cross-correlation test in LIGO. The false alarm rate is estimated by introducing time shifts between data sets and the network detection efficiency is measured by adding simulated gravitational wave signals to the detector output. The simulated waveforms have a significant fraction of power in the narrower AURIGA band. In the absence of a detection, we discuss how to set an upper limit on the rate of gravitational waves and to interpret it according to different source models. Due to the short amount of analyzed data and to the high rate of non-Gaussian transients in the detectors\u0027 noise at the time, the relevance of this study is methodological: this was the first joint search for gravitational wave bursts among detectors with such different spectral sensitivity and the first opportunity for the resonant and interferometric communities to unify languages and techniques in the pursuit of their common goal.","bibo:AuthorList":["Baggio, L.","Bignotto, M.","Bonaldi, M.","Cerdonio, M.","De Rosa, M.","Falferi, P.","Fattori, S.","Fortini, P.","Giusfredi, G.","Inguscio, M.","Liguori, N.","Longo, S.","Marin, F.","Mezzena, R.","Mion, A.","Ortolan, A.","Poggi, S.","Prodi, G.

The astrophysical triggers, e.g. from γ-ray and x-ray satellites, optical telescopes and neutrino observatories, provide a trigger time for analyzing gravitational-wave data coincident with the event. In certain cases the expected frequency range, source energetics, directional and progenitor information are also available. Beyond allowing the recognition of gravitational waveforms with amplitudes closer to the noise floor of the detector, these triggered searches should also lead to rich science results even before the onset of Advanced LIGO. In this paper we provide a broad review of LIGO\u0027s astrophysically triggered searches and the sources they target.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Ajith, P.","Allen, B.","Allen, G.","Amin, R.","Anderson, S.

We found two blazars, both previously known. Our study is among the first blind blazar searches at sub-mm wavelengths, i.e., in the spectral regime where little is still known about the blazar SEDs, but where the synchrotron peak of the most luminous blazars is expected to occur. Our early results are consistent with educated extrapolations of lower frequency counts and question indications of substantial spectral curvature downwards and of spectral upturns at mm wavelengths. One of the two blazars is identified with a Fermi/LAT γ-ray source and a WMAP source. The physical parameters of the two blazars are briefly discussed. These observations demonstrate that the H-ATLAS survey will provide key information about the physics of blazars and their contribution to sub-mm counts.","bibo:AuthorList":["González-Nuevo, J.","De Zotti, G.","Andreani, P.","Barton, E.

Findings also show how managerial quality and differences in organizational staff can affect this relationship.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hicklin, Alisa","O\u0027Toole, Laurence J.","Meier, Kenneth John"],"dc:date":"2007","doi":"10.1093/jopart","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77949,"sim:weight":0.315208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.265545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108259,"sim:weight":0.261316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76212,"sim:weight":0.248167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654023,"sim:weight":0.238032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106927,"sim:weight":0.214285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109137,"sim:weight":0.210021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75350,"sim:weight":0.193328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66220,"sim:weight":0.187195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107139,"sim:weight":0.177979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51534,"sim:weight":0.156621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It may be a quiet revolution, but a growing body of scholarship illustrates a perceived need for a rethink of the scope of the field and the approaches and priorities that have carried bioethicists through many heady years of success. Few areas of bioethical practice have been left unexamined, ranging from questions as to the sustainability of the discipline in its current form to the “expertise” of its practitioners; the legitimacy of bioethics in the realms of policymaking; its relationship to philosophy; the purchase of empirical and interdisciplinary method; the relationship of bioethics to the real world; bioethical understandings of the concept of “health” (and methods of attainment); its agenda, priorities, and inclusiveness right up to what might be the overarching question: “What is bioethics all about?” Unsurprisingly, these questions elicit varied responses. Scholars from various disciplines have critiqued fundamental tenets of the “ethics” business, albeit as claims of its “conservatism,” “corruption,” and its questionable “usefulness” suggest, not always with a charitable or constructive eye. But quite crucially and often overlooked, bioethics itself has not shied away from the question as to what bioethics is and what it should become; increasingly apparent is that this kind of self-conscious and reflexive theorizing is regarded as a key priority for taking contemporary ethics forward.","bibo:AuthorList":["Priaulx, Nicolette Michelle"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1017/S0963180110000824","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":105077,"sim:weight":0.311388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85729,"sim:weight":0.213126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.202803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.196528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.192454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631105,"sim:weight":0.183886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108175,"sim:weight":0.17011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.166153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.166153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.147932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The optical properties of these types of materials,\r\nin the presence of coherent acoustic pump excitation, are numerically modelled and\r\ncompared with analytical results.\r\nThe resonant acousto-optic effect in bulk ionic materials is shown to be dependent on\r\nthe coupling of a bulk acoustic wave to the TO-phonon component of a TO-phonon\r\npolariton. This requires that the material used is not only an ionic crystal but also\r\nhas a strongly anharmonic interatomic potential. It is also demonstrated that the\r\nprocess “TO phonon ± one (two) transverse acoustic phonon(s)→ TO phonon” is\r\nresponsible for the cubic (quartic) resonant acousto-optic effect. The role of acoustic\r\nintensity and frequency in the optical properties of CuCl and TlCl is considered.\r\nHigher order transitions are also investigated.\r\nIt is shown that, in the ferroelectric material LiNbO3, both cubic and quartic scattering\r\nchannels are sufficiently strong enough to consider the resonant acousto-optic\r\neffect associated with them on an equal footing. The coupling strength of both scattering\r\nchannels is estimated to the nearest order of magnitude. The cubic coupling is\r\nfound be σ3 \u003d 5 meV and the quartic coupling strength is found to be σ4 \u003d 0.3 meV\r\nboth for the acoustic intensity Iac \u003d 25 kWcm−2. The effect the phase difference\r\nbetween the two anharmonic terms has on the optical properties of LiNbO3 is then\r\ninvestigated. A tunable THz filter is proposed, based on the resonant acousto-optic\r\neffect in LiNbO3.\r\nA numerical method is developed to calculated the partial wave amplitudes and optical\r\nproperties of metal foils with acoustically excited, propagating sinusoidally corrugated\r\nsurfaces. It is then used on a system of a thin acoustically perturbed Au foil\r\non a glass substrate. The effects of varying the angle of incidence, acoustic wavevector,\r\ncorrugation amplitude and foil thickness are investigated. The numerical method\r\nis shown to remain stable even for strong coupling between the acoustic wave and\r\nsurface plasmon polariton.","bibo:AuthorList":["Poolman, Rhys"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":32603,"sim:weight":0.332934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269537,"sim:weight":0.251996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26650,"sim:weight":0.234845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222938,"sim:weight":0.232846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23197,"sim:weight":0.213565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109162,"sim:weight":0.207105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.199374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448001,"sim:weight":0.194279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.192792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268391,"sim:weight":0.177821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108107,"sim:weight":0.176147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222847,"sim:weight":0.172893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84924,"sim:weight":0.172592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.172324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268952,"sim:weight":0.16777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23394,"sim:weight":0.164691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108578,"sim:weight":0.164236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.162401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631529,"sim:weight":0.161926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76951,"sim:weight":0.157975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is the first search sensitive to neutron star f modes, usually considered the most efficient GW emitting modes. We find no evidence of GWs associated with any SGR burst in a sample consisting of the 27 Dec. 2004 giant flare from SGR 1806-20 and 190 lesser events from SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1900+14. The unprecedented sensitivity of the detectors allows us to set the most stringent limits on transient GW amplitudes published to date. We find upper limit estimates on the model-dependent isotropic GW emission energies (at a nominal distance of 10 kpc) between 3×1045 and 9×1052 erg depending on waveform type, detector antenna factors and noise characteristics at the time of the burst. These upper limits are within the theoretically predicted range of some SGR models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Ajith, P.","Allen, B.","Allen, G.","Amin, R.","Anderson, S.","Anderson, W.","Arain, M.","Araya, M.","Armandula, H.","Armor, P.","Aso, Y.","Aston, S.","Aufmuth, P.","Aulbert, C.","Babak, S.","Ballmer, S.","Bantilan, H.","Barish, B.","Barker, C.","Barker, D.","Barr, B.","Barriga, P.","Barton, M.","Bartos, I.","Bastarrika, M.","Bayer, K.","Betzwieser, J.","Beyersdorf, P.","Bilenko, I.","Billingsley, G.","Biswas, R.","Black, E.","Blackburn, K.","Blackburn, L.","Blair, D.","Bland, B.","Bodiya, T.","Bogue, L.","Bork, R.","Boschi, V.","Bose, S.","Brady, P.","Braginsky, V.","Brau, J.","Brinkmann, M.","Brooks, A.","Brown, D.","Brunet, G.","Bullington, A.","Buonanno, A.","Burmeister, O.","Byer, R.","Cadonati, L.","Cagnoli, G.","Camp, J.","Cannizzo, J.","Cannon, K.","Cao, J.","Cardenas, L.","Casebolt, T.","Castaldi, G.","Cepeda, C.","Chalkley, E.","Charlton, P.","Chatterji, S.","Chelkowski, S.","Chen, Y.","Christensen, N.","Clark, D.","Clark, J.","Cokelaer, Thomas","Conte, R.","Cook, D.","Corbitt, T.","Coyne, D.","Creighton, J.","Cumming, A.","Cunningham, L.","Cutler, R.","Dalrymple, J.","Danzmann, K.","Davies, Geraint","DeBra, D.","Degallaix, J.","Degree, M.","Dergachev, V.","Desai, S.","DeSalvo, R.","Dhurandhar, S.","Díaz, M.","Dickson, J.","Dietz, Alexander","Donovan, F.","Dooley, K.","Doomes, E.","Drever, R.","Duke, I.","Dumas, J.-C.","Dupuis, R.","Dwyer, J.","Echols, C.","Effler, A.","Ehrens, P.","Espinoza, E.","Etzel, T.","Evans, T.","Fairhurst, Stephen","Fan, Y.","Fazi, D.","Fehrmann, H.","Fejer, M.","Finn, L.","Flasch, K.","Fotopoulos, N.","Freise, A.","Frey, R.","Fricke, T.","Fritschel, P.","Frolov, V.","Fyffe, M.","Garofoli, J.","Gholami, I.","Giaime, J.","Giampanis, S.","Giardina, K.","Goda, K.","Goetz, E.","Goggin, L.","González, G.","Gossler, S.","Gouaty, R.","Grant, A.","Gras, S.","Gray, C.","Gray, M.","Greenhalgh, R.","Gretarsson, A.","Grimaldi, F.","Grosso, R.","Grote, H.","Grunewald, S.","Guenther, M.","Gustafson, E.","Gustafson, R.","Hage, B.","Hallam, J.","Hammer, D.","Hanna, C.","Hanson, J.","Harms, J.","Harry, G.","Harstad, E.","Hayama, K.","Hayler, T.","Heefner, J.","Heng, I.","Hennessy, M.","Heptonstall, A.","Hewitson, M.","Hild, S.","Hirose, E.","Hoak, D.","Hosken, D.","Hough, J.","Huttner, S.","Ingram, D.","Ito, M.","Ivanov, A.","Johnson, B.","Johnson, W.","Jones, D.","Jones, Gareth","Jones, R.","Ju, L.","Kalmus, P.","Kalogera, V.","Kamat, S.","Kanner, J.","Kasprzyk, D.","Katsavounidis, E.","Kawabe, K.","Kawamura, S.","Kawazoe, F.","Kells, W.","Keppel, D.","Khalili, F.","Khan, R.","Khazanov, E.","Kim, C.","King, P.","Kissel, J.","Klimenko, S.","Kokeyama, K.","Kondrashov, V.","Kopparapu, R.","Kozak, D.","Kozhevatov, I.","Krishnan, B.","Kwee, P.","Lam, P.","Landry, M.","Lang, M.","Lantz, B.","Lazzarini, A.","Lei, M.","Leindecker, N.","Leonhardt, V.","Leonor, I.","Libbrecht, K.","Lin, H.","Lindquist, P.","Lockerbie, N.","Lodhia, D.","Lormand, M.","Lu, P.","Lubinski, M.","Lucianetti, A.","Lück, H.","Machenschalk, B.","MacInnis, M.","Mageswaran, M.","Mailand, K.","Mandic, V.","Márka, S.","Márka, Z.","Markosyan, A.","Markowitz, J.","Maros, E.","Martin, I.","Martin, R.","Marx, J.","Mason, K.","Matichard, F.","Matone, L.","Matzner, R.","Mavalvala, N.","McCarthy, R.","McClelland, D.","McGuire, S.","McHugh, M.","McIntyre, G.","McIvor, G.","McKechan, David","McKenzie, K.","Meier, T.","Melissinos, A.","Mendell, G.","Mercer, R.","Meshkov, S.","Messenger, Christopher","Meyers, D.","Miller, J.","Minelli, J.","Mitra, S.","Mitrofanov, V.","Mitselmakher, G.","Mittleman, R.","Miyakawa, O.","Moe, B.","Mohanty, S.","Moreno, G.","Mossavi, K.","MowLowry, C.","Mueller, G.","Mukherjee, S.","Mukhopadhyay, H.","Müller-Ebhardt, H.","Munch, J.","Murray, P.","Myers, E.","Myers, J.","Nash, T.","Nelson, J.","Newton, G.","Nishizawa, A.","Numata, K.","O\u0027Dell, J.","Ogin, G.","O\u0027Reilly, B.","O\u0027Shaughnessy, R.","Ottaway, D.","Ottens, R.","Overmier, H.","Owen, B.","Pan, Y.","Pankow, C.","Papa, M.","Parameshwaraiah, V.","Patel, P.","Pedraza, M.","Penn, S.","Perreca, A.","Petrie, T.","Pinto, I.","Pitkin, M.","Pletsch, H.",",",",",",",",",","],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.211102","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.157934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85329,"sim:weight":0.12083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We search for bursts with characteristic central frequencies in the band 768–2048 Hz in the data acquired between 22 February and 23 March, 2005 (fourth LSC Science Run–S4). We discuss the inclusion of the GEO 600 data in the Waveburst–CorrPower pipeline that first searches for coincident excess power events without taking into account differences in the antenna responses or strain sensitivities of the various detectors. We compare the performance of this pipeline to that of the coherent Waveburst pipeline based on the maximum likelihood statistic. This likelihood statistic is derived from a coherent sum of the detector data streams that takes into account the antenna patterns and sensitivities of the different detectors in the network. We find that the coherent Waveburst pipeline is sensitive to signals of amplitude 30–50% smaller than the Waveburst–CorrPower pipeline. We perform a search for gravitational-wave bursts using both pipelines and find no detection candidates in the S4 data set when all four instruments were operating stably.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Ajith, P.","Allen, B.","Allen, G.","Amin, R.","Anderson, S.

Data from the fourth LIGO science run (S4) have been used in this search. Three different semicoherent methods of transforming and summing strain power from short Fourier transforms (SFTs) of the calibrated data have been used. The first, known as StackSlide, averages normalized power from each SFT. A “weighted Hough” scheme is also developed and used, which also allows for a multi-interferometer search. The third method, known as PowerFlux, is a variant of the StackSlide method in which the power is weighted before summing. In both the weighted Hough and PowerFlux methods, the weights are chosen according to the noise and detector antenna-pattern to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The respective advantages and disadvantages of these methods are discussed. Observing no evidence of periodic gravitational radiation, we report upper limits; we interpret these as limits on this radiation from isolated rotating neutron stars. The best population-based upper limit with 95% confidence on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude, found for simulated sources distributed isotropically across the sky and with isotropically distributed spin axes, is 4.28×10-24 (near 140 Hz). Strict upper limits are also obtained for small patches on the sky for best-case and worst-case inclinations of the spin axes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Agresti,

Dentine matrix proteins (DMP) may have a role in stimulating this\r\nreparative dentine formation. Multiple adult stem cells make up the DPSC population. Within this study progenitor\r\ncells were isolated from dental pulp by preferential fibronectin adherence (FNA) or using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) to isolate P75 expressing neural crest\r\ncells. Clonally expanded colonies were established. The proliferative FNA and P75-sorted populations were shown to be distinct progenitors with differing morphology\r\nand stem cell marker expression. One FNA clonal population was differentiated into mesenchymal lineages that established it as a multipotent DPSC population.\r\nClonal populations were supplemented with DMP in vitro to examine the potential role of DMP in modulating cell behaviour during dentine injury. Supplementing with\r\nDMP had a dose dependent response on DPSC viability, increased cell numbers,reduced apoptosis and promoted cell migration, suggesting that the growth factors in\r\nDMP may have a positive synergistic effect on DPSC behaviour. Fluorescently stained DPSCs were microinjected into transverse tooth slices and placed in culture to develop an ex vivo model to study DPSC behaviour in a tooth\r\nenvironment. Injected cells remained viable after 7 days of culture, providing proof of concept data that DPSCs can be localised for study in situ. This thesis was successful in the isolation of clonal populations representing\r\nprogenitor cells with different characteristics. Supplementing DPSCs with DMP promoted cell behaviour facilitating reparative dentinogenesis, indicating a potential clinical application for DMP in restorative therapy. The study of DPSCs using the ex\r\nvivo model will be important in further development of these novel therapies for dental tissue regeneration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, Chi"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222957,"sim:weight":0.464894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631685,"sim:weight":0.314283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76581,"sim:weight":0.284689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76440,"sim:weight":0.268731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.232499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222810,"sim:weight":0.212933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75685,"sim:weight":0.188011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77074,"sim:weight":0.185401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76969,"sim:weight":0.183425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77259,"sim:weight":0.179922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222942,"sim:weight":0.179611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.175334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1644031,"sim:weight":0.167125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.1566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75539,"sim:weight":0.1353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.127462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76741,"sim:weight":0.112984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The search involves calculating the crosscorrelation between two interferometer data streams surrounding the GRB trigger time. We search for associated gravitational radiation from single GRBs, and also apply statistical tests to search for a gravitational-wave signature associated with the whole sample. For the sample examined, we find no evidence for the association of gravitational radiation with GRBs, either on a single-GRB basis or on a statistical basis. Simulating gravitational-wave bursts with sine-Gaussian waveforms, we set upper limits on the root-sum-square of the gravitational-wave strain amplitude of such waveforms at the times of the GRB triggers. We also demonstrate how a sample of several GRBs can be used collectively to set constraints on population models. The small number of GRBs and the significant change in sensitivity of the detectors over the three runs, however, limits the usefulness of a population study for the S2, S3, and S4 runs. Finally, we discuss prospects for the search sensitivity for the ongoing S5 run, and beyond for the next generation of detectors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Agresti,

We present details of the techniques developed to enable this search for spin-modulated gravitational waves, highlighting the differences between this and other recent searches for binaries with nonspinning components. The template bank we employed was found to yield high matches with our spin-modulated target waveform for binaries with masses in the asymmetric range 1.0M⊙\u003cm1\u003c3.0M⊙ and 12.0M⊙\u003cm2\u003c20.0M⊙ which is where we would expect the spin of the binary’s components to have a significant effect. We find that our search of S3 LIGO data has good sensitivity to binaries in the Milky Way and to a small fraction of binaries in M31 and M33 with masses in the range 1.0M⊙\u003cm1, m2\u003c20.0M⊙. No gravitational wave signals were identified during this search. Assuming a binary population with spinning components and Gaussian distribution of masses representing a prototypical neutron star–black hole system with m1≃1.35M⊙ and m2≃5M⊙, we calculate the 90%-confidence upper limit on the rate of coalescence of these systems to be 15.9  yr-1L10-1, where L10 is 1010 times the blue light luminosity of the Sun.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott,

ALLEGRO was operated in three different orientations during the experiment to modulate the relative sign of gravitational-wave and environmental correlations. No statistically significant correlations were seen in any of the orientations, and the results were used to set a Bayesian 90% confidence level upper limit of Ωgw(f)≤1.02, which corresponds to a gravitational-wave strain at 915 Hz of 1.5×10-23  Hz-1/2. In the traditional units of h1002Ωgw(f), this is a limit of 0.53, 2 orders of magnitude better than the previous direct limit at these frequencies.

The data from both runs have been combined coherently to maximize sensitivity. For the first time, pulsars within binary (or multiple) systems have been included in the search by taking into account the signal modulation due to their orbits. Our upper limits are therefore the first measured for 56 of these pulsars. For the remaining 22, our results improve on previous upper limits by up to a factor of 10. For example, our tightest upper limit on the gravitational strain is 2.6×10-25 for PSR J1603-7202, and the equatorial ellipticity of PSR J2124–3358 is less than 10-6. Furthermore, our strain upper limit for the Crab pulsar is only 2.2 times greater than the fiducial spin-down limit.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Agresti, J.","Ajith,

The Herschel-ATLAS survey (H-ATLAS) will be the largest area survey to be undertaken by the Herschel Space Observatory. It will cover 550 sq. deg. of extragalactic sky at wavelengths of 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 μm when completed, reaching flux limits (5σ) from 32 to 145 mJy. We here present galaxy number counts obtained for SPIRE observations of the first ~14 sq. deg. observed at 250, 350 and 500 μm.\r\n\r\nMethods. Number counts are a fundamental tool in constraining models of galaxy evolution. We use source catalogs extracted from the H-ATLAS maps as the basis for such an analysis. Correction factors for completeness and flux boosting are derived by applying our extraction method to model catalogs and then applied to the raw observational counts.\r\n\r\nResults. We find a steep rise in the number counts at flux levels of 100–200 mJy in all three SPIRE bands, consistent with results from BLAST. The counts are compared to a range of galaxy evolution models. None of the current models is an ideal fit to the data but all ascribe the steep rise to a population of luminous, rapidly evolving dusty galaxies at moderate to high redshift.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clements, D.

We build detailed SKIRT radiative models based on SDSS and UKIDSS maps and use these models to predict the far-infrared emission. We find that our radiative transfer model underestimates the observed FIR emission by a factor of two to three. Similar discrepancies have been found for other edge-on spiral galaxies based on IRAS, ISO, and SCUBA data. Thanks to the good sampling of the SED at FIR wavelengths, we can rule out an underestimation of the FIR emissivity as the cause for this discrepancy. Instead we support highly obscured star formation that contributes little to the optical extinction as a more probable explanation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Baes, M.","Fritz, J.","Gadotti, D.

This event, originating from a Galactic neutron star, displayed exceptional energetics. Recent investigations of the x-ray light curve’s pulsating tail revealed the presence of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in the 30–2000 Hz frequency range, most of which coincides with the bandwidth of the LIGO detectors. These QPOs, with well-characterized frequencies, can plausibly be attributed to seismic modes of the neutron star which could emit GWs. Our search targeted potential quasimonochromatic GWs lasting for tens of seconds and emitted at the QPO frequencies. We have observed no candidate signals above a predetermined threshold, and our lowest upper limit was set by the 92.5 Hz QPO observed in the interval from 150 s to 260 s after the start of the flare. This bound corresponds to a (90% confidence) root-sum-squared amplitude hrss-det⁡90%\u003d4.5×10-22  strain  Hz-1/2 on the GW waveform strength in the detectable polarization state reaching our Hanford (WA) 4 km detector. We illustrate the astrophysical significance of the result via an estimated characteristic energy in GW emission that we would expect to be able to detect. The above result corresponds to 7.7×1046  erg (\u003d4.3×10-8  M⊙c2), which is of the same order as the total (isotropic) energy emitted in the electromagnetic spectrum. This result provides a means to probe the energy reservoir of the source with the best upper limit on the GW waveform strength published and represents the first broadband asteroseismology measurement using a GW detector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Agresti, J.","Ajith, P.","Allen, B.","Amin, R.","Anderson, S.","Anderson, W.","Arain, M.","Araya, M.","Armandula,

The first search is targeted at isolated, previously unknown neutron stars, covers the entire sky in the frequency band 160–728.8 Hz, and assumes a frequency derivative of less than 4×10-10  Hz/s. The second search targets the accreting neutron star in the low-mass x-ray binary Scorpius X-1 and covers the frequency bands 464–484 Hz and 604–624 Hz as well as the two relevant binary orbit parameters. Because of the high computational cost of these searches we limit the analyses to the most sensitive 10 hours and 6 hours of data, respectively. Given the limited sensitivity and duration of the analyzed data set, we do not attempt deep follow-up studies. Rather we concentrate on demonstrating the data analysis method on a real data set and present our results as upper limits over large volumes of the parameter space. In order to achieve this, we look for coincidences in parameter space between the Livingston and Hanford 4-km interferometers. For isolated neutron stars our 95% confidence level upper limits on the gravitational wave strain amplitude range from 6.6×10-23 to 1×10-21 across the frequency band; for Scorpius X-1 they range from 1.7×10-22 to 1.3×10-21 across the two 20-Hz frequency bands. The upper limits presented in this paper are the first broadband wide parameter space upper limits on periodic gravitational waves from coherent search techniques. The methods developed here lay the foundations for upcoming hierarchical searches of more sensitive data which may detect astrophysical signals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott,

This is appropriate if, for example, the gravitationalwave background is dominated by a small number of distinct astrophysical sources.No signal was seen. Upper limit maps were produced assuming two differentpower laws for the source strain power spectrum. For an f-3 power law and using the50 Hz to 1.8 kHz band the upper limits on the sourcestrain power spectrum vary between 1.2×10-48  Hz-1 (100  Hz/f)3 and 1.2×10-47  Hz-1 (100  Hz/f)3, depending on the position in the sky. Similarly,in the case of constant strain power spectrum, the upper limits vary between 8.5×10-49  Hz-1 and 6.1×10-48  Hz-1. As a side product a limiton an isotropic background of gravitational waves was also obtained. All limitsare at the 90% confidence level. Finally, as an application, we focused onthe direction of Sco-X1, the brightest low-mass x-ray binary. We compare theupper limit on strain amplitude obtained by this method to expectations basedon the x-ray flux from Sco-X1.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, B.","Abbott, R.","Adhikari, R.","Agresti,

It is still not understood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the ultraviolet colour-attenuation relation of starburst galaxies. Previous work and models hint that the role of the shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations play an important role. In this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasons for this deviation.\r\n\r\nMethods. We have used the CIGALE spectral energy distribution fitting code to model the far ultraviolet to the far infrared emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiral galaxies from the Herschel Reference Survey on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We explored the influence of a wide range of physical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on any accurate determination of the attenuation from the ultraviolet colour and to discover why normal galaxies do not follow the same relation as starburst galaxies.\r\n\r\nResults. We have found that the deviation from the starburst relation can be explained best by intrinsic ultraviolet colour differences between different regions in galaxies. Variations in the shape of the attenuation curve can also play a secondary role. Standard age estimators of the stellar populations, such as the D4000 index or the birthrate parameter, prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic ultraviolet colour. These results are also retrieved on a sample of 58 spiral galaxies drawn from the Herschel Reference Survey sample when considering their integrated fluxes.\r\n\r\nConclusions. When correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxies for the attenuation, it is crucial to consider possible variations in both the intrinsic ultraviolet colour of the stellar populations and the shape of the attenuation curve.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boquien, M.","Buat, V.","Boselli, A.","Baes, M.","Bendo, G.

Inclusion of subdominant signal harmonics in the inspiral signal allows for high-accuracy sky localization, dramatically improving the chances of finding the host galaxy and obtaining its redshift. A SMBBH merger can potentially have component masses from a wide range (105–108M⊙) over which parameter accuracies vary considerably. We perform an in-depth study in order to understand (i) what fraction of possible SMBBH mergers allow for sky localization, depending on the parameters of the source, and (ii) how accurately w can be measured when the host galaxy can be identified. We also investigate how accuracies on all parameters improve when a knowledge of the sky position can be folded into the estimation of errors. We find that w can be measured to within a few percent in most cases, if the only error in measuring the luminosity distance is due to LISA’s instrumental noise and the confusion background from Galactic binaries. However, weak lensing-induced errors will severely degrade the accuracy with which w can be obtained, emphasizing that methods to mitigate weak lensing effects would be required to take advantage of LISA’s full potential.","bibo:AuthorList":["Van Den Broeck, Chris","Trias, M.","Sathyaprakash, Bangalore Suryanarayana","Sintes, A.

It is a rhetorical analysis of three campaign speeches given by Senator Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential election, \"A More Perfect Union\" delivered in March 2008, \"The American Promise\" delivered at the Democratic National Convention in August 2008 and \"A World that Stands as One\" delivered in Berlin in July 2008. Reading the speech teleologically by drawing on Kenneth Burke\u0027s theory of rhetorical identification and consubstantiality, this thesis argues the Obama Model of persuasion constructs audience identity and uses specific strands of an audience\u0027s history to emphasise common ground, shared values and shared interests in provisional coalitions against common challenges. This is accomplished through the strategic use of \"we,\" through the praise of an audience\u0027s dominant symbols and values and through scapegoating, Othering and antithesis. As a multidisciplinary study, this thesis seeks to understand how these messages and strategies are received by audiences using focus groups and audience response technology. It convenes twelve focus groups of previously unaddressed audiences in the United Kingdom to understand the doxological equipment audiences bring to the rhetorical transaction of American political campaign discourse. As such, it seeks to understand moments of convergence and divergence, identification and division between demographically diverse audiences and Obama\u0027s campaign speeches. This thesis is an original contribution to rhetorical theory, identity and identification, studies on Kenneth Burke and Barack Obama, cultural studies and Joseph Nye\u0027s theory of soft power in international relations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Delp, Robert Kyle"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85230,"sim:weight":0.293952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930362,"sim:weight":0.204187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76118,"sim:weight":0.201205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.195961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.195643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77205,"sim:weight":0.187662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631515,"sim:weight":0.175565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.174661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86214,"sim:weight":0.169278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76013,"sim:weight":0.163297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.163281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.163281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86060,"sim:weight":0.150989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75773,"sim:weight":0.149958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108965,"sim:weight":0.147272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.147261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Since the time of the Enlightenment, great thinkers had been quick to predict that religion would vanish in modern rational society and throughout the twentieth century this broadly became the case. However, the events of the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries have questioned these long held expectations about the decline of religion.  One of the most noteworthy, but often overlooked, changes relates to law. Religious freedom is now recognised as a human right and discrimination on grounds of religion or belief has become explicitly prohibited. These new laws have led to a significant increase in litigation and discussion of ‘religious rights’ (a process which may be referred to as the ‘juridification of religion’). And long-standing assumptions and values have become questioned.  The relationship between law and religion has become increasingly important and increasing controversial.  This paper looks at several recent high profile effects in order to determine the effect of this ‘juridification of religion’. Cases concerning prayers said at Council meetings, refusals to give urine samples and protests outside St Pauls Cathedral will be amongst those examined to determine whether judges truly understand religion and the extent to which the new legal framework is working.

The strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species other than CO, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. Among the lensed galaxies already identified by H-ATLAS, the source J090302.9-014127B (SDP.17b) at z \u003d 2.305 is remarkable because of its excitation conditions and a tentative detection of the H2O 202-111 emission line (Lupu et al. 2010, ApJ, submitted). We report observations of this line in SDP.17b using the IRAM interferometer equipped with its new 277–371 GHz receivers. The H2O line is detected at a redshift of z \u003d 2.3049 ± 0.0006, with a flux of 7.8 ± 0.5 Jy km s-1 and a FWHM of 250 ± 60   km   s-1. The new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previous tentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within 1.6σ. The intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of H2O(202 − 111)/CO(8 − 7) are comparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-AGN Mrk 231, and the ratio I(H2O)/LFIR is even higher, suggesting that SDP.17b could also host a luminous AGN. The detection of a strong H2O 202 − 111 line in SDP.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism of the water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas probably similar to Mrk 231.","bibo:AuthorList":["Omont, A.","Neri, R.","Cox, P.","Lupu, R.","Guélin, M.","van der Werf, P.","Weiß, A.","Ivison, R.","Negrello, M.","Leeuw, L.","Lehnert, M.","Smail, I.","Verma, A.","Baker, A.

That contrast sensitivity declines from centre to the periphery is well established in humans. However, recently TMS on FEF was found to remotely affect visual cortex such that the cpd was reduced. No direct connections between FEF and occipital visual areas are known, but connections between FEF, the pulvinar and the occipital visual areas exist. I examined the cpd pattern in contrast sensitivity after real lesions in FEF and pulvinar areas by estimating visual thresholds. The results showed that real lesions of FEF do not have the same effect as TMS and are consistent with TMS causing subthreshold activation mimicking covert visuospatial attention. The cpd pattern in contrast sensitivity was different between FEF and pulvinar patients. Differences were prominent for foveal processing, while peripheral processing revealed parallel deficits, although these did not reach significance. In the second part of this work I focused on manual visuo-motor processes that have been found to differ between centrally and peripherally presented subliminal primes. For the periphery, when invisible primes are compatible with targets in their motor associations, RT‟s to targets speed up. However, for foveal primes, priming costs (negative compatibility effects (NCE)) can occur with compatible primes and targets. I examined the impact of perceptual sensitivity decline for the absence of NCE in the periphery by equating primes‟ strength via contrast threshold measurements. The results showed that perceptual equation does not equate priming effects. The critical factor, to trigger visuo-motor processes in periphery was found to be the prolonged time of the mask-target interval (SOA). This indicates that the functionally distinct retinal areas can both trigger visuo-motor processes, which are independent from visibility equation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Budnik, Ursula"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.252786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.243386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.243386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.241249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.241249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.237391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.226743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.217638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.217638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.191492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.189821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85300,"sim:weight":0.17733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76845,"sim:weight":0.170483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69994,"sim:weight":0.169689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75275,"sim:weight":0.161985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222824,"sim:weight":0.146351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.141164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.138319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77552,"sim:weight":0.138271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76111,"sim:weight":0.128473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Due to the fact that Malaysia has diverging socio-economic, cultural, ethnic groups, and ethical systems, this study seeks to find out multicultural impacts on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues and practices in the country. This study encompasses top and executive managers in financial services sector in Malaysia. A total of 1000 questionnaires were given out to the respondents in different segments of financial institutions in Malaysia namely commercial banks, investment banks, brokerage firms, fund management companies, insurance companies, unit trust companies, and large public fund organisations. The\r\nquestionnaire used in this study was modified from Aupperle, Carroll and Hatfield (1995), Maignan and Ferrell (2000), and Maignan (2001). The questionnaire was used to\r\nmeasure perceptions about CSR elements as proposed by Carroll (1991): economic, legal,ethical and philanthropic responsibilities. The results indicated that top and executive managers ranked ethical responsibilities as the most important CSR duties for corporations. The results from the factor analysis revealed four drivers that were able to motivate corporations to practice CSR namely local and global forces, corporate image,economic performance, and cultural awareness. A depth observation across ethnicity of the respondents revealed that there are no homogenous results, especially with regards to\r\nCarroll’s CSR elements.

With the underlying mechanisms strongly conserved in evolution, invertebrates have recently emerged as a powerful new model in addiction research. In crayfish natural reward has proven surprisingly sensitive to human drugs of abuse, opening an unlikely avenue of research into the basic biological mechanisms of drug addiction. In a series of studies we first examined the presence of natural reward systems in crayfish, then characterized its sensitivity to a wide range of human drugs of abuse. A conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm was used to demonstrate that crayfish seek out those environments that had previously been paired with the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine, and the opioid morphine. The administration of amphetamine exerted its effects at a number of sites, including the stimulation of circuits for active exploratory behaviors (i.e., SEEKING). A further study examined morphine-induced reward, extinction and reinstatement in crayfish. Repeated intra-circulatory infusions of morphine served as a reward when paired with distinct visual or tactile cues. Morphine-induced CPP was extinguished after repeated saline injections. Following this extinction phase, morphine-experienced crayfish were once again challenged with the drug. The priming injections of morphine reinstated CPP at all tested doses, suggesting that morphine-induced CPP is unrelenting. In an exploration of drug-associated behavioral sensitization in crayfish we concurrently mapped measures of locomotion and rewarding properties of morphine. Single and repeated intra-circulatory infusions of morphine resulted in persistent locomotory sensitization, even 5 days following the infusion. Moreover, a single dose of morphine was sufficient to induce long-term behavioral sensitization. CPP for morphine and context-dependent cues could not be disrupted over a drug free period of 5 days.\r\n\r\nThis work demonstrates that crayfish offer a comparative and complementary approach in addiction research. Serving as an invertebrate animal model for the exposure to mammalian drugs of abuse, modularly organized and experimentally accessible nervous systems render crayfish uniquely suited for studying (1) the basic biological mechanisms of drug effects, (2) to explore how the appetitive/seeking disposition is implemented in a simple neural system, and (3) how such a disposition is related to the rewarding action of drugs of abuse. This work aimed to contribute an evolutionary, comparative context to our understanding of a key component in learning, and of natural reward as an important life-sustaining process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Huber, Robert","Panksepp, Jules B.","Nathaniel, Thomas","Alcaro, Antonio","Panksepp, Jaak"],"dc:date":"2011-10","doi":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.12.008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26676,"sim:weight":0.207113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.132894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.127927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.123029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.118292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26514,"sim:weight":0.112708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.109828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929418,"sim:weight":0.108435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.0979442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76111,"sim:weight":0.0958247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.089798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.0751152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They were asked to keep a diary about their physical activities including the cycling and to take part in an interview about their cycling experiences. \r\nThe adapted cycling experience provided a new environment for participation for each young person in a unique way. Julia had limited verbal communication and was described to enjoy the experience by ‘the joy in her face’. She was able to pedal the bike independently, requiring supervision for steering and direction. Julia was also able to participate in cycling in school as was Matthew.

Trametes versicolor is a white- rot fungus of both industrial and ecological interest. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of biotic and abiotic stress factors on growth, ligninolytic enzyme (laccase) production and gene expression in white-rot fungi, using T. versicolor as a model for most of the work. Mycelial interactions are important in defining community structure in wood-rotting fungi, and during these interactions volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are produced which can affect the growth of other fungi, at a distance. The effects of different combinations of interacting fungi on T. versicolor growth and ligninolytic enzyme production showed that effects were variable. Effects of VOCs from interaction on wood blocks were more significant than those on agar. \r\n\r\nAbiotic stress factors affect fungal metabolism and thereby regulate their biological activity. This study investigated the effect of abiotic stress factors on T.  versicolor using different temperatures (low and high), osmotic pressure (KCl) and nutrients (no and low nitrogen). Growth rate, laccase production and expression of three genes (FRA19, Nox, and Lacc) were mainly reduced when the abiotic stress was imposed, although there was some variability in gene expression. Laccase is encoded by a gene family and differential expression of gene family members under stress treatments was investigated. Some evidence for an over-representation of γ group sequences following stress treatments was found. Future directions are discussed to further investigate the roles of biotic and abiotic stress in regulating the growth and underlying biological processes of white rot fungi.","bibo:AuthorList":["Muftah, Wafa"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929819,"sim:weight":0.358713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844146,"sim:weight":0.349831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81288,"sim:weight":0.288772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.21333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.208874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18950,"sim:weight":0.189789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2835561,"sim:weight":0.189789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69296,"sim:weight":0.170476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.167276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77267,"sim:weight":0.145065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71821,"sim:weight":0.144544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26919,"sim:weight":0.136928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222974,"sim:weight":0.110902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They are the primary agents of wood and leaf litter decomposition, and their hyphal networks, which grow throughout the soil-litter interface, represent highly dynamic channels through which nutrients are readily distributed. These networks also represent the primary resource for a huge diversity of mycophagous soil fauna. This study uses soil microcosms to investigate and compares the potential of soil invertebrates, representing the Isopoda, Myriapoda, Acari, Collembola, Tubificida (Enchytraeidae) and Nematoda, to influence mycelial emergence, morphology, extracellular enzyme production and wood decomposition by cord-forming basidiomycetes. While all invertebrates disrupted mycelial growth to some extent, macrofauna (woodlice and millipedes) generally exerted the strongest grazing pressures. By severing thick cords, these larger invertebrates limited mycelial growth and induced the strongest enzymatic responses. In contrast, while the smaller micro- and mesofauna reduced extension rates of some fungal species, their low-intensity grazing also induced compensatory growth responses, stimulating growth of less palatable fungal species. The varying susceptibility of different fungi to grazers also caused grazers to exert selective pressures on fungal communities. By removing entire networks of the most combative fungal species, the woodlouse Oniscus asellus prevented the competitive exclusion of three fungal opponents from soil and wood. By stimulating growth of the less competitive fungal species, the nematode Panagrellus redivivus, also reversed the outcomes of specific mycelial interactions. Via these two opposing mechanisms soil invertebrates are likely to exert top-down control, influencing the community compositions of saprotrophic fungi. Overall, the effects of grazers on mycelial distribution, decomposition and community compositions were strongly specific, suggesting that the factors which influence invertebrate diversity and community compositions will also indirectly affect mycelial growth and functioning in temperate woodland soils.","bibo:AuthorList":["Crowther, Thomas"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69296,"sim:weight":0.363901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18950,"sim:weight":0.262807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2835561,"sim:weight":0.262807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108478,"sim:weight":0.206233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.198596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76973,"sim:weight":0.17154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.164502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76877,"sim:weight":0.145103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385993,"sim:weight":0.143937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97743,"sim:weight":0.0869997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2829077,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Toward understanding the formation of multiple systems","bibo:abstract":"Context. The formation process of binary stars and multiple systems is poorly understood. The multiplicity rate of Class II pre-main-sequence stars and Class I protostars is well documented and known to be high (~ 30% to 50% between ~100 and 4000 AU). However, optical / near-infrared observations of Class I/Class II YSOs barely constrain the pristine properties of multiple systems, since dynamical evolution can quickly alter these properties during the protostellar phase.\r\n\r\nAims. Here, we seek to determine the typical outcome of protostellar collapse and to constrain models of binary formation by core fragmentation during collapse, using high-resolution millimeter continuum imaging of very young (Class 0) protostars observed at the beginning of the main accretion phase.\r\n\r\nMethods. We carried out a pilot high-resolution study of 5 Class 0 objects, including 3 Taurus sources and 2 Perseus sources, using the most extended (A) configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) at 1.3 mm. Our PdBI observations have a typical HPBW resolution ~0.3´´-0.5´´ and rms continuum sensitivity ~0.1-1 mJy/beam, which allow us to probe the multiplicity of Class 0 protostars down to separations  AU and circumstellar mass ratios .\r\n\r\nResults. We detected all 5 primary Class 0 sources in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. A single component associated with the primary Class 0 object was detected in the case of the three Taurus sources, while robust evidence of secondary components was found toward the two Perseus sources: L1448-C and NGC1333-IR2A. We show that the secondary 1.3 mm continuum component detected ~600 AU south-east of L1448-C, at a position angle close to that of the CO(2-1) jet axis traced by our data, is an outflow feature directly associated with the powerful jet driven by L1448-C. The secondary 1.3 mm continuum component detected ~1900 AU south-east of NGC1333-IR2A may either be a genuine protostellar companion or trace the edge of an outflow cavity. Therefore, our PdBI observations revealed only wide (\u003e1500 AU) protobinary systems and/or outflow-generated features.\r\n\r\nConclusions. When combined with previous millimeter interferometric observations of Class 0 protostars, our pilot PdBI study tentatively suggests that the binary fraction in the ~75-1000 AU range increases from the Class 0 to the Class I stage. It also seems to argue against purely hydrodynamic models of binary star formation. We briefly discuss possible alternative scenarios to reconcile the low multiplicity rate of Class 0 protostars on small scales with the higher binary fraction observed at later (e.g. Class I) evolutionary stages.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maury, A.

No GW signals were observed and a frequentist upper limit of 3.75 events per year on the rate of strong GW bursts was placed at the 90% confidence level.

This is an evolved planetary nebula with a central star that is currently on the cooling track, due to which the outer parts of the nebula are recombining. From the PACS and SPIRE images we conclude that there is a striking resemblance between the dust distribution and the H2 emission, which appears to be observational evidence that H2 forms on grain surfaces. We have developed a photoionization model of the nebula with the Cloudy code which we used to determine the physical conditions of the dust and investigate possible formation scenarios for the H2. We conclude that the most plausible scenario is that the H2 resides in high density knots which were formed after the recombination of the gas started when the central star entered the cooling track. Hydrodynamical instabilities due to the unusually low temperature of the recombining gas are proposed as a mechanism for forming the knots. H2 formation in the knots is expected to be substantial after the central star underwent a strong drop in luminosity about one to two thousand years ago, and may still be ongoing at this moment, depending on the density of the knots and the properties of the grains in the knots.","bibo:AuthorList":["van Hoof, P.

ISO and Spitzer studies have shown that much of the scatter in the mid-infrared colors of spiral galaxies is related to changes in the relative importance of these two components, rather than to other modifications, such as the morphological type or star formation rate, that affect the properties of the galaxy as a whole. With the Herschel imaging capability from 70 to 500 μm, we revisit this two-component approach at longer wavelengths, to see if it still provides a working description of the brightness distribution of galaxies, and to determine its implications on the interpretation of global far-infrared properties of galaxies.\u2029We quantify the luminosity of the central component by both a decomposition of the radial surface brightness profile and a direct extraction in 2D. We find the central component contribution is variable within the three galaxies in our sample, possibly connected more directly to the presence of a bar than to the morphological type. The central component\u0027s relative contribution is at its maximum in the mid-infrared range and drops around 160 μm to reach a constant value beyond 200 μm. The central component contains a greater fraction of hot dust than the disk component, and while the colors of the central components are scattered, colors of the disk components are more homogenous from one galaxy to the next.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sauvage, M.","Sacchi, N.","Bendo, G.

Because of its extreme evolutionary state, it could explode as supernova any time. Studying its circumstellar material, into which the supernova blast will run, provides interesting constraints on supernova explosions and on the rich chemistry taking place in such complex circumstellar envelopes. We have obtained spectroscopy of VY CMa over the full wavelength range offered by the PACS and SPIRE instruments of Herschel, i.e. 55–672 micron. The observations show the spectral fingerprints of more than 900 spectral lines, of which more than half belong to water. In total, we have identified 13 different molecules and some of their isotopologues. A first analysis shows that water is abundantly present, with an ortho-to-para ratio as low as ~1.3:1, and that chemical non-equilibrium processes determine the abundance fractions in the inner envelope.","bibo:AuthorList":["Royer, P.","Decin, L.","Wesson, R.","Barlow, M.

Thanks to the unique resolution and sensitivity of the Herschel-SPIRE photometer, we are for the first time able to measure the distribution and extent of cool, submillimetre (submm)-emitting dust inside and beyond the optical radius. We compare this with the radial variation in both the gas mass and the metallicity. Although we adopt a model-independent, phenomenological approach, our analysis provides important insights. We find the dust extending to at least the optical radius of the galaxy and showing breaks in its radial profiles at similar positions as the stellar distribution. The colour indices f350/f500 and f250/f350 decrease radially consistent with the temperature decreasing with radius. We also find evidence of an increasing gas to dust ratio with radius in the outer regions of both galaxies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pohlen, Michael","Cortese, Luca","Smith, M. W.

On constructing a global spectral energy distribution using the SPIRE and PACS photometry, in conjunction with archival IR measurements, we note the presence of an excess at sub-mm wavelengths. This excess suggests the presence of a signiPcant cold dust component within NGC 1705 and was modeled as an additional cold component in the SED. Although alternative explanations for the sub-mm excess beyond 350 μm, such as changes to the dust emissivity cannot be ruled out, the most likely explanation for the observed submillimetre excess is that of an additional cold dust component.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Halloran, B.","Galametz, M.","Madden, S.

This is set against the long tradition of research into chronic illness experience; however, young adults are commonly underrepresented in this area, in spite of the contention that the new-found pressures and responsibilities associated with this life-stage may be especially difficult to manage alongside a chronic condition (Arber and Ginn, 1998).\r\n\r\nSemi-structured interviews were carried out with respondents aged 18-29 (n \u003d 30). Transcribed interviews were subject to open-coding using qualitative software, which led to the systematic identification of predominant themes for analysis. Data was considered primarily as \u0027accounts\u0027 (Radley and Billig, 1996), with a focus on the moral-underpinnings of the respondents‟ talk. These accounts were examined from a rhetorical discourse analysis perspective (Arribas-Ayllon et al., 2011), which entailed micro-investigation of the discursive devices drawn upon by the respondents in representing their experiences as part of situated identity-performances (Riessman, 1990).\r\n\r\nAcross the predominant themes identified (self, other and control), some similar trends were identified, but also considerable variation, most significantly across the two conditions. In relation to self, accounts of T1DM showed respondents constructing greater levels of agency regarding the integration or distancing of illness vis-à-vis selfhood, whereas in accounts of IBD \u0027loss of self\u0027 (Charmaz, 1983) was more prominent. In accounts of other-orientation, those with IBD more commonly constructed \r\n\u0027felt stigma\u0027 and \u0027enacted stigma\u0027 (Scambler and Hopkins, 1986) than T1DM-respondents, which had implications for reported disclosure practices vis-à-vis the two conditions. Within the theme of control, T1DM-respondents generally constructed greater condition control and lifestyle control than IBD-respondents. Variation was also observed in reported management-strategies, which reflected the respondents‟ differing conceptions of their \u0027healthy bodies\u0027 (Balfe, 2009) – those with T1DM focused on future health concerns, their \u0027longer-term\u0027 healthy body, whereas IBD-respondents\u0027 concerns centred primarily on more immediate health consequences, their \u0027short-term\u0027 healthy body. These differing conceptions of the \u0027healthy body\u0027 influenced how respondents accounted for their \u0027risky\u0027 social drinking practices, with IBD-respondents producing \u0027justifications\u0027, and those with T1DM primarily constructing \u0027excuses\u0027 (Scott and Lyman, 1968).\r\n\r\nIn spite of this variation, a consistent thread running throughout the data was the constitution of the morally-driven self. A range of different moral figures were constructed by the respondents, allowing them to perform positive identities throughout. This eased the tension borne out of the conflict between the priorities, desires and demands of young adulthood and the complex considerations surrounding chronic illness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saunders, Benjamin"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":115036,"sim:weight":0.232082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.219324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.198735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.193191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.173365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.170917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.16531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.16531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.161719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.155811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.151195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.144137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.141386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632000,"sim:weight":0.124496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Na2S(aq) treatment increased the range and activity of catalytic complexes, allowing previously invisible immunohistochemical deposits of polyDAB to be clearly seen in diagnostically relevant samples.\r\nChapter 3 refined this technique by manipulating reagent concentrations whilst suppressing tissue argyrophilia, increasing immunohistochemical sensitivity by an order of magnitude. Marker deposition and thus amplification, was dependent on conjugate quality and coupling method.\r\nIn Chapter 4, scanning and transmission electron microscopy identified 8 d-block metals that increased the electron opacity of polyDAB, including W(VI), Os(VIII), Pt(II) and Au(III). The majority were detectable by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), but were present in insufficient quantities for use in analytical electron microscopical tomography (AEMT).\r\nIn Chapter 5, immunohistochemical polymerisation of halogenated aromatic diamines and bis-diamines as AEMT markers was investigated. The 16 compounds studied produced deposits of varying properties and compositions, morphological criteria identifying those of 1,2-diamino-4-bromobenzene and 1,2-diamino-4,5-diiodobenzene as suitable candidates; EDX indicated that the latter might be applicable to AEMT.\r\nChapter 6 investigated silver deposition from a physical developer by photoconversion. Photo-excitation of immunofluorescently-stained tissue sections in the presence of physical developer caused selective silver deposition at immunopositive sites, a novel method that might find application in AEMT.\r\nIn Chapter 7, characterisation of polyDAB revealed a molecular weight range of 600 to over 100,000; IR spectra were consistent with an indamine- or phenazine-like polymer. Poor solubility restricted further characterisation.\r\nIn Chapter 8, additional applications of halogenated compounds were investigated and results suggested potential applications in biological research and diagnosis.","bibo:AuthorList":["von Ruhland, Christopher John"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108317,"sim:weight":0.226682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10924,"sim:weight":0.187366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108485,"sim:weight":0.173067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.165812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108515,"sim:weight":0.164996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113592,"sim:weight":0.159291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.159076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.155475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631819,"sim:weight":0.149989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.149082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.125596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86049,"sim:weight":0.114447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108734,"sim:weight":0.111073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10937,"sim:weight":0.107056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26540,"sim:weight":0.104049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We observed the nearest carbon-rich evolved star, IRC +10216, using the PACS (55–210 μm) and SPIRE (194–672 μm) spectrometers on board Herschel. We find several tens of lines from SiS and SiO, including lines from the v \u003d 1 vibrational level. For SiS these transitions range up to J \u003d 124–123, corresponding to energies around 6700 K, while the highest detectable transition is J \u003d 90–89 for SiO, which corresponds to an energy around 8400 K. Both species trace the dust formation zone of IRC +10216, and the broad energy ranges involved in their detected transitions permit us to derive the physical properties of the gas and the particular zone in which each species has been formed.

The phylogeny is developed\r\nfrom a large body of palaeontological work that details the evolutionary relationships and\r\nstratigraphic (time) distributions of species-level taxa identified from morphology\r\n(‘morphospecies’). Morphospecies are assigned to morphogroups and ecogroups\r\ndepending on test morphology and inferred habitat, respectively. Because gradual\r\nevolution is well documented in this clade, instances of morphospecies intergrading over\r\ntime have been identified, allowing the elimination ‘pseudospeciation’ and\r\n‘pseudoextinction’ from the record and thereby permit the construction of a more natural\r\nphylogeny based on inferred biological lineages. Each cladogenetic event is determined\r\nas either budding or bifurcating depending on the pattern of morphological change at the\r\ntime of branching. This lineage phylogeny provides palaeontologically calibrated ages\r\nfor each divergence that are entirely independent of molecular data. The tree provides a\r\nmodel system for macroevolutionary studies in the fossil record addressing questions of\r\nspeciation, extinction, and rates and patterns of evolution. Specifically for this thesis the\r\nphylogenies provide a statistically robust framework for testing Cope’s rule (the\r\nevolutionary trend towards larger body size along a lineage). Eleven case studies were\r\nselected at random from all possible Neogene lineages and the mean areas of ancestor and\r\ndescendant populations were compared. Over 6000 measurements were taken from 30\r\nlineages and the resulting data show that Neogene macroperforate planktonic foraminifera\r\ndo not support Cope’s rule with only 48% of the ancestor-descendant population\r\ncomparisons demonstrating an increase in mean area. The size analysis illustrates that the\r\nmost robust method for testing Cope’s rule is to compare ancestor-descendant populations\r\nfrom the beginning and end of evolutionary lineages as these are the least affected by\r\ntemporal sampling biases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aze, Tracy"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77652,"sim:weight":0.226113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86996,"sim:weight":0.224232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15433,"sim:weight":0.222723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.193925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393539,"sim:weight":0.18551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32132,"sim:weight":0.18278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.179669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75266,"sim:weight":0.175714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393532,"sim:weight":0.172408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85001,"sim:weight":0.171159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631478,"sim:weight":0.168137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.167825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28941,"sim:weight":0.167293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108483,"sim:weight":0.16378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26936,"sim:weight":0.161509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77301,"sim:weight":0.16028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26935,"sim:weight":0.154841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108527,"sim:weight":0.144824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":267117,"sim:weight":0.132155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108098,"sim:weight":0.122719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We show that the dust-to-stellar mass ratio anti-correlates with stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and NUV − r colour across the whole range of parameters covered by our sample. Moreover, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio decreases significantly when moving from late- to early-type galaxies. These scaling relations are similar to those observed for the Hi gas-fraction, supporting the idea that the cold dust is tightly coupled to the cold atomic gas component in the interstellar medium. We also find a weak increase of the dust-to-Hi mass ratio with stellar mass and colour but no trend is seen with stellar mass surface density. By comparing galaxies in different environments we show that, although these scaling relations are followed by both cluster and field galaxies, Hi-deficient systems have, at fixed stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and morphological type systematically lower dust-to-stellar mass and higher dust-to-Hi mass ratios than Hi-normal/field galaxies. This provides clear evidence that dust is removed from the star-forming disk of cluster galaxies but the effect of the environment is less strong than what is observed in the case of the Hi disk. Such effects naturally arise if the dust disk is less extended than the Hi and follows more closely the distribution of the molecular gas phase, i.e., if the dust-to-atomic gas ratio monotonically decreases with distance from the galactic center.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cortese, L.","Ciesla, L.","Boselli, A.","Bianchi, S.","Gomez, Haley Louise","Smith, M.

We find that centralization has no independent effect on service performance, even when controlling for prior performance, service expenditure, and external constraints.

However, the manner in which the predominantly orthogonal collagen fibrils of the central cornea integrate with the circumferential limbal collagen is unknown. We used microfocus wide-angle x-ray scattering to quantify the relative proportion and orientation of collagen fibrils over the human corneolimbal interface at intervals of 50 μm. Orthogonal fibrils changed direction 1–1.5 mm before the limbus to integrate with the circumferential limbal fibrils. Outside the central 6 mm, additional preferentially aligned collagen was found to reinforce the cornea and limbus. The manner of integration and degree of reinforcement varied significantly depending on the direction along which the limbus was approached. We also employed small-angle x-ray scattering to measure the average collagen fibril diameter from central cornea to limbus at 0.5 mm intervals. Fibril diameter was constant across the central 6 mm. More peripherally, fibril diameter increased, indicative of a merging of corneal and scleral collagen. The point of increase varied with direction, consistent with a scheme in which the oblique corneal periphery is reinforced by chords of scleral collagen. The results have implications for the cornea\u0027s biomechanical response to ocular surgeries involving peripheral incision.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boote, Craig","Kamma-Lorger, Christina S.","Hayes, Sally","Harris, Jonathan","Burghammer, Manfred","Hiller, Jennifer","Terrill, Nicholas J.","Meek, Keith Michael Andrew"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1016/j.bpj.2011.05.029","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As new treatments and therapies are developed the need to better diagnose and then monitor outcomes of treatment has become more important. This thesis evaluates both structural and functional changes that occur in the early stage of AMD, known as age-related maculopathy (ARM), with the aim of determining their diagnostic potential. This thesis also explores the relationship between structural and functional parameters.\r\n\r\nTwenty four participants with ARM and 26 control participants were recruited.\r\nRetinal function was probed using four focal electroretinography (ERG) techniques: the focal cone ERG, focal flicker ERG, ERG photostress test and focal rod ERG. Long wavelength optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to assess retinal structure, specifically retinal, choroidal and four intra-retinal layer thicknesses at 21 macular locations. These techniques were initially developed and optimised for the detection of AMD related changes. The ability of each parameter to diagnose ARM was assessed. Correlation and linear regression analyses were carried out to identify any relationships between retinal structure and function in healthy controls.\r\n\r\nRetinal thickness was reduced in participants with ARM at parafoveal locations (~2° eccentricity), but choroid thickness was unaffected. Diagnostically, focal ERG parameters provided better sensitivity and specificity to ARM than OCT measures, with the ERG photostress test providing the best diagnostic potential. No strong relationships were shown between any ERG parameter and any retinal or choroidal layer volume in control participants.

Here we report a marked reduction in retinal ganglion cell synaptic connectivity in the absence of soma loss and explore the mechanism and relationship between mitochondrial integrity and synaptic connectivity. We observed decreased levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 in Opa1+/− mutant mice consistent with synaptic loss in the inner plexiform layer. Glutamatergic but not γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic synaptic sites were reduced in Opa1+/− mice. We observed increased synaptic vesicle number in bipolar cell terminal arbours assessed by immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and western blot analysis. These changes occur without significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in retina and optic nerve. Analysis of biolistically transfected retinal ganglion cells shows the retraction of mitochondria towards the soma, and mitochondrial fragmentation, preceding dendritic loss. These processes cast light on the intimate relationship between normal mitochondrial fusion and fission balances, as influenced by the OPA1 protein, in neural cell connectivity in the mammalian retina.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Peter A.","Piechota, Malgorzata","Von Ruhland, Christopher John","Taylor, Elaine","Morgan, James Edwards","Votruba, Marcela"],"dc:date":"2012","doi":"10.1093/brain","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":22696,"sim:weight":0.169324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631544,"sim:weight":0.119304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.10123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631955,"sim:weight":0.0944602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.0912207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.0896439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.0835963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

If the components of the binary possess significant angular momentum (spin), as is likely to be the case if one component is a black hole, spin-induced precession of a binary’s orbital plane causes modulation of the gravitational-wave amplitude and phase. If the templates used in a matched-filter search do not accurately model these effects then the sensitivity, and hence the detection rate, will be reduced. We investigate the ability of several search pipelines to detect gravitational waves from compact binaries with spin. We use the post-Newtonian approximation to model the inspiral phase of the signal and construct two new template banks using the phenomenological waveforms of Buonanno, Chen, and Vallisneri [ A. Buonanno, Y. Chen and M. Vallisneri Phys. Rev. D 67 104025 (2003)]. We compare the performance of these template banks to that of banks constructed using the stationary phase approximation to the nonspinning post-Newtonian inspiral waveform currently used by LIGO and Virgo in the search for compact binary coalescence. We find that, at the same false alarm rate, a search pipeline using phenomenological templates is no more effective than a pipeline which uses nonspinning templates. We recommend the continued use of the nonspinning stationary phase template bank until the false alarm rate associated with templates which include spin effects can be substantially reduced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Van Den Broeck, Chris","Brown, Duncan","Cokelaer, Thomas","Harry, Ian William","Jones, Gareth","Sathyaprakash, Bangalore Suryanarayana","Tagoshi, Hideyuki","Takahashi, Hirotaka"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.80.024009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24225,"sim:weight":0.284457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To this end, we deploy as search templates waveforms based on the effective one-body waveforms terminated at the light-ring as well as standard post-Newtonian waveforms.

R., A. K. Campbell, S. M. Smith, and A. J. Trewavas. 1991. Nature (Lond.). 352:524-526; Knight, M. R., S. M. Smith, and A. J. Trewavas. 1992. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 89:4967-4971). After treatment with the luminophore coelenterazine the calcium-activated photoprotein aequorin is formed within the cytosol of the cells of the transformed plants. Aequorin emits blue light in a dose-dependent manner upon binding free calcium (Ca2+). Thus the quantification of light emission from coelenterazine-treated transgenic plant cells provides a direct measurement of [Ca2+]i. In this paper, by using a highly sensitive photon-counting camera connected to a light microscope, we have for the first time imaged changes in [Ca2+]i in response to cold-shock, touch and wounding in different tissues of transgenic Nicotiana plants. Using this approach we have been able to observe tissue-specific [Ca2+]i responses. We also demonstrate how this method can be tailored by the use of different coelenterazine analogues which endow the resultant aequorin (termed semi-synthetic recombinant aeqorin) with different properties. By using h-coelenterazine, which renders the recombinant aequorin reporter more sensitive to Ca2+, we have been able to image relatively small changes in [Ca2+]i in response to touch and wounding: changes not detectable when standard coelenterazine is used. Reconstitution of recombinant aequorin with another coelenterazine analogue (e-coelenterazine) produces a semi-synthetic recombinant aequorin with a bimodal spectrum of luminescence emission. The ratio of luminescence at two wavelengths (421 and 477 nm) provides a simpler method for quantification of [Ca2+]i in vivo than was previously available. This approach has the benefit that no information is needed on the amount of expression, reconstitution or consumption of aequorin which is normally required for calibration with aequorin.","bibo:AuthorList":["Knight, M.

Likewise, hybridisation and introgression (interspecific gene flow) are commonly identified in natural populations, between what are described as distinct taxa. These processes have implications for how we define species and the processes necessary for the persistence and initiation of species and speciation, above and below the species level. The main focus of the present study was elucidation of the nature and extent of differentiation, and processes involved in shaping diversity within and between, species of the Aphrodes leafhopper genus, Curtis 1833, particularly from UK saltmarshes. A multidisciplinary approach was taken, combining the use of morphological, behavioural (vibrational mating signals), mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene sequencing) and multiple genome-wide nuclear marker (amplified fragment length polymorphism) analyses to test hypotheses relating to taxonomy, ecological speciation and hybridisation among Aphrodes leafhoppers. Of primary interest were: 1) identification of Aphrodes inhabiting saltmarshes, and first confirmation that two species (A. makarovi and A. aestuarina) exist there; 2) comparison of divergent ecological lineages of inland and estuarine A. makarovi, showing possible incipient speciation and evidence of convergent morphological evolution of estuarine A. makarovi and A. aestuarina; 3) exploration of the evolutionary significance of an introgressed hybrid population of A. aestuarina, found only in the Medway estuary, showing complete mitochondrial capture and some nuclear introgression.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bluemel, Joanna Katherine"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75266,"sim:weight":0.225453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844599,"sim:weight":0.222423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631478,"sim:weight":0.205893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75386,"sim:weight":0.202853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.193473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32132,"sim:weight":0.19272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77301,"sim:weight":0.179709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393532,"sim:weight":0.178141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85915,"sim:weight":0.171555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.169469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108527,"sim:weight":0.160471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643971,"sim:weight":0.156112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631527,"sim:weight":0.142612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23530,"sim:weight":0.135372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316331,"sim:weight":0.126478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75644,"sim:weight":0.11374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86227,"sim:weight":0.108838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222917,"sim:weight":0.105887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It focuses on the experiences of Filipino women married to Filipino seamen and specifically examines the spatiality and temporality of their gender identity, agency and subjectivity. Through the concept of social imaginary, it reconceptualises the role of these women in migration and considers them to play a more active role in migration processes than is suggested by the label ‗left behind‘. How the women were constrained by and creatively responded to their material and social relations not least those obtaining in the alternating absence and presence of their husbands is approached from a generative theory of subject formation. The spatiotemporality of these women‘s gender identity, subjectivity and agency is elaborated through critical analyses of aspects of their experiences and lives: on being on their own‘, routine and the temporal organization of family life, imagined communion‘ and intimacy, and autonomy. These analyses show the embeddedness of the women in material and social contexts including ties of reciprocity and indebtedness. They demonstrate the mutual implication of space and time, show their navigation of the spatial and temporal dimensions of their lives, as well as link the women‘s subjective and personal experiences to wider social and political narratives. The thesis concludes with a synthesis of and further reflection on the implications of the main arguments of the study. This includes a discussion of some specific strategies employed by the women to negotiate their spatiotemporal locations: waiting game‘, mental choreography‘ and gender negotiation‘. Finally, it reflects on the study‘s theoretical, empirical, methodological and policy contributions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Galam, Roderick"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.364895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.345796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76022,"sim:weight":0.296501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930364,"sim:weight":0.288274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.283437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.283437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77218,"sim:weight":0.277835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107050,"sim:weight":0.277449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.275507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.268818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.257197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.246991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

AMD can result in serious pollution and so is often treated by the\r\nCoal Authority in the UK the resultant solids being a costly disposal issue.\r\nCurrently the Water Framework Directive (WFD) is putting increased strain on\r\ntechnology used to remove phosphorus at WasteWater Treatment Works\r\n(WWTWs). The work presented in this thesis therefore investigates the use of a\r\nproblematic waste to provide a novel solution to the issue of phosphorus removal\r\nat WWTWs.\r\nThere has been previous work carried out on the use of both AMD solids and\r\nAMD-cement pellets to remove phosphorus from wastewaters.

Mirroring other studies, the principal\r\nmaterial studied in this thesis was then pelletised using Portland cement as a\r\nbinder. Phosphorus removal by these pellets in batch tests was determined and\r\noptimised. Phosphorus removal was found to increase with a reduction in pellet\r\nsize and an increase in test length up to the maximum length studied of three\r\nweeks.\r\nThis increase in performance was attributed to the introduction of a calcium\r\nphosphate precipitation removal mechanism as a result of the use of cement as a\r\nbinder for the pellets. This was highlighted through the correlation of phosphorus\r\nremoval with a drop in calcium concentrations and pH values. It was concluded\r\nthat the end product of this precipitation was hydroxyapatite.\r\nContinuous column tests were performed on the pellets, it was found that the\r\npellets not directly involved in phosphorus removal were still having their\r\nreactivity leached out by passing water and so when these pellets became\r\ninvolved in removal, the columns quickly failed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Littler, James"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316479,"sim:weight":0.28143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29466,"sim:weight":0.228127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76732,"sim:weight":0.226126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631076,"sim:weight":0.21273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631994,"sim:weight":0.188726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75808,"sim:weight":0.186096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10937,"sim:weight":0.170871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631785,"sim:weight":0.170044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25847,"sim:weight":0.164178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76038,"sim:weight":0.155814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26546,"sim:weight":0.155058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632032,"sim:weight":0.152014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25778,"sim:weight":0.141579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108092,"sim:weight":0.136829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631396,"sim:weight":0.133231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108734,"sim:weight":0.121468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631958,"sim:weight":0.116493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573417,"sim:weight":0.0985567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75415,"sim:weight":0.0937547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The extent of organizational publicness (ownership, funding, and control) has waxed and waned in developed countries: it rose following the postwar settlement and fell under the policies of New Right government and the popularity of the notions of New Public Management. We argue that publicness effects are likely to diminish in the face of organizational and contextual characteristics and that what matters for performance is management and organization. To this end, we examine the evidence base by undertaking a review of academic studies of publicness and organizational performance. The results suggest that publicness makes a difference to efficiency and equity, but the magnitude and direction of this effect varies with the characteristics of the empirical studies. Our findings clearly point toward the need for research that includes all dimensions of publicness, a variety of performance measures, and the moderating effects of management, organization, and external constraints.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andrews, Rhys William","Boyne, George Alexander","Walker, Richard M."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1093/jopart","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The results indicate that public-public partnership is positively associated with effectiveness, efficiency, and equity, but that public-private partnership is negatively associated with effectiveness and equity.

However, these studies investigated only a small age range of children—either young children or teenagers. The present study aims to describe refractive error development and distribution in DS throughout childhood and early teenage years.\r\n\r\nMethods: Subjects were recruited from the Cardiff University Down\u0027s Syndrome Vision Research cohort. Refractive error was measured using Mohindra retinoscopy. Subjects were grouped into 15 yearly age groups to allow a cross-sectional assessment of refractive error distribution (n\u003d182). Longitudinal refractive development was observed in 12 children with DS whose refractive error had been monitored throughout their childhood and teenage years.\r\n\r\nResults: Children were hypermetropic, on average, at all ages, albeit with a wide variation in refractive errors. Change in power vector components, M, J0 and J45, and the presence of significant astigmatism (≥1.00 D) was assessed with age. There were no statistically significant difference in M and J0 across age groups. However, there was a significant difference in J45. Prevalence of significant oblique astigmatism increased with age and was highly prevalent (45%) in teenage years. Longitudinally, no significant change in refractive error was reported with regards to the spherical component.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The results provide further evidence of the failure in the emmetropisation process in children with DS. Change in spherical refractive error is minimal throughout childhood and early adulthood. The children show a specific development of oblique astigmatism that may be suggestive of a mechanical induction through eyelids.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Bagdady, Mohammed Walid","Murphy, Paul James","Woodhouse, Joy Margaret"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1136/bjo.2010.185827","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15010,"sim:weight":0.207936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75341,"sim:weight":0.198056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75581,"sim:weight":0.19671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77281,"sim:weight":0.19123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76297,"sim:weight":0.177724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.171176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5532,"sim:weight":0.166862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733741,"sim:weight":0.163666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23821,"sim:weight":0.157515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.152381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76113,"sim:weight":0.150973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77668,"sim:weight":0.14053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26489,"sim:weight":0.136365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.133401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26759,"sim:weight":0.130669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108088,"sim:weight":0.125811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.123833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.110791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222882,"sim:weight":0.0807965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They are also well known as contaminants of disinfectants, yet their biocide susceptibility has not been studied in detail. We investigated Bcc biocide susceptibility and correlated it to their taxonomy, antibiotic susceptibility and ability to form biofilms. \r\nMethods: Genetically distinct Bcc strains belonging to 12 of the defined species were examined. Biocide susceptibility was assessed by (i) broth dilution MIC assays, (ii) agar growth-based MBC screens and (iii) suspension tests. Antibiotic MIC was determined by Etest® strips, and the ability to form biofilms was examined in a 96-well plate assay. \r\nResults: Biocide susceptibility varied across the Bcc complex with high MIC recorded for chlorhexidine (\u003e100 mg/L), cetylpyridinium chloride (\u003e200 mg/L), triclosan (\u003e500 mg/L), benzalkonium chloride (\u003e400 mg/L) and povidone (\u003e50 000 mg/L). Species-dependent differences were apparent only for cetylpyridinium chloride. There was no correlation between biocide susceptibility and (i) antibiotic susceptibility or (ii) the ability to form biofilms. Biocide MBC was considerably higher than the MIC (chlorhexidine, 6-fold greater; cetylpyridinium chloride, 20-fold greater). Cystic fibrosis outbreak strains (Burkholderia multivorans Glasgow strain and Burkholderia cenocepacia ET12) possessed elevated chlorhexidine resistance, and Bcc bacteria were also shown to remain viable in current commercial biocide formulations. \r\nConclusions: Bcc bacteria are resistant to a wide range of biocides and further representatives of this group should be included as reference strains in the development of new anti-infectives and commercial formulations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rose, Helen","Baldwin, A.","Dowson, C.","Mahenthiralingam, Eshwar"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1093/jac","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75333,"sim:weight":0.272029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24401,"sim:weight":0.117895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108388,"sim:weight":0.113635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930803,"sim:weight":0.102431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68675,"sim:weight":0.100925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643700,"sim:weight":0.0941053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222852,"sim:weight":0.0820325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75818,"sim:weight":0.0793804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76202,"sim:weight":0.078721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76816,"sim:weight":0.0782331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.0759101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222944,"sim:weight":0.0716838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222853,"sim:weight":0.0704131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316476,"sim:weight":0.07014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The empirical results show that performance has a negative effect on turnover, but that this effect is weaker for chief executives than for members of their senior management teams. In addition, top team turnover is higher in the years following a chief executive succession. The evidence suggests that chief executives can influence top team turnover by attributing responsibility for poor organizational performance to other senior managers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boyne, George Alexander","James, Oliver","John, Peter","Petrovsky, Nicolai"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1093/jopart","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66220,"sim:weight":0.356885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77949,"sim:weight":0.265394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77815,"sim:weight":0.264647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57356,"sim:weight":0.202513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74950,"sim:weight":0.178607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.174645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75350,"sim:weight":0.166738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.157355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.151689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316064,"sim:weight":0.14805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631763,"sim:weight":0.13383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85650,"sim:weight":0.129551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734394,"sim:weight":0.115821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Considerable social, economic and demographic changes have taken place in advanced societies, leading to wide-ranging changes in the family.  In Hong Kong, young people’s perception on family seems changing rapidly as well.  This study attempts to explore and examine the possible effects of global culture and values on local Chinese cultural heritage with specific regard to young adults’ perceptions on marriage, parenthood and family obligation in the global world of late modernity where conditions of risks and uncertainties require careful illumination.  The emphasis is upon the ways in which local Chinese culture responds to globalization from the perspective of family developmental theory and eco-systemic approach.\r\n\r\nThe research is a cross-sectional multi-methods exploration of attitudes held by young people about family building in Hong Kong, utilizing focus groups, survey and individual interviews as the key research techniques.  It adopts non-probability sampling in the three stages of the research that includes a mix of purposive and snowball sampling in six focus groups; quota sampling in a survey with 1132 young people being interviewed and purposive sampling in semi-structured interviews.\r\n\r\nThe findings suggest that in Hong Kong society, traditional Chinese moral values are still emphasized and endorsed, but it is observed that some western global values have begun to take root and these values might, according to the findings, be increasingly represented within the Hong Kong young people’s values systems.  Today young people experience challenges and changes in family-related roles and personal lifestyles.  Complete transition to adulthood has been delayed with increased dependence on parents.  The consequences of this for Hong Kong family life remains however an unfolding story.  In addition, this study examines various constraints to family building and implications for new policy and programme responses are discussed as well.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ng, Yin-ling"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108205,"sim:weight":0.375119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84800,"sim:weight":0.369206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.313375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.30184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76124,"sim:weight":0.267105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.262725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76022,"sim:weight":0.248948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.235713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.235713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108496,"sim:weight":0.228364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.214592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.205771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.179337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.168034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The default mode hypothesis is based on the repeated observation that certain brain areas show task-induced deactivations across a wide range of cognitive tasks. In this event-related functional resonance imaging study we tested the default mode hypothesis by comparing common and selective patterns of BOLD deactivation in response to the demands on visual attention and working memory (WM) that were independently modulated within one task. The results revealed task-induced deactivations within regions of the default mode network (DMN) with a segregation of areas that were additively deactivated by an increase in the demands on both attention and WM, and areas that were selectively deactivated by either high attentional demand or WM load. Attention-selective deactivations appeared in the left ventrolateral and medial prefrontal cortex and the left lateral temporal cortex. Conversely, WM-selective deactivations were found predominantly in the right hemisphere including the medial-parietal, the lateral temporo-parietal, and the medial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, during WM encoding deactivated regions showed task-specific functional connectivity. These findings demonstrate that task-induced deactivations within parts of the DMN depend on the specific characteristics of the attention and WM components of the task. The DMN can thus be subdivided into a set of brain regions that deactivate indiscriminately in response to cognitive demand (“the core DMN”) and a part whose deactivation depends on the specific task.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mayer, Jutta S.","Roebroeck, Alard","Maurer, Konrad","Linden, David Edmund Johannes"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1002/hbm.20850","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1645775,"sim:weight":0.31991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76668,"sim:weight":0.254613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.252265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631173,"sim:weight":0.245302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.239026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645768,"sim:weight":0.235583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631619,"sim:weight":0.234976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.231124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.231124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75275,"sim:weight":0.229819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.229333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26082,"sim:weight":0.220075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.220063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.218233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.218233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222824,"sim:weight":0.206682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69993,"sim:weight":0.205896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.20384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.20384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.199927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Research shows that object and spatial information is maintained and manipulated in WM via separate pathways in the brain (object/ventral versus spatial/dorsal). How does the human brain coordinate the activity of different specialized systems to conjoin different types of information? Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate conjunction- versus single-task manipulation of object (compute average color blend) and spatial (compute intermediate angle) information in WM. Object WM was associated with ventral (inferior frontal gyrus, occipital cortex), and spatial WM with dorsal (parietal cortex, superior frontal, and temporal sulci) regions. Conjoined object/spatial WM resulted in intermediate activity in these specialized areas, but greater activity in different prefrontal and parietal areas. Unique to our study, we found lower temporo-occipital activity and greater deactivation in temporal and medial prefrontal cortices for conjunction- versus single-tasks. Using structural equation modeling, we derived a conjunction-task connectivity model that comprises a frontoparietal network with a bidirectional DLPFC-VLPFC connection, and a direct parietal-extrastriate pathway. We suggest that these activation/deactivation patterns reflect efficient resource allocation throughout the brain and propose a new extended version of the biased competition model of WM.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jackson, Margaret C.","Morgan, Helen M.","Shapiro, Kimron L.","Mohr, Harald","Linden, David Edmund Johannes."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1002/hbm.21112","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75275,"sim:weight":0.346447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.270037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.257939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645775,"sim:weight":0.252149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76668,"sim:weight":0.245262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.226792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.211176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.211176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222824,"sim:weight":0.209809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.208999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69294,"sim:weight":0.20838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.20218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.20218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631173,"sim:weight":0.185589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76305,"sim:weight":0.18271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75956,"sim:weight":0.181478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76845,"sim:weight":0.178185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26082,"sim:weight":0.17771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.167224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65337,"sim:weight":0.146848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While the temperature-dependent excitonic dephasing is found to be similar to previous studies, the contribution from electrically injected carriers is weaker in these dot-in-a-well systems due to a reduced pure dephasing from Coulomb interaction with carriers in the barrier material. Moreover, multiexcitonic transitions contribute with a subpicosecond dephasing, corresponding to a homogeneous broadening in the meV range. In the p-doped structure, positively charged multiexcitons are formed due to the built-in hole reservoir, which show a dominating dephasing component in the subpicosecond range.

Adenosine is known to signal via four adenosine receptor subtypes, and significantly, recent findings indicate that these may play a role in MSC differentiation. We therefore investigated adenosine receptor expression and activation during the differentiation of MSCs to osteoblasts and adipocytes. The A2BR was dominant in MSCs, and its expression and activity were transiently upregulated at early stages of osteoblastic differentiation. Both activation and overexpression of A2BR induced the expression of osteoblast-related genes [Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)], as well as ALP activity, and stimulation increased osteoblast mineralization. The expression of A2AR was upregulated during later stages of osteoblastic differentiation, when its activation stimulated ALP activity. Differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes was accompanied by significant increases in A1R and A2AR expression, and their activation was associated with increased adipogenesis. Enhanced A2AR expression was sufficient to promote expression of adipocyte-related genes (PPAR and C/EBP), and its activation resulted in increased adipocytic differentiation and lipid accumulation. In contrast, the A1R was involved mainly in lipogenic activity of adipocytes rather than in their differentiation. These results show that adenosine receptors are differentially expressed and involved in lineage-specific differentiation of MSCs. We conclude, therefore, that fruitful strategies for treating diseases associated with an imbalance in the differentiation and function of these lineages should include targeting adenosine receptor signal pathways. Specifically, these research avenues will be useful in preventing or treating conditions with insufficient bone or excessive adipocyte formation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gharibi, Borzo","Abraham, Anju Ann","Ham, Jack","Evans, Bronwen Alice James"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1002/jbmr.424","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5842364,"sim:weight":0.289112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222942,"sim:weight":0.277825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1644031,"sim:weight":0.268371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.262941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631895,"sim:weight":0.211814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76066,"sim:weight":0.205704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222957,"sim:weight":0.159485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205760,"sim:weight":0.15924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222810,"sim:weight":0.155258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631685,"sim:weight":0.146336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76548,"sim:weight":0.144856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75588,"sim:weight":0.140728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76581,"sim:weight":0.137335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Bcl-2 has been reported to affect calcium release from the\r\nintracellular calcium stores through regulation of inositol trisphosphate receptors and\r\nendoplasmic reticulum calcium pumps. Physiological and pathological processes in\r\npancreatic acinar cells are controlled by calcium. Intracellular Ca2+ signals regulate\r\nnot only gene expression and trigger enzyme secretion but also might contribute to\r\npremature trypsinogen activation and development of pancreatitis, which is\r\ncharacterised by extensive necrosis of the pancreatic tissue. Detailed investigation of\r\nBcl-2 family-dependent mechanisms of intracellular Ca2+ regulation and its\r\nassociation with cell death induction is required for understanding of the basic\r\nphysiological signalling pathways as well as pathophysiological processes leading to\r\ndevelopment of severe diseases of pancreas. This study investigates the effects of\r\nBcl-2 family proteins on intracellular calcium homeostasis, with particular focus on\r\ntheir involvement in Ca2+ fluxes and CICR phenomenon. Also, the Ca2+-related\r\nactions of different doses of ethanol in pancreatic acinar cells and their contribution\r\nto pancreatitis are presented and assessed.\r\nThe results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and\r\nBcl-xL proteins with BH3 mimetics BH3I’-2\u0027 or HA14-1 sensitizes pancreatic acinar\r\ncells to CICR; and overexpression of Bcl-2 has the opposite effect significantly\r\ndecreasing rising phase of CICR-types of responses in pancreatic cell line AR42J.\r\nResponses to BH3 mimetics are at least partially dependent on both IP3Rs and RyRs,\r\n5\r\nsince inhibition of either of them results in a substantial decrease in Ca2+ release\r\nfrom the intracellular stores. However, simultaneous blockade of IP3Rs and RyRs did\r\nnot completely abolish BH3 mimetic-elicited Ca2+ release, which indicates\r\nengagement of other factors in the development of the response. Importantly, the\r\neffects of BH3 mimetics on intracellular Ca2+ were effectively inhibited by loss of\r\nBax protein, suggesting Bax involvement in the regulation of Ca2+ release from\r\nthe ER.\r\nFurther, the results presented here demonstrate that moderate concentrations of\r\nethanol (10 - 100 mM), although having only a minor effect on intact cells, induce\r\nsubstantial Ca2+ release from both the ER and the acidic store in permeabilized cells,\r\nand trigger intracellular trypsinogen activation - the hallmark of acute pancreatitis.\r\nThe data suggest that calmodulin, which is present in intact cells but is lost in\r\npermeabilized cells, constitutes a part of natural defence mechanism responsible for\r\nthe differences in the severity of the responses to ethanol. What is more, the evidence\r\nindicates that specific pre-activation of calmodulin by Ca2+-like peptides boosts this\r\ndefence and reduces the pathological calcium responses to ethanol as well as to BH3\r\nmimetics in pancreatic acinar cells decreasing necrosis. Finally, the effects of Bcl-2\r\nprotein on calcium fluxes in pancreatic acinar cells were investigated. Cells lacking\r\nfunctional Bcl-2 showed substantially more rapid clearance of thapsigargin /\r\nhigh Ca2+-induced cytosolic calcium plateau as compared to wild type cells. This\r\neffect has been explained by increased activity of the PMCA that results in a marked\r\nincrease of apoptosis / necrosis ratio in oxidative stress induced cell death.\r\nOverexpression of Bcl-2 in AR42J cells reduces ER calcium content, while silencing\r\nof Bcl-2 expression by siRNA results in substantially increased releasable calcium\r\n6\r\npool in the ER. The data indicate that at least a fraction of Bcl-2 in both AR42J cells\r\nand pancreatic acinar cells locates in the ER and is present in close proximity to the\r\nplasma membrane, making possible the direct regulation of the PMCA.\r\nIn conclusion, this study provides new insights into roles of Bcl-2 family proteins\r\nand calmodulin in intracellular calcium homeostasis. This thesis presents evidence\r\nfor involvement of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members in Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release;\r\ndemonstrates previously unknown regulation of the PMCA by Bcl-2; and suggests\r\ninvolvement of Bax protein in regulation of Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores.\r\nThe study also proposes that Ca2+-like peptides can boost natural protective\r\nmechanisms and suggests their potential applications as therapeutic agents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ferdek, Pawel"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75623,"sim:weight":0.313532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76984,"sim:weight":0.299745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222803,"sim:weight":0.297571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75622,"sim:weight":0.282833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76833,"sim:weight":0.268579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77510,"sim:weight":0.258268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631920,"sim:weight":0.242857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205864,"sim:weight":0.224315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76218,"sim:weight":0.222784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.197533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222812,"sim:weight":0.193337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631895,"sim:weight":0.175286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.166571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.159156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.154496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107063,"sim:weight":0.147879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.142691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632033,"sim:weight":0.140446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75996,"sim:weight":0.133307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76866,"sim:weight":0.13263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These instruments typically employ multiplexing ratios well below a hundred. To achieve multiplexing ratios greater than a thousand, it is imperative to investigate technologies that intrinsically incorporate strong multiplexing. One possible solution is the kinetic inductance detector (KID). To assess the potential of this nascent technology, a prototype instrument optimized for the 2 mm atmospheric window was constructed. Known as the Néel IRAM KID Array (NIKA), it has recently been tested at the Institute for Millimetric Radio Astronomy (IRAM) 30-m telescope at Pico Veleta, Spain.\r\n\r\nAims. There were four principle research objectives: to determine the practicality of developing a giant array instrument based on KIDs, to measure current in-situ pixel sensitivities, to identify limiting noise sources, and to image both calibration and scientifically-relevant astronomical sources.\r\n\r\nMethods. The detectors consisted of arrays of high-quality superconducting resonators electromagnetically coupled to a transmission line and operated at ~100 mK. The impedance of the resonators was modulated by incident radiation; two separate arrays were tested to evaluate the efficiency of two unique optical-coupling strategies. The first array consisted of lumped element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs), which have a fully planar design properly shaped to enable direct absorbtion. The second array consisted of antenna-coupled KIDs with individual sapphire microlenses aligned with planar slot antennas. Both detectors utilized a single transmission line along with suitable room-temperature digital electronics for continuous readout.\r\n\r\nResults. NIKA was successfully tested in October 2009, performing in line with expectations. The measurement resulted in the imaging of a number of sources, including planets, quasars, and galaxies. The images for Mars, radio star MWC349, quasar 3C345, and galaxy M 87 are presented. From these results, the optical NEP was calculated to be around 1 × 10-15 W/Hz1/2. A factor of 10 improvement is expected to be readily feasible by improvements in the detector materials and reduction of performance-degrading spurious radiation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Monfardini, A.","Swenson, L.

{"identifier":2829879,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria and their antimicrobial activity","bibo:abstract":"Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) are well known for their ability to produce antifungal agents. However, the majority of past studies have screened only a limited number of isolates, which were not taxonomically well characterized. In addition, while the activity of Bcc bacteria against plant pathogenic fungal species has been characterized, very few studies have examined the interaction between Bcc and saprotrophic wood decay basidiomycete species. The overall aim of this study was to begin to the characterization of the interactions of Bcc and other Burkholderia with the model ascomycete Candida albicans and woodland basidiomycete fungi.\r\n\r\nMethods. The study made use of a large collection (397 isolates) of taxonomically well identified Burkholderia species. A systematic screening of the antifungal activity of this collection was made against C. albicans and various wood decay basidiomycetes: Bjerkandera adusta, Trametes versicolor, Hypholoma fasciculare, Resinicium bicolor and Phanerochaete velutina. A wide range of media were evaluated for Burkholderia growth, antifungal metabolite production and the ability to support the mycelial growth of basidiomycetes. An agar overlay assay was used to examine the anti-candidal activity of Burkholderia isolates, while a novel overlay assay was developed using homogenised mycelial material for the basidiomycete species. Novel and existing extraction techniques were evaluated for their ability to partially purify active Burkholderia metabolites. The purification and identification of the active Burkholderia antibiotics were performed using both preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) and liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A novel TLC-bioautography assay was also developed to reveal the presence of active Burkholderia metabolites in the antimicrobial extracts. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the semi-purified Burkholderia antifungals was also determined. The natural diversity of Burkholderia and other bacteria associated with different rhizosphere environments was evaluated by cultivating isolates from local maize crops and examining a collection of Burkholderia isolates obtained from the rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia. The genetic basis for the secretion of antifungal agents by B. ambifaria was examined using transposon mutagenesis and screening for the mutants which had lost their anti-candidal activity. Additional transposon mutants that had lost their anti-bacterial activity and had been obtained in a previous screen were also examined for alterations in antifungal activity. Finally, the Burkholderia genome database and bioinformatic techniques were used to genetically characterize these mutants and other genetic loci that had been previously implicated in antibiotic production. \r\n\r\nResults. The majority of Burkholderia isolates possessed the same antagonistic activity towards C. albicans as they did towards B. adusta. Of the 397 isolates examined, antifungal activity was the greatest in the following Burkholderia species: B. ambifaria, B. cepacia, B. cenocepacia and B. contaminans. Interestingly, no antifungal activity was observed for B. multivorans (27 isolates) and B. stabilis (18 isolates) under the experimental conditions tested. The type of medium used to study the interaction between Burkholderia and the fungi considerably effected antifungal activity, with the most suitable media for studying antagonistic activity being Sabouraud agar and an acidic minimal salts medium (BSM; pH 6) supplemented with 0.4% glycerol. Of the 397 isolates screened, 47.85% were anticandidal (190 isolates; 89.47% of these were Bcc species and 10.53% were other Burkholderia species), while 48.10% were active against B. adusta (191 isolates; 93.19% of these were Bcc species and 6.81% were other Burkholderia). Extraction using Amberlite XAD16 resin binding followed by elution with methanol was an excellent means to isolate active Burkholderia antifungals. Fractionation of these extracts using silica gel TLC and ethyl-acetate:methanol:water (20:1:0.5) as the elution solvent was optimal for the separation of the majority of the active metabolites. A TLC-bioautography assay was developed in this current study as a preliminary screening technique to detect anti-microbial components of novel Burkholderia extracts. The assay was very useful for detecting anti-candidal and anti-bacterial compounds and was adapted for use for the first time with basidiomycetes. Antifungal Burkholderia isolates produced between 1 and 10 antifungal metabolites. Several antifungal agents were identified as enacyloxin, pyrrolnitrin, bactobolin and quinolines. Novel compounds and novel bactobolin derivatives were also present. For B. ambifaria strain AMMD a number of chromosomal loci were found to be involved in the production of antifungal metabolites. Quorum sensing was essential for the expression of antifungal activity as transposon mutations in the CepI synthase-encoding gene prevented the biosynthesis of all B. ambifaria anti-candidal compounds. B. ambifaria AMMD extracts containing enacyloxin IIa also produced an inhibitory effect at low concentration against E. coli, B. multivorans and A. baumannii.\r\n\r\nConclusions. Burkholderia are potentially a very large reservoir of known and novel antimicrobial agents, especially with nearly 50% of isolates screened exhibiting antifungal activity. Antimicrobial compounds such as enacyloxin IIa were discovered for the first time to be produced by Burkholderi and novel extraction and bioassay methods for anti-fungals were developed in this study. Overall, we now have the tools to considerably advance the isolation and characterization of antifungal Burkholderia metabolites.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boaisha, Othman"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18950,"sim:weight":0.170583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2835561,"sim:weight":0.170583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85118,"sim:weight":0.162402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.142271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.140393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.127543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76816,"sim:weight":0.11613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109192,"sim:weight":0.113931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75896,"sim:weight":0.113269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931330,"sim:weight":0.110183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76202,"sim:weight":0.107353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929819,"sim:weight":0.0980101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222853,"sim:weight":0.0919893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We modeled, using the direct-summation-of-scattered-fields method, the effects these ultrastructural changes would be expected to have on light transmission, accounting for the increase in corneal thickness from center to edge. Fibril positions for the modeling were obtained from electron micrographs of human cornea. Theoretically, transmission remains fairly constant across the central cornea; then, as the fibril diameter increases, the predicted scattering increases. Interfibrillar spacing changes alter the refractive index ratio between matrix and fibril; this was modeled in our theoretical deductions. Fibril number density had a minimal effect on light propagation. Our theoretical deductions were in broad agreement with our experimental data. It is concluded that the reduced transparency in the peripheral stroma is primarily caused by changes in fibril radius and an increase in refractive index ratio between the fibril and the interfibrillar substance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Doutch, James John","Quantock, Andrew James","Smith, Valerie A.","Meek, Keith Michael Andrew"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1529/biophysj.108.132316","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These variants differ at their N- and C-terminal regions, corresponding with the use of different 5′ and 3′ exons. We demonstrate that full length human ZnT5 variant B is a genuine transcript in human intestinal cells and confirm expression of both variant A and variant B in a range of untreated human tissues by splice variant-specific RT-PCR. Using N- or C-terminal GFP or FLAG fusions of both isoforms of ZnT5 we identify that the differential subcellular localization to the Golgi apparatus and ER respectively is a function of their alternative C-terminal sequences. These different C-terminal regions result from the incorporation into the mature transcript of either the whole of exon 14 (variant B) or only the 5′ region of exon 14 plus exons 15–17 (variant A).\r\n\r\nConclusions: We thus propose that exons 15 to 17 include a signal that results in trafficking of ZnT5 to the Golgi apparatus and that the 3′ end of exon 14 includes a signal that leads to retention in the ER.","bibo:AuthorList":["van Veen, Hendrik W.","Thornton, Jared K.","Taylor, Kathryn Mary","Ford, Dianne","Valentine, Ruth A."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0023878","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.194862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24400,"sim:weight":0.177409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75436,"sim:weight":0.177258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.163526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105102,"sim:weight":0.162027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.148856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76739,"sim:weight":0.14872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.145481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.142939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.136972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76066,"sim:weight":0.131724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75623,"sim:weight":0.128341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223000,"sim:weight":0.125212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76218,"sim:weight":0.122028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.117359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.10272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.10192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recent studies suggest that this gene may also play a role in pancreatic cancer.\r\n\r\nMethods/Principal Findings: Herein, we present evidence that this essential zinc transporter is expressed in hepatocellular carcinomas. Zip4 mRNA and protein were dramatically elevated in hepatocytes in the majority of human hepatocellular carcinomas relative to noncancerous surrounding tissues, as well as in hepatocytes in hepatocellular carcinomas occurring in farnesoid X receptor-knockout mice. Interestingly, meta-analysis of microarray data in the Geo and Oncomine databases suggests that Zip4 mRNA may also be elevated in many types of cancer. Potential mechanisms of action of ZIP4 were examined in cultured cell lines. RNAi knockdown of Zip4 in mouse Hepa cells significantly increased apoptosis and modestly slowed progression from G0/G1 to S phase when cells were released from hydroxyurea block into zinc-deficient medium. Cell migration assays revealed that RNAi knockdown of Zip4 in Hepa cells depressed in vitro migration whereas forced over-expression in Hepa cells and MCF-7 cells enhanced in vitro migration.\r\n\r\nConclusions: ZIP4 may play a role in the acquisition of zinc by hepatocellular carcinomas, and potentially many different cancerous cell-types, leading to repressed apoptosis, enhanced growth rate and enhanced invasive behavior.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guan, Xin-yuan","Weaver, Benjamin P.","Zhang, Yuxia","Hiscox, Stephen Edward","Guo, Grace L.","Apte, Udayan","Taylor, Kathryn Mary","Sheline, Christian T.","Wang, Li","Andrews, Glen K."],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0013158","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.24504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76984,"sim:weight":0.210425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222812,"sim:weight":0.202586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.200499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76804,"sim:weight":0.196169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.187727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631809,"sim:weight":0.187032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.184477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.17783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.176214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76866,"sim:weight":0.172127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76003,"sim:weight":0.166793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.165894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.146466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222792,"sim:weight":0.143869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75588,"sim:weight":0.143798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.139757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77174,"sim:weight":0.134803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632033,"sim:weight":0.131687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.127081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Rivers are highly structured ecosystems in which habitat complexity and heterogeneity are postulated to affect species diversity and abundance. However, the exact links between habitat structure and organisms such as macro-invertebrates remain poorly understood.\r\n\r\n2. Field surveys at the patch and reach scale were combined with a field experiment in the Rivers Wye and Usk, Wales, to: i) quantify variations in habitat complexity and heterogeneity among habitats and river sections, ii) assess their influence on macro-invertebrates, iii) separate the ecological effects of confounding physical factors and iv) determine whether habitat type and heterogeneity promote nestedness of assemblages.\r\n\r\n3. At the patch scale, surface complexity but not habitat heterogeneity increased macro-invertebrate diversity, richness and abundance independently of surface area, but only when habitat type was ignored. Surface complexity and heterogeneity were minor determinants of variations in macro-invertebrates among habitat types.\r\n\r\n4. A field experiment involving baskets containing cobbles, pebbles, gravel or 50:50 mixtures revealed that flow type explained significant variations in macro-invertebrate richness, abundance and composition, and appeared to filter organisms based on their body size. Surface complexity and interstitial volume had no ecological effect, implying that differences in assemblages among mineral habitats may result from flow-related effects.\r\n\r\n5. Macro-invertebrate assemblages occurring in some mineral habitats, typically with lower macro-invertebrate diversity, richness, abundance and trait diversity, appeared to be nested sub-sets of those occurring in some organic habitats. Nested assemblages had reduced trait diversity and altered trait representation. River sections containing fewer habitats supported assemblages of lower abundance, which appeared to be weakly nested sub-sets of those in heterogeneous sections.\r\n\r\n6. Habitat complexity and heterogeneity are concluded to have consistently weak effects on macro-invertebrates at the scales studied.

The use of the multi agent paradigm renders a system that delivers demonstrable rationality and is robust within the dynamic environment that it operates. Agent behaviour directed at working toward goals is rendered intelligent with semantic web technologies. The capture of semantics though formal expression to model the environment, adds a richness that the agents exploit to intelligently determine behaviours to satisfy goals that are flexible and adaptable. The agent goals are to generate knowledge about building space usage as well as environmental conditions by elaborating and combining near real time sensor data and information from conventional building models. Additionally further inferences are facilitated including those about wasted resources such as unnecessary lighting and heating for example.

Perspex is commonly cited as reducing bremsstrahlung compared to lead. Other reports indicate lead can be used. Newer therapies require dispensing of large activities (\u003e1GBq) and it is vital to minimize high finger doses. The shielding aspects for 90Y and 32P, two commonly used therapy radionuclides, have been investigated. Whole body doses and finger doses are examined, together with ergonomic aspects. The research highlights the difficulty in carrying out dose assessments and the disparity of the data in the literature. Three different assessment techniques were used: a) different types of TLDs; b) a variety of dose rate meters and c) spectral analysis with a germanium detector. The measurement and source geometries used were designed to replicate as far as possible those routinely encountered in the clinical environment. Investigations were carried out using three types of syringe shields for 10ml and 1ml syringes; Perspex, tungsten and a hybrid shield of plastic and lead. In all cases the hybrid shield is the optimum choice to reduce both finger dose and whole body exposure. However, ergonomically it is bulky which can result in longer handling times. This work identifies an improved shield design. The tungsten shield provides almost as much dose reduction and is preferred by operators. Tungsten shields are also normally routinely available in Nuclear Medicine departments. They are therefore considered a justifiable alternative. Although Perspex is still commonly recommended, both the tungsten and hybrid shields are superior to Perspex shields, with the exception of the 1ml shield for 90Y where Perspex was marginally better than tungsten. The other critical training issue highlighted is that finger doses can exceed statutory annual limits within seconds if staff handle unshielded syringes or vials of 90Y or 32P.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hooper, Susan Ann"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1632046,"sim:weight":0.16855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631704,"sim:weight":0.158343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.133089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1480477,"sim:weight":0.12427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.119967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632061,"sim:weight":0.116095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Ballard and Kurt Vonnegut","bibo:abstract":"This thesis demonstrates how selected texts by J.G. Ballard—Crash (1973), Concrete Island (1974) and High‐Rise 1975)—and Kurt Vonnegut—Player Piano (1952), Slaughterhouse‐Five(1969) and Galápagos (1985)—can be considered in terms of theoretical stances derived from posthumanism. By analysing representations of the ‘human’ in relation to both the ‘machine’ and the ‘evolutionary human animal’, this thesis illustrates the emergence of the posthuman subject. In addition, by recognising the intersection between posthumanism and evolutionary theory, a wider project of this thesis involves demonstrating how the use of various theoretical approaches, from the ‘humanities’ and the ‘sciences’, contributes to the formation of a ‘posthumanities’ approach to literature. J.G. Ballard and Kurt Vonnegut consistently present fictional scenarios in which the lines between ‘human’, ‘machine’ and ‘evolutionary animal’ are disrupted and blurred. Depictions assume various triangulations and configurations: from the protagonist Ballard’s auto‐eroticism, to the characters of High‐Rise conflating boundaries between the ‘human’ and the evolutionary animal that is conveyed as a constituent of human identity, as well as between the machinic environment and the human inhabitant. Further,comparable configurations characterise Vonnegut’s texts: Player Piano’s Paul Proteus’ war against the machine is superimposed by human affiliation with the machine, and the castaway characters of Galápagos are stranded by evolutionary forces that displace human authority and control to the uttermost limit. Each of these instances contributes to the effective intervention of posthumanist thinking when reading the texts. In addition, the utilisation of evolutionary concepts derived from contemporaneous publications circulating in the cultural and scientific sphere highlights the usefulness of acknowledging sources from beyond the remit of traditional literary studies’ methodologies when reading texts. The triangulation between literature, posthumanism and evolutionary theory results in a reconfigured methodological approach to fictional texts: the posthumanities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, Erica Brown"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.225434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.193968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340689,"sim:weight":0.185467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85563,"sim:weight":0.175212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77218,"sim:weight":0.169331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.163225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.163225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is argued that a Thomistic conception of justice and natural right is consistent with the notion of subjective human rights, including both fundamental human rights and certain ‘liberty’ or ‘choice’ rights. The thesis demonstrates that Aquinas’s innovative approach to justice and the political common good is useful in addressing key points in debates in political theory on human rights practice, ideal theory and forms of social criticism.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach to natural right is developed into a particular species of political liberalism, based on the genus type put forward by John Rawls and Jacques Maritain before him. The work justifies a form of political liberalism in which public reason is focused on building an overlapping consensus on the political common good between citizens through practical reasoning, but one in which there is a permissive approach to the use of metaphysical or religious arguments in the public domain.\r\nThe work concludes by offering a defence of a form of political rather than legal constitutionalism; one that takes normative orientations on the nature of political freedom and the consequent role of government from neo republican theorists, whose positions are held in some respects to be complementary with those of political liberals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walker, Gregory H."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85239,"sim:weight":0.371218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75930,"sim:weight":0.359338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85275,"sim:weight":0.354051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108330,"sim:weight":0.229551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108306,"sim:weight":0.225856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77162,"sim:weight":0.222074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In yeasts and animals, premature entry into mitosis is prevented by the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK by WEE1 kinase. WEE1 homologues have been identified in several species of higher plant, including Arabidopsis and tobacco. However, while WEE1 function has been confirmed in the DNA replication checkpoint in higher plants, a role for the protein in the G2/M transition during an unperturbed plant cell cycle is yet to be identified. To address this issue, the further characterisation of Arabidopsis WEE1 was completed, particularly focussing on the localisation and stability of the protein. A GFP-Arath;WEE1 construct under the 35S promoter was transformed into both Arabidopsis plants and the tobacco BY-2 cell line, and a nuclear localisation of the protein at interphase was confirmed. Additionally, the study of WEE1 subcellular localisation in different cell cycle phases revealed that the protein was absent during metaphase. Interestingly, levels of WEE1 degradation varied in different Arabidopsis root tissues, and the protein was absent in lateral root primordia. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 was used to demonstrate that Arath;WEE1 is degraded via the 26S proteasome pathway, as in yeasts and animals. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation confirmed an interaction between Arath;WEE1 and the F-box protein Arath;SKIP1 in vivo, which may target Arath;WEE1 for degradation. Tobacco BY-2 cells were stably co-transformed with BiFC constructs to facilitate the study of any changes in this interaction during the cell cycle. There was again no evidence of the interaction during metaphase, but a return of the signal during anaphase and telophase. The root phenotype of an Arath;SKIP1 knockdown line suggested that this F-box protein may target Arath;WEE1 for degradation early in development, but this requires confirmation. The work presented in this thesis describes, to my knowledge, the first investigation into the stability of Arath;WEE1 protein.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cook, Gemma S."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76967,"sim:weight":0.164291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76984,"sim:weight":0.152736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77156,"sim:weight":0.149214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631820,"sim:weight":0.147846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75593,"sim:weight":0.147001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76159,"sim:weight":0.146878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76007,"sim:weight":0.144544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222795,"sim:weight":0.141443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26919,"sim:weight":0.141392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780067,"sim:weight":0.138506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76739,"sim:weight":0.134766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.124905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.119032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632033,"sim:weight":0.119026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77294,"sim:weight":0.115062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223000,"sim:weight":0.111212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631881,"sim:weight":0.101319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76532,"sim:weight":0.0902891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75588,"sim:weight":0.0868907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This research aims to explore the dynamics of recent suburban growth in China and also provide an empirical case for enriching suburban theory. It is held that suburbanisation in China in its current form is by no means a spontaneous process, but results from capitalism’s creation of a new space to facilitate accumulation. Based on this view, the study examines the underlying forces of contemporary suburban growth with regard to three questions: what is the role of suburbanisation in China’s contemporary capital accumulation regime? How are the suburbs developed under coalitions of different actors? And how is suburban development shaped by demand-side actors? The study is founded on an intensive case study of Shanghai and one of its suburban districts, Songjiang. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods are used. Firsthand data from interviews and a questionnaire survey and a wide variety of secondary data were collected, providing a rich fund of knowledge for the research. \r\n\r\nWhile similar forms and functions to (post)-suburban settlements that have recently emerged in Western countries are found in Chinese suburbs, suburbanisation through new town development in China is a strategy of capital accumulation in response to a range of new conditions specific to China’s local context. New towns deal with the recentralisation of both fiscal and land development powers on the one hand, and accommodate the increasing housing demands of a diverse labour force on the other. Moreover, a peculiar land-centred accumulation regime is established in which real estate development and industrial development mutually reinforce each other. The development of these suburban nodes is organised under state-led entrepreneurial governance in which coalitions are led by the suburban district government and followed by various public and private sectors; however, this is manipulated by the municipal government. Demand-based driving forces are manifold, including four interwoven processes: industrial restructuring and economic growth, outwards-migration, urbanisation, and capitalisation. Three types of people, namely migrants, local natives and residents from central Shanghai, constitute the main groups of suburban residents. Their spatial sorting creates a heterogeneous suburban space.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shen, Jie"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222951,"sim:weight":0.237364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76124,"sim:weight":0.224861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.221729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.21978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108670,"sim:weight":0.206347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76162,"sim:weight":0.204014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631487,"sim:weight":0.201671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.199969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.196148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.196148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.19267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108854,"sim:weight":0.187173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.186389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85288,"sim:weight":0.181983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930473,"sim:weight":0.174594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.173829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.169971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222808,"sim:weight":0.150741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":2830530,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Investments and innovation: regional venture capital activity, business innovation and an ecology of interactions","bibo:abstract":"This research adds to the growing literature from recent years on innovation finance, innovation systems, and regional economic and innovation policy. Although the role of business has been seen as critical within the regional innovation system, the role of business financing intermediaries has received considerably less attention despite its recognised role as a central actor of the system. This research focuses on an innovation player that seems to have been neglected by scholars to date, namely the venture capital industry. The research examines the role of different types of venture capital, public and private, in fostering innovation at the regional level.  In examining this relationship, this thesis empirically analyses the characteristics of 4117 investments deals made to 2359 companies, the innovation outputs of these businesses and the responses to a survey of 50 venture capital professionals. The contribution of this thesis is threefold:\r\n\r\nFirst, this thesis investigates whether and how the supply of private sector venture capital and supportive public interventions has changed the availability of venture capital at the regional level. It examines the combination of venture capital in the UK regions by providing a detailed analysis of the extent of venture capital public dependency in each UK region. It also elaborates on the potential implications of the public sectors’s domination in venture capital provision in several UK regions. The regional dimension of the analysis is of special interest as it is the first comprehensive analysis of the source of VC investments (public or private) for each UK region.  From a regional perspective, the UK now appears to have two venture capital markets. In London, the South East and, to a lesser extent, the East of England, private sector investors dominate investment activity. This contrasts with the remainder of the UK where the venture capital market is underpinned by extensive public sector involvement. \r\n\r\nSecond, this thesis also investigates the role of venture capital in innovation using patents as a proxy variable for business innovation. In this way, it contributes to  the literature by analysing the relation between patenting practices of venture capital backed firms, paying particular attention to  two aspects: first, the company’s  acquisition of venture finance and progress through the venture capital journey and second, the relationship between patent practices and source of venture capital finance (public or private) in  UK regions.  The analysis shows a clear relationship between venture capital and patents. Companies with patents are more likely to secure follow up venture capital finance compared with companies without patents. The econometric analysis results also suggest that UK companies with moderate public venture capital support are positively associated with patents while  companies  with extensive public venture capital support are negatively associated with  patents, compared to companies with solely private venture capital support.\r\n\r\nThe final part of the thesis investigates whether the environment in which funds operate may explain observed differences in the ability of these funds to invest in companies with the potential to innovate. It does this by examining the ecology of interaction between venture capital and regional innovation systems. This is the first detailed empirical investigation of the relationship between different types of venture capital (private or public) and other players of the innovation system such as universities incubators, research institutes, and regional authorities.  Three important findings emerge from this analysis.  First, venture capital public dependence is strongly and significantly associated with higher volumes of interactions with the outside world. The more publicly dependent a fund is, the more it interacts with other players of the innovation system. Second, the role of proximity is still important within the VC industry. Venture capitalists from both the private and the public sector, are more likely to interact with their counterparts from the same region. Third, there is evidence to suggest that operators of publicly backed funds are lacking close connections with their counterparts from the private sectors. This may have implications for their ability to approach and attract private heavy weighted venture capital funds and limited partners that can provide follow on investments or raise further funding for the fund.  \r\n\r\nAlthough publicly backed venture capitalists interact to a greater extent than the private counterparts, they experience less success (measured as financial performance of the fund or performance of their portfolio companies). It is widely acknowledged that interactions between venture capitalists and other players promotes tacit knowledge, but the results of this thesis suggests that interaction on its own is not enough to provoke success.\r\n\r\nOverall, the findings of this research suggests that the distinction between the two venture capital markets in the UK, publicly or privately driven,  is not limited to the volume or type of venture capital activity but also relates to   the ecology of interactions between venture capitalists and other players of the regional innovation system.  Since publicly backed funds do not promote innovation to the same extent that private funds do when they invest alone, UK regions that are heavily dependent on public investments may not be able to receive the benefits of a functional venture capital industry. However, regions in which public venture capital funds work closely with private funds, demonstrate a relatively higher volume of venture capital backed companies with the potential to innovate. From a policy perspective, this finding suggests that from an innovation point of view, free public standing investments should be minimised while co-investments between publicly backed and private venture capital funds should be further encouraged.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pierrakis, Ioannis"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1632272,"sim:weight":0.338751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.308803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929871,"sim:weight":0.282721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77250,"sim:weight":0.265362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85341,"sim:weight":0.254759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.199133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.19643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Chapter I and II use the unpublished retailer-level and producer-level microdata underlying CPI and PPI in the UK statisti-cal authority to study empirical price rigidity and price setting mechanisms. Based on the conventional frequency-based method, little rigidity is found since the implied price duration is less than half a year. However, this method is shown to significantly underestimate the true duration due to oversampling of short price spells. Alternative-ly, a trajectory-based cross-sectional approach is adopted, giving an unbiased and ro-bust estimate for average duration over 9 months (retailer price) and 15 months (pro-ducer price). That is to say, producer price has higher degree of rigidity than retailer price if cross-sectional approach is used. Both time-dependent and state-dependent features exist in price setting. In particular for retailer price, results also suggest con-spicuous heterogeneities in price rigidity across sectors and shop types, but weak dif-ference across regions and time. The overall hazard function of price change can be decomposed into a decreasing component from goods sectors and a 4-month cyclical component from services sectors.\r\nThe empirical findings in the microdata not only contribute to the microdata literature on price setting behaviour, but also make possible the calibrations of macroeconomic DSGE model with heterogeneous price setting. Hence, based on the microdata find-ings in Chapter I and II, Chapter III uses Classical maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference to evaluate and estimate DSGE models with various price setting mecha-nisms. A vital problem with homogeneous price setting models is that they cannot generate enough persistence while keeping calibration of average price rigidity con-sistent with microdata evidence. In contrast, this ―persistence puzzle‖ is successfully resolved by heterogeneous price setting models, which greatly improve the dynamic performance of macroeconomic models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhou, Peng"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5223001,"sim:weight":0.147582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631847,"sim:weight":0.086279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first and introductory part explores the way modern sculpture has developed and redefined its status and meaning in the history of art from Rodin until Duchamp and the movements of found art and conceptual art. The aim of the first part is to specify the issue of perception and the function of phenomenology in the understanding of modern sculpture. The second and third parts aim to specify the validity of modern sculpture as art, considering particularly Heidegger’s thinking on the nature of art and the truth of art in the postreligious age of modernity.

The third part examines more closely the way abstract art and\r\nspecifically the work of Barnett Newman could be seen as a truth revealing, following Heidegger’s criticism of the metaphysics of symbolic and representational art.\r\n\r\nThe thesis argues that the validity of modern sculpture and generally modern art lies in its acknowledgement or, in Heidegger terms, thinking of the homelessness of the\r\nhuman being in modernity and the destitution of modernity, and hence in its revealing of the aspect of the truth and being that has been forgotten.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sofiali, Eftychia"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.229172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223937,"sim:weight":0.206288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.203148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555269,"sim:weight":0.193141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108318,"sim:weight":0.190368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108175,"sim:weight":0.15812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Despite the well-established role of aberrant Wnt signalling in initiation and progression of colorectal cancer, therapies that speciﬁcally target the Wnt pathway are exceptionally limited. The development of such therapies is, in part, restricted by the toxicity of Wnt signalling inhibition for adult tissue homeostasis. Given this limitation, therapies that target downstream components and target genes of the Wnt pathway are required to minimise potential toxicity.\r\n\r\nThe chromatin remodelling ATPase subunit Brg1 has been found to interact with β-catenin and facilitate transcriptional program driven by the Wnt pathway. In this thesis I aimed to explore Brg1’s potential as a therapeutic target in Wnt driven intestinal tumourigenesis. To achieve this, I conditionally deleted Brg1 in the murine small intestinal epithelium under normal physiological conditions and in the context of aberrant Wnt signalling using a range of transgenic mouse models. Additionally, I investigated the potential toxicity of Brg1 inhibition by analysing the effects of Brg1 loss in a range of epithelial tissues from the gastrointestinal tract and bladder.\r\n\r\nThe results presented in this thesis demonstrate that Brg1 deﬁciency impedes Wnt-driven tumourigenesis in the murine small intestinal epithelium via attenuation of Wnt signalling and the elimination of stem cell derived tumours, which have a higher tumourigenic potential. Additionally, Brg1 was found to play a major role in the maintenance of normal small intestinal stem cell homeostasis, as loss of Brg1 in the small intestinal epithelium resulted in ablation of the stem cell population. The impact of Brg1 deﬁciency on homeostasis of other tissues of the gastrointestinal tract and bladder exhibited a remarkable diversity, from induction of epithelial hyperplasia to very subtle alterations in cell differentiation.\r\n\r\nOverall, the results presented in this thesis portray Brg1 as a promising potential therapeutic target in Wnt-driven neoplasia and suggest that speciﬁc targeting of the Brg1/β-catenin interaction rather than the catalytic activity of Brg1 may help to avoid any Wnt-independent toxicity of Brg1 inhibition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holik, Aliaksei"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77468,"sim:weight":0.271103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734379,"sim:weight":0.164509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780069,"sim:weight":0.148205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76062,"sim:weight":0.145294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.107066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.104633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631809,"sim:weight":0.103857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222812,"sim:weight":0.0995441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.0939083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631715,"sim:weight":0.0934433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.0925144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76866,"sim:weight":0.0895458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.0889289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222792,"sim:weight":0.0835322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105102,"sim:weight":0.0827839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76122,"sim:weight":0.0827515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.0793023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.07107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75579,"sim:weight":0.0697362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.067676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This research is guided by an argument considering that the problem is in the founding process of the current IZs and, hence, future industrial development in Egypt is prone to the same destiny, if it is going to follow the current process, that lacks theorisation. This research, therefore, stemmed out of a concern to understand the process which gives shape to these IZs, and the factors which govern this process. This is the first crucial step, this research has contributed to, towards sustainability of the future industrial development. The importance of taking this step increased after the 25th of January Revolution that has put Egypt on the way towards democracy and progress after an authoritarian era of governing under which the country had been deteriorating.  \r\nOut of this concern, the research theoretically investigated the current position of the Egyptian industry from industrial ecology (IE) and governance for sustainable development (SD) perspective. Further, a pilot study was conducted, making use of a preliminary conceptual framework for sustainable IZs which the research developed from literature on IE and governance for SD. While the investigation fell short of providing a full understanding of the process, it was found that Egypt has recently made some legal and institutional arrangements to incorporate sustainability. However, the debate on the seriousness and effectiveness of these arrangements had been quite contradictory. It was also found that the whole founding process of IZs is complex and controlled by the government, where the planning phase is the best to allow for participation of partners, as highly called for by the international debate on IE. The importance of the role of planning in guiding the implementation of IE in communities is also internationally highlighted. Therefore, the research set out to, through empirical investigation, understand realities of only the current planning process and its governing factors. \r\nTo help do that, this research constructed an in-depth conceptual framework of the planning process through which IE could be normatively implemented. The framework guided the empirical qualitative study which depended on a multi-stage, multi-method approach with a case study design in its core. Three case studies, representing the Industrial Developer Program, the most recent program expected to influence the future industrial development and the most advanced case to adopt sympathetic approaches to IE and SD concepts, were chosen. Semi-structured interviews with involved key partners and experts, primary and secondary documentary data sources, and observations were utilised. \r\nThe official and actual planning processes, synthesized in this research, are found to be unsustainable. Despite the partial involvement, doubted in its purposes, of industrial developers in the process, the IZs planning is conducted through a top down process that suffers from centrality and government monopoly of  decision-making in most of the steps. This top down process has been strengthened by diminishing the role of regional level, that is supposed to connect the national level to the local one back and forth to empower the participatory planning approach. Regarding the factors influencing the current process, it is found that the authoritarian nature of the previous regime has deeply/negatively influenced the context, shaping the planning process. Authoritarianism has created a set of other factors that has flawed the context making it chaotic and disabling for the implementation of SD/IE. The research concludes by reflecting on the international debate on IE, presenting, thereafter, a new list of barriers to IE implementation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shalaby, Mohie"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1643996,"sim:weight":0.306159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222885,"sim:weight":0.304551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.289849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.289849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.286085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631884,"sim:weight":0.281531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.278539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77201,"sim:weight":0.26368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.260631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86062,"sim:weight":0.236612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108959,"sim:weight":0.235334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222808,"sim:weight":0.225771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75350,"sim:weight":0.219348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first interval covers the period which is known in the Albanian history as the \u0027National Rebirth‘. The second deals with the recent history of political resistance of Kosovo Albanians and their \u0027sudden‘ discursive shift, from the narrative of \u0027unification with the Motherland Albania‘ (the unification\u0027st/irredentist discourse) to the narrative of \u0027the independent Kosovo‘ (the independentist discourse)\r\nThe main theoretical pillars of the study focus on the theories about the nation (specifically, its ethnic variation) and its narrative, the nationalism—as well as the representational systems of orientalism and balkanism (Said, 1978; Todorova, 1997). The study demonstrates that the discourse about the nation and national identity among Albanians is produced primarily through the internalisation of the external, orientalist approach in defining and understanding the social reality of the Balkan societies. Such internalisation is analysed through the prism of local adoption of the sociocultural and sociopolitical hegemonizing discourse that constituted the Western orientalist \u0027knowledge‘ about the Balkans—and, specifically, Albanians. (The study notes that such discursive strategy of internalisation of orientalist traits within the ethnonationalist narrative is not limited to the Albanian societies (in both Albania and Kosovo) but appears as common feature in most of the societies/nations of the former Yugoslavia. In time, the study highlights, such process of \u0027nesting orientalisms‘ (Bakic-Hayden, 1996) was coupled with the phenomenon of the regional, exclusionist and competing ethnonationalist narratives which was aimed at constituing a nation‘s \u0027westernness‘ and \u0027Europeanness‘ through denying it to the other.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorani, Dukagjin"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6615,"sim:weight":0.416713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108545,"sim:weight":0.411122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85255,"sim:weight":0.341333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.272439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85055,"sim:weight":0.267388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75990,"sim:weight":0.256195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930823,"sim:weight":0.251003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.225614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108122,"sim:weight":0.221864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.215847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.215847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85220,"sim:weight":0.212189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.203566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.188917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227169,"sim:weight":0.177999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although treatment with titanium implants is highly successful and predictable, it has been identified that chronic inflammatory diseases associated with bacterial colonisation, occur around the implant fixtures and may affect the supporting tissues of dental implants and their long-term success. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a Gram-negative anaerobe, is one of the prime pathogens identified as implicated in the development of both these diseases.\r\nAn ex vivo culture model of 28-days old wistar rats mandible slices has been utilised to investigate the local response of the tissues to the supernatant produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis. To study the effect of titanium on virulence, three strains of P. gingivalis were cultured for 48 hours in the presence of smoothened and moderately roughened titanium specimens prior to supernatant collection. The ex vivo culture model was then exposed for a total of either 3 or 7 days to concentrations of 50μg/ml and 100μg/ml of supernatants from the three strains of P. gingivalis grown in the different conditions. The supernatants, which contain the extracellular produce of P. gingivalis, had an adverse effect in the periodontal connective tissues (ligament) of the mandible slices of this model, in that it caused extensive cell death and disorganisation of the matrix of these tissues and specific cellular responses. However, the presence of titanium (either smoothened or moderately roughened),whilst producing the supernatant did not appear to have an important additional effect on virulence in this model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sakellariou, Nikolaos"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5839654,"sim:weight":0.195123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75818,"sim:weight":0.158038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631793,"sim:weight":0.136403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76576,"sim:weight":0.135884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24401,"sim:weight":0.1314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222957,"sim:weight":0.122774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76581,"sim:weight":0.121461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76322,"sim:weight":0.120833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631685,"sim:weight":0.120041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930803,"sim:weight":0.114002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76743,"sim:weight":0.108557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75539,"sim:weight":0.104487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.09668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.0822714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222810,"sim:weight":0.0790109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Magnetic properties of convention grain oriented (CGO) and high\r\npermeability grain oriented (HGO) electrical steels were measured and compared at\r\nhigh and low flux densities at power magnetising frequency. HGO was found to have\r\nbetter magnetic properties at both high and low magnetisation regimes. This is\r\nbecause of the higher grain size of HGO and higher grain-grain misorientation of\r\nCGO.\r\nAs well as its traditional use in non-destructive evaluation, Barkhausen Noise (BN)\r\nstudy is a useful tool for analysing physical and microstructural properties of\r\nelectrical steel which control their bulk magnetic properties. Previous works deal with\r\nmeasurements carried out at high flux densities (0.2 T and above) but this work\r\ndemonstrates that BN has different characteristics at low flux densities. The results\r\nshow that the amplitude sum and the rms BN signals are higher for HGO than CGO\r\nsteels at high flux densities. Below 0.2 T, the BN signal becomes higher for CGO\r\nsteel. This is because of grain size/misorientation effects. Mechanically scribing of\r\nHGO samples on one surface transverse to the rolling direction was found to reduce\r\nthe BN amplitude at high flux densities due to the decrease of domain width by\r\nscribing. The trend reverses again at low flux density.\r\nRemoval of the coating from the surface of CGO and HGO electrical steels was found\r\nto increase the BN due to the widening of the 180° domains as a result of the release\r\nof the tensile stress imparted to the materials during coating.\r\nThe BN characteristics of decoated samples with a 3 MPa tension applied were found\r\nto be similar to those observed before decoating demonstrating the close similarity\r\nbetween the effects of coating stress and externally applied stress on BN due to their\r\nsimilar roles in domain refinement. A strong correlation between average velocity of\r\ndomain wall movement and changes in BN in conventional and high permeability\r\nsteels was found which demonstrates that the dominant factor responsible for BN\r\nv\r\nemission is the mean free path of domain wall movement and hence the width of the\r\npredominant 180° domains in these materials.\r\nBN of commercially produced non-oriented electrical steel was found to be\r\ninfluenced by silicon contents and sample thickness. BN was found to increase with\r\ndecreasing strip thickness and increase with increasing silicon contents owing to eddy\r\ncurrent shielding effects. The rms values of the BN and the total sum of amplitudes\r\nwere found to increase with the rate of change of flux density at all the peak flux\r\ndensities measured. The findings show that the influence of sample thickness and\r\nsilicon content is significant and must be taken into consideration when measuring\r\nand interpreting BN in non-oriented electrical steel.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chukwuchekwa, Nkwachukwu"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86116,"sim:weight":0.227584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734349,"sim:weight":0.225532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.219798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77146,"sim:weight":0.218134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77335,"sim:weight":0.19678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56626,"sim:weight":0.195543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.188737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60984,"sim:weight":0.187881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.179197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631529,"sim:weight":0.173023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75460,"sim:weight":0.170528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.161706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631735,"sim:weight":0.158266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76426,"sim:weight":0.157385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.155011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27098,"sim:weight":0.146467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27120,"sim:weight":0.143823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77263,"sim:weight":0.141717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222904,"sim:weight":0.138321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222938,"sim:weight":0.131139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Qualitative datasets from six separate projects are analysed to trace commonalities and variation over time in the conceptualisation of climate change as a physical, social and personal phenomenon. Ways of understanding are presented as a series of discourses. These relate to people’s appraisal of climate science, the apprehension of climate change through informal evidence, and how climate is seen in relation to natural systems; as well as the means by which climate change is contextualised to social systems, to cultural and historical conditions, and with respect to daily life. Climate discourses across all domains are found to be relatively stable over time, though with subtle shifts in meaning and emphasis. Emergent trends include recent evidence of climate ‘fatigue’ and an increased tendency to question the anthropogenic component to climate change, but also the view that action on climate change has become normalised in recent years. Survey data are also used to explore the prevalence of identified ways of understanding, and to examine longitudinal changes in these. There is some evidence of decline in climate change concern and increase in scepticism over the past decade, though these trends are not pronounced. Cold weather events from 2009/2010 are interpreted by people as evidence of the veracity of climate change (more so than as disconfirming it). Cultural worldviews are found to underlie perceptions.\r\nFindings are interpreted in the context of cultural theoretical and discursive frameworks. These present the opportunity to explain the recurrent, patterned and socially-shared nature of public perspectives, and the ways in which these are used both to understand climate change and to account for the actions of oneself and others.\r\nThe development of combined secondary and longitudinal qualitative analytic techniques is a central methodological concern of the thesis.

Rather than developing a grand theory, I focus on\r\nadapting current perspectives in the social psychology of emotion, automaticity, goals and\r\nmental simulation to the study of political action and social change. The approach taken is\r\neclectic both theoretically and methodologically.\r\nIn Chapter 1, I review the social psychology of political action and social change. In\r\ndoing so, I conceptualise political action and social change and explore current explanations of\r\nthese phenomena. I also introduce moral emotions, automaticity and imagination in order to\r\nmark the way for the subsequent chapters.\r\nIn Chapter 2, I examine the role of the moral emotions in political action and social\r\nchange. Specifically, I explore the antecedents and consequences of anger, sympathy, and\r\nadmiration. Drawing on theories of intergroup relations and emotion, I show that legitimate\r\nstatus, competence, and warmth all elicit admiration. Notably, admiration towards the\r\nauthorities and centres of group power inhibits political action aimed at challenging the social\r\norder. However, when the target of admiration is a subversive hero or “martyr”, admiration\r\nuniquely predict willingness to challenge the status quo.\r\nIn Chapter 3 I investigate the role of automaticity in political action. More specifically,\r\nI develop a dual process account of political action. I demonstrate that controlled (vs.\r\nautomatic) processes lead to an increase in political action tendencies in members of a\r\ndisadvantaged group. Notably, automatic protest attitudes influence political action through\r\nanger. That is, the more positive one’s automatic protest attitudes are the more anger they feel\r\nin relation to group grievances. Notably, automatic attitudes are more likely to predict political\r\naction when one is low in the motivation and ability to deliberate on political issues.\r\nIn Chapter 4 I examine the role of imagination in political action and social change. I\r\ndemonstrate that being able to imagine a particular social change goal (e.g., revolution or\r\nreform) uniquely predict political action tendencies aimed at that goal. Notably, imagination\r\nalso qualifies the influence of efficacy and anger on politic action tendencies. Put simply, anger\r\nonly predicts political action for collective mobility when group members can imagine this\r\nsocial change goal. In addition, efficacy only predicts action aimed at revolution when one can\r\nimagine an alternative social system (e.g., economy).\r\nIn Chapter 5 I draw some conclusions, and discuss the limitations and issues that arise\r\nfrom the work presented here. Finally, I propose some avenues for future research. In\r\niii\r\naddition, I put forward a typology of social change in the hope that it will engender future\r\nwork on the social psychology of political action and social change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sweetman, Joseph"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These form about 20%\r\nof global power generating capacity, normally being fired on natural gas, but this is\r\nexpected in the future to move towards hydrogen enriched gaseous fuels to reduce CO2\r\nemissions. Gas turbine combined cycles can give electrical power generation efficiencies of\r\nup to 60%, with the aim of increasing this to 70% in the next 10 to 15 years, whilst at the\r\nsame time substantially reducing emissions of contaminants such as NOx.\r\nThe gas turbine combustor is an essential and critical component here. These are\r\nuniversally stabilized with swirl flows, which give very wide blowoff limits, and with\r\nappropriate modification can be adjusted to give very low NOx and other emission. Lean\r\npremixed combustion is commonly used at pressures between 15 to 30 bar, these even out\r\nhot spots and minimise formation of thermal NOx. Problems arise because improving\r\nmaterials technology/improved cooling techniques allow higher turbine inlet temperatures,\r\nhence higher efficiencies, but with the drawback of potentially higher emissions and\r\nstability problems.\r\nThis PhD study has widely investigated and analysed two different kinds of gas turbine\r\nswirl burners. The research has included experimental investigation and computational\r\nsimulation. Mainly, the flashback and blowoff limits have been comprehensively analysed\r\nto investigate their effect upon swirl burner operation. The study was extended by using\r\ndifferent gas mixtures, including either pure gas or a combination of more than one gas like\r\nnatural gas, methane, hydrogen and carbon dioxide.\r\nThe first combustor is a 100 kW tangential swirl combustor made of stainless steel that has\r\nbeen experimentally and theoretically analysed to study and mitigate the effect of flashback\r\nphenomena. The use of a central fuel injector, cylindrical confinement and exhaust sleeve\r\nare shown to give large benefits in terms of flashback resistance and acts to reduce and\r\nsometimes eliminate any coherent structures which may be located along the axis of\r\nsymmetry. The Critical Boundary Velocity Gradient is used for characterisation of\r\nflashback, both via the original Lewis and von Elbe formula and via new analysis using\r\nCFD and investigation of boundary layer conditions just in front of the flame front.\r\nConclusions are drawn as to mitigation technologies. It is recognized how isothermal\r\nconditions produce strong Precessing Vortex Cores that are fundamental in producing the\r\nii\r\nfinal flow field, whilst the Central Recirculation Zones are dependent on pressure decay\r\nratio inside the combustion chamber. Combustion conditions showed the high similarity\r\nbetween experiments and simulation. Flashback was demonstrated to be a factor highly\r\nrelated to the strength of the Central Recirculation Zone for those cases where a\r\nCombustion Induced Vortex Breakdown was allowed to enter the swirl chamber, whilst\r\ncases where a bluff body impeded its passage showed a considerable improvement to the\r\nresistance of the phenomenon. The use of nozzle constrictions also reduced flashback at\r\nhigh Reynolds number (Re). All these results were intended to contribute to better designs\r\nof future combustors.\r\nThe second piece of work of this PhD research included comprehensive experimental work\r\nusing a generic swirl burner (with three different blade inserts to give different swirl\r\nnumbers) and has been used to examine the phenomena of flashback and blowoff in the\r\nswirl burner in the context of lean premixed combustion. Cylindrical and conical\r\nconfinements have been set up and assembled with the original design of the generic swirl\r\ncombustor. In addition to that, multi-fuel blends used during the experimental work include\r\npure methane, pure hydrogen, hydrogen / methane mixture, carbon dioxide/ methane\r\nmixture and coke oven gas.\r\nThe above investigational analysis has proved the flashback limits decrease when swirl\r\nnumbers decrease for the fuel blends that contain 30% or less hydrogen. Confinements\r\nwould improve the flashback limit as well.\r\nBlowoff limits improve with a lower swirl number and it is easier to recognise the gradual\r\nextinction of the flame under blowoff conditions. The use of exhaust confinement has\r\ncreated a considerable improvement in blowoff. Hydrogen enriched fuels can improve the\r\nblowoff limit in terms of increasing heat release, which is higher than heat release with\r\nnatural gas. However, the confinements complicate the flashback, especially when the fuel\r\ncontains a high percentage of hydrogen. The flashback propensity of the hydrogen/methane\r\nblends becomes quite strong. The most important features in gas turbines is the possibility\r\nof using different kinds of fuel. This matter has been discussed extensively in this project.\r\nBy matching flashback/blowoff limits, it has been found that for fuels containing up to 30%\r\nof hydrogen, the designer would be able to switch the same gas turbine combustor to multifuels\r\nwhilst producing the same power output.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abdulsada, Mohammed"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.304646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75489,"sim:weight":0.286214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631635,"sim:weight":0.239616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107056,"sim:weight":0.236339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75909,"sim:weight":0.234864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222990,"sim:weight":0.228546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107078,"sim:weight":0.223108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77006,"sim:weight":0.210296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9563,"sim:weight":0.208139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931561,"sim:weight":0.200788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631819,"sim:weight":0.18133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.164937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Yet, the received wisdom has been that humans choose irrationally and sub-optimally. This conclusion is largely based on studies in which participants are asked to make choices on the basis of explicit numerical information. Lately, our ability to make such high-level choices has been contrasted with our ability to make low-level (perceptual or perceptuo-motor) choices. Remarkably, we seem able to make near-optimal low-level choices. Taken at face value, the discrepancy gives rise to a perception-cognition gap. The gap implies, for example, that our ancestors were much better at choosing where to put their feet on a rocky ridge (a perceptuo-motor task), compared to choosing which prey to hunt (a cognitive task).The work reported herein probes this gap. There are many differences between literatures showing optimal and sub-optimal performance. The main approach taken here was to match low- and high-level tasks as closely as possible to eliminate such differences. When this is done one finds very little evidence for a perception-cognition gap. Moreover, once the standards of performance assessment of the respective literature are applied to data generated under such conditions it becomes apparent that the cause of the gap seems to lie in the standards themselves. When low-level standards are applied, human choice, whether low- or high-level, looks good. When high-level standards are applied, human choice, whether low- or high-level, looks rather poor. It is easy to see then, that applying high-level standards to high-level tasks, and low-level standards to low-level tasks, will give rise to a “gap”, with no or little actual difference in performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jarvstad, Andreas"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.25023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.232421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.232421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.228789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.212745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.210315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85083,"sim:weight":0.209439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108251,"sim:weight":0.202292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85303,"sim:weight":0.200555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75041,"sim:weight":0.198489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.188186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.181825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The standard model of Wnt/Beta-catenin signalling states that, upon\r\nstimulation by Wnt ligand, Beta-catenin accumulates and subsequently translocates to\r\nthe nucleus to activate TCF-dependent transcription of a variety of target genes,\r\nincluding oncogenes. However, the mechanisms regulating the nuclear localisation of\r\nBeta-catenin and its correlation with TCF-dependent transcription are poorly\r\nunderstood.\r\nIn order to identify novel regulators of Beta-catenin levels and localisation in Wnt\r\nsignalling imaging-based high-throughput knockout screens were developed in a Wnt\r\ninducible cell line, in addition to a cancer cell line in the presence of normal and\r\ndownregulated APC.

A particularly relevant stream of research to explain the situational effect on consumer environmental behaviour is the Behavioural Perspective Model (BPM). A key insight of the BPM is of the anticipated benefit consumers acquire and the impact of the environment that surrounds consumer choice. The aim of the research is to interpret consumer environmental behaviour across different situations in a systematic way by using the BPM. Due to the exploratory nature of the study, a mixed method approach was used among Cardiff consumers. The first study involved standardized open-ended interviews (N\u003d30). Panel experts were also invited to take part in the BPM Contingency Definition Test. The second studies were conducted via survey (N\u003d200), which provided data on 1,600 consumer situations. The findings from the consumers‘ verbal responses to descriptions of eight consumer environmental situations confirm the predictions raised by the BPM interpretation of consumer choice. Mehrabian and Russell‘s affective (Pleasure, Arousal, Dominance) and behavioural variables (Approach and Avoidance) showed significant main effects. The one-way ANOVA and Tukey‘s HSD analysis provide support for the patterns of the affective and behavioural variables for the BPM contingencies categories. Furthermore, the actual differences in the variables means scores of the groups were large (eta squared \u003d between 0.1 and 0.4). The discriminant analysis justified the predicted capability of the BPM. Two-way interaction effects between affective variables were also identified. In summary, this study shows that the application of the model is not only empirically limited to familiar themes of consumer research but also applicable to different consumer environmental behaviours.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abu Hasan, Zuha"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108946,"sim:weight":0.453254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108980,"sim:weight":0.385884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176822,"sim:weight":0.369206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76564,"sim:weight":0.292334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15270,"sim:weight":0.283632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85837,"sim:weight":0.277236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58899,"sim:weight":0.250682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60467,"sim:weight":0.241058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77309,"sim:weight":0.2053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57376,"sim:weight":0.186333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.184184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77056,"sim:weight":0.181039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388776,"sim:weight":0.180993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87201,"sim:weight":0.179154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.153199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58876,"sim:weight":0.14845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.14748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75903,"sim:weight":0.130692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.117804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.117569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The model assumes a\r\ntwo-phase elastic composite, derived from an Eshelby solution and the Mori-Tanaka\r\nhomogenization method, to which circular microcracks are added. A multi-component\r\nrough crack contact model is employed to simulate normal and shear behaviour of rough\r\nmicrocrack surfaces. It is shown, based on numerical predictions of uniaxial, biaxial and\r\ntriaxial behaviour that the model captures key characteristics of concrete behaviour. An\r\nimportant aspect of the approach taken in this work is the adherence to a mechanistic\r\nmodelling philosophy. In this regard the model is distinctly more rigorously mechanistic\r\nthan its more phenomenological predecessors.\r\nFollowing this philosophy, a new more comprehensive crack-plane model is\r\ndescribed which could be applied to crack-planes in the above model. In this model the\r\ncrack surface is idealised as a series of conical teeth and corresponding recesses of\r\nvariable height and slope. Based on this geometrical characterization, an effective\r\ncontact function is derived to relate the contact stresses on the sides of the teeth to the\r\nnet crack-plane stresses. Plastic embedment and frictional sliding are simulated using a\r\nlocal plasticity model in which the plastic surfaces are expressed in terms of the contact\r\nsurface function. Numerical simulations of several direct shear tests indicate a good\r\nperformance of the model. The incorporation of this crack-plane model in the overall\r\nconstitutive model is the next step in the development of the latter.\r\nComputational aspects such as contact related numerical instability and accuracy\r\nof spherical integration rules employed in the constitutive model are also discussed.

A longitudinal methodology was adopted where participants had an initial assessment with a follow-up after 12 months. Body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure and total/HDL cholesterol levels were measured and the Framingham 10-year cardiovascular risk was estimated and communicated to patients. Demographic details and lifestyle information (smoking, alcohol, diet and exercise) were obtained via self-complete questionnaires at each consultation. A total of 172 individuals accessed the service and had either a brief assessment (n\u003d26) without the calculation of the Framingham score or a full VRA (n\u003d146). Mean age was 60 years (±10.3), 59% were female and 25% (37/146) were at high risk (\u003e20%) of developing cardiovascular disease. High satisfaction with the VRA was obtained via an anonymous questionnaire provided immediately after the initial consultation (74% response rate). The short-term outcomes of the service (including recall of advice, lifestyle improvement and/or making the visit to their GP if they were referred) were reported through a semi-structured telephone interview two weeks after the initial assessment. In total 105/172 (61%) who attended the twelve-month follow-up had results of the two assessments compared using paired Student’s t-test. There was a statistically significant increase in mean HDL 0.08 mmol/L (95% CI 0.02 to 0.14) and a statically significant reduction in mean systolic BP -8.5 mmHg (95% CI -11.0 to -5.9), diastolic BP -7.7 mmHg (95% CI -10.4 to -5.0) and Framingham score -1.07 (95% CI -1.9 to -0.2). A comparison between Framingham and QRISK2 algorithms showed the importance of using the most accurate tool available in estimating cardiovascular risk.

In Chapter 1 a review of literature revealed several unanswered questions\r\nExperiments 1 and 2 explored whether attention is paid to entire dimensions or to individual stimuli. In a test, pigeons learnt a discrimination based upon previously relevant stimuli more rapidly than they did a discrimination based on previously irrelevant stimuli. This was evident when discriminations were based on colours that were close or far apart on the spectrum.\r\nExperiment 3 attempted to detect latent inhibition in pigeons. No effect was observed; findings were attributed to the amount of attention paid to a stimulus being determined by the degree of responding to it. In Experiment 4 compounds in which components were superimposed on the other eliminated the effects seen in Experiment 3.\r\nExperiment 5 explored whether more attention is paid to reliable or unreliable predictors of outcome. No evidence was found of greater attention paid to partially-reinforced stimuli. Experiment 6 found pigeons learnt more rapidly about previously reinforced stimuli when accompanied by stimuli with low associative strength than with stimuli with high associative strength.\r\nExperiment 7 explored whether attention increased to previously non-reinforced stimuli from a discrimination. No evidence was found. Experiment 8 asked the same question but paired previously non-reinforced and previously irrelevant stimuli during Stage 2. The discrimination based upon non-reinforced stimuli was learnt more rapidly than the discrimination based upon irrelevant stimuli.\r\nFrom the findings presented it seems attentional changes were masked by the amount of time a pigeon spent pecking at a stimulus. The exception was the final experiment. It seems attentional changes as envisaged by Mackintosh (1975a) may occur, but are only apparent when the effect of the amount of pecking is reduced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Natalie"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":29050,"sim:weight":0.45974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.355615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645776,"sim:weight":0.325436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.286011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.2779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.2779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.277102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.276237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.265174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.264743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.264743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.259953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.259953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76845,"sim:weight":0.218123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":361074,"sim:weight":0.217289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85405,"sim:weight":0.213186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76111,"sim:weight":0.173129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.172184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631477,"sim:weight":0.159764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85827,"sim:weight":0.157928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This extends earlier work, which considered the case with no mass transfer. For disturbances in the genuine base flow, where radially inhomogeneity is retained, mass injection at the disk surface led to behaviour that remained qualitatively similar to that which was found when there was no mass transfer. The initial development of disturbances within the absolutely unstable region involved temporal growth and upstream propagation, as should be anticipated for an absolute instability. However, this did not persist indefinitely. Just as for the case without mass transfer, the simulation results suggested that convective behaviour would eventually dominate, for all the Reynolds numbers investigated. In marked contrast, the results obtained for flows with mass suction indicate a destabilization due to the effects of the base-flow radial inhomogeneity. It was possible to identify disturbances excited within the absolutely unstable region that grew continually, with a temporal growth rate that increased as the disturbance evolved. The strong locally stabilizing effect of suction on the absolute instability, which gives rise to large increases in critical Reynolds numbers, appears to be obtainable only at the expense of introducing a new form of global instability. Analogous forms of global behaviour can be found in impulse solutions of the linearized complex Ginzburg–Landau equation. These solutions were deployed to interpret and make comparisons with the numerical simulation results. They illustrate how the long-term behaviour of a disturbance can be determined by the precise balance between radial increases in temporal growth rates, corresponding shifts in temporal frequencies and diffusion/dispersion effects. This balance provides some insight into why disturbances that are absolutely unstable, for the homogenized version of the rotating-disk boundary-layer flow, may become, in the genuine radially inhomogeneous flow, either globally stable or globally unstable, depending on the level of mass transfer that is applied at the disk surface.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thomas, Christian","Davies, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1017/S0022112010003563","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":31441,"sim:weight":0.345106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24687,"sim:weight":0.322806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27631,"sim:weight":0.30622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30420,"sim:weight":0.305351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31804,"sim:weight":0.29622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.295955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26767,"sim:weight":0.293267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23553,"sim:weight":0.290489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29453,"sim:weight":0.249043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76500,"sim:weight":0.249036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8335,"sim:weight":0.241077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268054,"sim:weight":0.237532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.225925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9548422,"sim:weight":0.221035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631632,"sim:weight":0.216593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2309348,"sim:weight":0.19981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.192409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9563,"sim:weight":0.191752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27227,"sim:weight":0.190692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27145,"sim:weight":0.1873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These bulletins embody discourses of the national on a structural level through their public service remit and their position in the programme schedule. They also evoke the nation in and through their content—in particular in the context of the coverage of migration. The central line of enquiry of this thesis is focussed on the potentially problematic consequences of the interrelation of discourses of migration with discourses of the nation. That this is a question of how they interrelate rather than whether rests on three theoretical assumptions: discourses of nation represent a form of identification; identification is the outcome of encounter with and potentially exclusion of the Other; migration is a discourse of encounter. Two further assumptions relate to the current historical moment and the news coverage under analysis: discourses of the nation have increasingly come under pressure; and yet, public discourses do not fully recognise or even acknowledge this, instead insist on the nation‟s continued unchanged relevance. The key question is: Under what contingencies is migration positioned as an excluded Other in relation to theses imagined community discourses? The thesis relates these issues to wider questions about the possibility for a cosmopolitan ethic. It theorises that certain logics of narrow nationality are a key determinants, but have to be understood as variable rather than as constant. The first two chapters of section 1 develop these key theoretical assumptions as well as some methodological concerns. The third chapter provides some topical context and background for the main data set: material collected during six months of media monitoring in 2006 on three news bulletins with a public service remit. The data is analysed in section 2 across three case studies. The first considers so-called illegal migration in relation to questions of space, attempting to trace the boundaries of the nation. The second moves from the boundary to the inside of the nation and looks at the changing nature of citizenship. The third case study focuses on the conditions under which journalists and migrants encounter each other.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gross, Bernhard"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.355237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.28754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.286054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222985,"sim:weight":0.268527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108887,"sim:weight":0.254291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.251329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.250636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.250636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.249475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.220734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.214189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76022,"sim:weight":0.209515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76873,"sim:weight":0.208823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76631,"sim:weight":0.199701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.199606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316484,"sim:weight":0.17954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Sampling was semi-continuous for a year (2008/2009). Available meteorological data included wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and rainfall. In addition, vehicle counts and speeds were available at the site.\r\nThe mean particle number concentration (PNC) at the traffic site was 40,600 particles cm-3 (32,000 cm-3 median), averaged over the year-long semi-continuous sampling period.

Keratometric analogues were found to be significantly different and in addition provided spurious vertical anterior ocular surface (AOS) profiles. These findings revealed a need to establish an accurate model.\r\n\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) potentially offers the best opportunity to image the entire AOS structure. However, preliminary studies in this thesis demonstrated that the use of a 3-Tesla MRI scanner was unable to obtain sufficiently resolute data to meet requirements.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, ocular impression taking techniques were adopted during the remainder of this work to acquire the AOS data. Eye casts from impression moulds were scanned using active laser triangulation and virtual 3-dimensional surfaces rendered. Further investigations defined the most suitable material for impression taking and the amount of deformation of the AOS caused by the procedure. The ocular impression casting and scanning process was examined for accuracy and reliability. \r\n\r\nThis protocol was used to sample a population of normal white European eyes in order to establish a database and define wide-field AOS variability. Volumetric and 2-dimensional topographic profiles were extracted from the digital 3-dimensional representation obtained, allowing for the analysis of point-to-point curvature differences. For the first time, the entire AOS shape has been defined with known accuracy. In addition, effects of myopic refractive error and gender are presented.  This data is of potential importance to ophthalmic surgeons, ocularists, contact lens practitioners, vision scientists and researchers, in the form of a digital archive of normal white European wide-field AOS topography as a reference source.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15010,"sim:weight":0.258282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75288,"sim:weight":0.250088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5532,"sim:weight":0.229799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.204235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76320,"sim:weight":0.20133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85313,"sim:weight":0.197574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.196628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.196628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.193794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931836,"sim:weight":0.191318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931810,"sim:weight":0.191028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.184192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.184192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.18341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108986,"sim:weight":0.144183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176877,"sim:weight":0.143448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.139998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632050,"sim:weight":0.136721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821123,"sim:weight":0.119859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A preliminary study","bibo:abstract":"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DN) is the most common complication in diabetes\r\nmellitus affecting up to 50% of this population. Foot ulceration in DN is a major health\r\nproblem, often leading to lower-limb amputations and increased mortality rates. A\r\ncombination of gait and microcirculatory alterations increases the risk of foot\r\nulcerations in DN subjects. DN is also linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular\r\ndiseases and poor quality of life (QOL). Physical activity (PA) plays an important role\r\nin the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus. Thus, PA has been associated with\r\npositive changes in glucose control, obesity and blood pressure. However, almost all the\r\nstudies investigating PA interventions in subjects with diabetes mellitus have been\r\ncarried out in individuals without neuropathic complications, whereas the effect of PA\r\nprogrammes in DN subjects is still unknown. In addition to that, the vast majority of\r\nstudies have investigated the association between PA and health problems commonly\r\nlinked to type 2 diabetes whereas the relationship between PA and additional problems\r\nassociated with DN (i.e. risk of foot ulceration, sensory neuropathy or QOL) have\r\nreceived minimal attention. Therefore, the principal aim of this study was twofold: 1) to\r\nquantify differences between DN and healthy individuals in the primary pathologies that\r\nmay co-exist in DN, with special attention to gait and microcirculation due to their\r\nassociation with foot problems; and 2) to evaluate the overall effect of a PA\r\nintervention, based on strengthening and foot mobility exercises, in modifying the\r\nprimary pathologies linked to DN. Prior to the main study, a number of reliability\r\nstudies were carried out to determine the reliability of some the methods used in the\r\nmain part of the study.\r\nPreliminary studies\r\nThree reliability studies were carried in the present investigation. One study\r\ninvestigated the reliability (within- between-day) of near infrared spectroscopy to\r\nquantify muscular blood flow and oxygen consumption in the lower limb using a\r\nvenous occlusion method (microcirculation). The other two studies investigated the\r\nreliability (within-day) of two different approaches to calculate the time differences\r\nbetween electromyography data and mechanical output (force) (electromechanical\r\ndelay) during different conditions. Substantial reliability (ICC\u003e0.6) or higher was found\r\nin all the three studies. Electromechanical delay values for the distal leg muscles were\r\nsignificantly higher in DN subjects compared to healthy individuals.\r\nMain study\r\nThe main study was composed of two parts. Part 1 (cross-sectional study) investigated\r\ngroup differences between subjects with DN (N\u003d53) and healthy individuals (N\u003d25)\r\nwhereas part 2 (intervention study) investigated group differences over time between\r\ntwo groups of subjects with DN; one participating in a 16 week PA programme (N\u003d21)\r\nand the other as controls (N\u003d20). Both studies followed the same experimental protocol\r\nand investigated the same domains (general health, gait, microcirculation and QOL).\r\nIV\r\nCross-sectional study\r\nThis study confirmed that DN is a complex condition that affects all the domains\r\nmeasured in the present investigation. Thus, the DN group showed significant\r\ndifferences (p\u003c0.05) in: 1) traditional cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure); 2)\r\ngait (spatial-temporal characteristics, forefoot foot pressures and muscular activity\r\npatterns); 3) microcirculation (blood flow and oxygen consumption in response to\r\nexercise stress); and 4) QOL compared to the healthy group. Interestingly, the present\r\ninvestigation showed that EMG alterations in DN may be associated with changes in\r\nplantar foot pressures and consequently with higher risk of foot complications.\r\nFurthermore, results from the present study showed for the first time impairments in\r\nexercise-induced microcirculatory responses in subjects with DN compared to healthy\r\nindividuals. These alterations in the microcirculation were observed both in the\r\nmuscular vasodilatory capacity as well as in the ability of the muscle to consume\r\noxygen.\r\nIntervention study\r\nThis study demonstrated for the first time that 16 weeks of a PA programme based on\r\nstrengthening and foot mobility exercises can influence a number of aspects of health\r\nthat are altered in DN subjects. The most remarkable finding was that the exercise\r\nprogramme improved sensory neuropathy (p\u003d0.027) whilst 16 weeks of strength\r\ntraining did not produce significant changes in strength levels (p\u003e0.115 at least) in the\r\nDN subjects. In addition to this results from the present investigation showed that a well\r\ncontrolled strengthening training program does have beneficial effects (p\u003c0.05) on the\r\nmicrocirculation, obesity, blood pressure as well as on mental health QOL. On the other\r\nhand, the exercise program did not seem to have a substantial effect on any aspect of\r\ngait and HbA1c. Importantly, no adverse effects related to the intervention were reported\r\nin any of the volunteers who participated in the physical activity program.\r\nConclusions\r\nThe present study demonstrated that DN is a condition that affects different aspects of\r\nhealth, of which some are modifiable by a well controlled PA programme (i.e. QOL,\r\nblood pressure and weight loss). Furthermore, the intervention seemed to trigger\r\npositive adaptations in the microcirculation, in particular in the ability of the muscle to\r\nrecover from a stress condition (exercise stress). However, the most striking finding was\r\nthat the intervention improved sensory neuropathy in individuals with DN. Surprisingly,\r\nchanges in sensory neuropathy did not coincide with changes in muscular strength. This\r\nsuggests that the lack of muscular adaptation to a PA programme may be caused by\r\nintrinsic changes in the muscle and not necessarily to lack of efferent muscle\r\nstimulation. In summary, results from the present investigation highlighted 1) the\r\nimportance of PA as a therapeutic tool in subjects with DN to modify outcome\r\nmeasures associated with type 2 diabetes as well as sensory neuropathy; 2) the need to\r\ninvestigate the effect of PA on DN subjects to challenge the assumption that similar\r\nadaptations may occur in DN compared to individuals with type 2 diabetes and no\r\nneuropathic complications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meana-Esteban, Alejandro"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":57381,"sim:weight":0.363167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77153,"sim:weight":0.328417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75306,"sim:weight":0.31279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10910,"sim:weight":0.289965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75274,"sim:weight":0.240445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.236073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76297,"sim:weight":0.232278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.224336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.219102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75534,"sim:weight":0.216659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76594,"sim:weight":0.214687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.205921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.205894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.20264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.196605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.193223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631776,"sim:weight":0.191293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222790,"sim:weight":0.183542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.182196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631760,"sim:weight":0.175943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using analytic and numerical methods we determine the conditions relating to g, λ, and θ which result in three types of emission profile. These consist of: type-I profiles, in which emissions continue to rise but at a reduced rate; type-II profiles which fall, attain a minimum, and subsequently rise from a lower base; and type-III profiles which continue to fall over a forecasting period. For all profiles we determine the total reduction in vehicle emissions arising from revised standards, and the sensitivity of the total emissions to changes in their determining factors. Data from the UK are used to illustrate the approach which is extended in a wide range of sensitivity tests to explore differences in emission profiles between advanced industrialised and rapidly developing countries. We show that while it may be necessary for all countries to rely on both technological and behavioural policy instruments to reduce emissions, in advanced industrialised countries it may be more effective to improve emission standards, while, in contrast, moderating the rate of traffic growth may be relatively more effective in the rapidly industrialising world. The profiles resulting from the change in emission standards accompanying the introduction of catalytic converters are used to illustrate the general approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, Shin Shim","Williams, Huw Cadwaladr William Lloyd"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1068/a3986","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9001537,"sim:weight":0.363972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000413,"sim:weight":0.332482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.199965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These initiatives are intended to promote \u0027joined-up government\u0027 and holistic service delivery -- two of the hallmarks of New Labour\u0027s approach to public service improvement. To date there has been very little analysis of the ways in which local authorities are approaching this task at a corporate level. The authors examine the theory and practice of joining up policymaking and service delivery in local government. They draw upon an analysis of the perspectives of key actors involved in the formulation and implementation of current local government reforms at the national level and the experiences of a sample of authorities that have been among the most active in seeking to integrate the various elements of the LGMA at local level. The evidence suggests that the superficially attractive logic of more integrated policymaking and service provision, which runs so strongly through current reforms, belies the multidimensional nature of joined-up working. The presentation of the LGMA as a coherent package of reforms therefore disguises the degree to which different forms of joining up may conflict. In particular, the push for closer vertical integration between local and central government, with ever-tighter control being exerted from the centre over priorities and performance, is seen as constraining progress towards more effective horizontal joined-up working at a local level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cowell, Richard John Westley","Martin, Stephen James"],"dc:date":"2003-04-01","doi":"10.1068/c0135","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As a consequence, it becomes necessary to develop appraisal and evaluation tools capable of assessing the achievements of joined-up policy interventions and their broader impacts on decision making and delivery across a diverse number of stakeholders.

Rather than assuming that evaluation is influential because of the intrinsic methodological veracity of the technique—that is, because it measures ‘the truth’ of our environmental predicament—it is more useful to view the adoption of evaluation tools in terms of their contested translation into decision-making settings. This is demonstrated by the growing use of the ‘ecological footprint’ (EF), which has been presented as a methodologically robust yet intuitive tool for guiding decisions. By following the use of the EF within a UK local government setting (Cardiff Council), one can see that its influence depended only partly on claims to technical credibility; it also depended upon an array of other institutional and personal commitments. The extent to which the EF was translated into policy settings reflected the way in which it had been institutionalised as an ‘obligatory passage point’ (after Latour) in decision-making arrangements, and careful representation of the implications of footprint measures. Overall, the credibility of the EF—as with other evaluation techniques—can be seen as a complex product of internal properties and institutional settings, but also of wider network-building activities which seek to cement the status of footprint calculations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Collins, Andrea Jayne","Cowell, Richard John Westley","Flynn, Andrew Colin"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1068/a4124","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84852,"sim:weight":0.253892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.186775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.169745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper argues that debates over biosecurity can be conceptualised as arguments over the ability to regulate flows of disease and the constructions of space they adopt. Data from parliamentary inquiries and interviews are used to show how attempts to institutionalise forms of biosecurity emerge from a delicate balance of prescribed and negotiated spaces configured by a host of social, natural, and material agents.

Some biosecurity practices are seemingly mundane\r\nbut with broad consequences (like the use of disinfectants at farm gates to halt the\r\nmovement of foot and mouth viruses). Some practices take us to a world of high-\r\ntechnology surveillance and cutting-edge science (like theWorld Health Organization\u0027s\r\nCentre for Strategic Health Operations, SHOC). All of the cases involve attempts to\r\nmonitor, regulate, and/or halt the movements of various forms of life. Sometimes the\r\nfocus is on animals or plants; often it is microbes. Sometimes the concern is triggered\r\nby disasters or `accidents\u0027 (Law, 2006); at other times the cause for concern is a form\r\nof warfare or terrorism. Anticipation and preparedness for such events become part of\r\nthe affective register of biosecurity.

The aspatial and target-led nature of these approaches around the attainment of fixed skill sets is discussed and then contrasted with educationalist literatures which provide an alternative pedagogical approach to learning. That is, one that places a much greater emphasis on ‘learners’ as individuals and ‘learning’ as achieved through experience. The role and influence of people in place are implicit within these ‘learner-centred’ models. This reflects an understanding of the need to approach learning strategies in a way that relates to people’s everyday lives. Drawing on ongoing empirical research conducted in the English town of Stroud (Gloucestershire, UK), we demonstrate some of the insights which can be gained from understanding skills and knowledge for sustainable communities in the context of these more experiential and process-orientated approaches. We do so by looking at the accounts and practices not of professionals, but of community members who are actively engaged with sustainable communities initiatives. We explore the relationships between their knowledge and understandings of sustainability and how they have sought to encompass and actively develop principles of sustainable communities as part of their everyday lives.","bibo:AuthorList":["Franklin, Alexandra","Newton, Julie","Middleton, Jennie","Marsden, Terry Keith"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1068/a426","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This paper explores the politics of sustainability through the prism of three major issues. First, the carbon-labelling controversy is used to highlight the potential conflict between green campaigners (who extol the benefits of local food) and social justice campaigners (who support fairly traded food from afar). Second, school-food reform is used to demonstrate that local and global food, far from being mutually exclusive options, can both be part of the constitution of a sustainable food system if global food is framed in cosmopolitan terms. Third, the paper engages with the politics of care literature to explore a question that underlies the above issues, namely, how and why we care for others. It is argued that ethical consumerism, a key part of a progressive narrative of care, is not sufficient to counter the challenge of climate change—the greatest threat to ecological integrity and social justice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morgan, Kevin John"],"dc:date":"2010-06-28","doi":"10.1068/a42364","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"K MORGAN.

However, these data still remain deficient in detail especially with respect to the fine-grained property-level structural attributes that form the basis of housing-market models and simulations. This lack of detail is hindering the development of house-price models, the validation of housing-market theories, and restricting the quality of empirical input into urban planning. A methodology is developed for deriving estimates of floor area for individual properties from the integration of Ordnance Survey Mastermap data and Environment Agency LiDAR data for an area in the city of Cardiff, Wales. Floor area is an important determinant of house price and a fundamental variable in housing-market models. The estimates are validated against measures of floor area obtained from an estate-agent survey of a large sample of properties. The research investigates the reasons for the differences in the estimates and the implications for the methodology. The paper concludes with a discussion about how the methodology can be developed and some future research applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Orford, Scott"],"dc:date":"2009-12-15","doi":"10.1068/b35082","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67390,"sim:weight":0.244113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although research identifies factors that affect electoral participation, we still know little about how electors in a specific location respond to opportunities to vote for different kinds of local, national, and supranational institutions. This paper addresses this issue by analysing the relative rates of turnout at local, parliamentary, and European elections within three time periods for the London Borough of Brent. It uses turnout data for individual polling districts to investigate whether relative differences in turnout are sustained across time, whether polling districts perform consistently or not for different types of elections and whether variations in turnout are related to marginality. The results indicate that turnout at different types of elections is not stable even within tightly constrained time periods and that there are statistically significant differences in the relative rates of participation between polling districts. Geographically, the differences in relative rates of turnout appear to be spatially clustered, particularly with respect to local elections and this may reflect an increase in the concentration of party campaigning in marginal wards.","bibo:AuthorList":["Orford, Scott","Rallings, Colin","Thrasher, Michael","Borisyuk, Galina"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1068/a39169","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Recent research has shown that voter turnout can be sensitive to geographical factors relating to the costs of voting, such as distance travelled to the polling station; government policy has stated that accessibility is a key criterion when siting polling stations. With this paper we directly address these important issues by predicting the probability of electoral turnout to parliamentary, local, and European elections when polling stations are resited to optimal and suboptimal locations based on polling district voter density in the London Borough of Brent. The differences in these predicted probabilities show that, for some polling districts, resiting the polling place could improve the probability of turnout by up to five percentage points.

Despite differences in research focus and approach, scholars agree that quality is the outcome of a contingent and so far underresearched process of negotiation that entails and determines relations of power in the food chain. To understand the nature and implications of the relationship between quality and power in the food sector, this paper focuses on the recent ‘quality revolution’ implemented in the school meals system in Rome. Based on the analysis of documentary material and qualitative data collected through formal and informal interviews, the paper examines the process through which city authorities have integrated different (and at times contrasting) quality conventions. The analysis shows that procurement policies such as those implemented in Rome have the power to create an ‘economy of quality’ that can deliver the economic, environmental, and social benefits of sustainable development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sonnino, Roberta"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1068/a40112","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"R SONNINO.

Their paper models the emergence of urban centers brought about by household and firm location decisions in the context of spatially differentiated labor and land market interactions. Their approach is an analytical one that seeks to characterize the equilibrium values of the system. In contrast, we employ an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach that seeks to replicate the individual household and firm behaviors that lead to equilibrium or nonequilibrium outcomes. The F – O model has little to say about what happens outside of equilibrium, while the ABM approach is preoccupied with this question and is particularly well suited to address questions of path dependency and bounded rationality that lie well beyond the scope of the F – O original. We demonstrate that the urban outcomes that emerge depend critically upon the bidding behavior of agents and the institutional context within which their decisions are made.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heikkila, Eric J","Wang, Yiming"],"dc:date":"2009-04-06","doi":"10.1068/b34080","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66949,"sim:weight":0.352296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.237839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25806,"sim:weight":0.236016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.223799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5306169,"sim:weight":0.217707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26790,"sim:weight":0.212553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.21132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.204956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85268,"sim:weight":0.198661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For every 1% increase in poverty rate, the chance is raised by 4.4%.

Three positions are proposed as heuristics for understanding politico-administrative relations in devolved Wales: these are administrative persistence, capacity-building and bureaucratic capture. Rather than set these dynamics against each other, the case study of the civil service in Wales demonstrates the value of reasoning in terms of a mix of administrative, political and managerial pressures, requiring the development of hybrid responses and skills. Although the institutional capacity-building dynamic clearly had the ascendancy during the first decade, as the post-devolution Welsh polity gradually becomes more settled, there is likely to be a revival of more generic administrative and/or managerial concerns.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cole, Alistair Mark"],"dc:date":"2012-08","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-856X.2011.00470.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.245569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.160988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.118109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These cases reveal an original attempt to craft a political discourse based on public sector productivity and state puissance.

These comprise reservoirs units affected by\r\nmulti‐scale compartmentalisation resultant from stratigraphic, structural and/or diagenetic\r\nprocesses that compromise the lateral and/or vertical connectivity of permeable strata.\r\nA 3D seismic dataset from the deepwater Espírito Santo Basin (SE Brazil) was\r\nanalysed to assess and quantify the architectural elements that influence the\r\ncompartmentalisation of reservoir units. Mass‐Transport Deposits (MTDs) have growing\r\nimportance on reservoir studies as they highly impact the compartmentalisation of\r\ncontemporaneous reservoir‐prone turbidite strata. More significant compartmentalisation\r\noccurs in areas with higher MTD proportion, which are associated to wider dimensional\r\nranges of laterally limited turbidites. However, salt diapirs constitute important barriers for\r\nMTD erosion, thus aiding the preservation of reservoir‐prone turbidites. The internal\r\ncompositional heterogeneities and cohese strata on remnant and rafted blocks identified\r\nwithin the studied MTDs constitute important fluid flow or accumulation compartments,\r\nparticularly when linked to underlying permeable faults.\r\nSubmarine channels in Palaeocene and Neogene Units comprise important\r\nreservoir‐prone strata, thus it is crucial to understand their spatial distribution. Large\r\nchannels are focused along the axis of salt‐withdrawal basins, whereas in sub‐units with\r\nnumerous smaller channels these are laterally scattered across the basin. A new\r\nquantitative method used in this study shows that channel confluences and topographic\r\nconfinement control significantly the density and spatial distribution patterns of submarine\r\nchannels. A novel classification for submarine channel confluences is proposed, based on\r\nchannel morphology and distribution of sediment facies within the tributaries.\r\nThe key aim of this thesis was to undertake a seismic‐scale qualitative and quantitative\r\nanalysis of the compartmentalisation of reservoir units on the Brazilian margin using\r\nmethodologies that can be applied to other continental margins worldwide. As such, the\r\nresults of this study can provide significant contributions for hydrocarbon exploration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gamboa, Davide Alexandre"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Many occidental studies regarding CSR have concentrated on natural environmental management and the influence of social and culture differences on such management. However, such research has not as yet been undertaken to any significant extent in the Malaysian context. To fill this gap, the present study therefore investigated environmental management in Malaysia’s banking sector, and the methods deployed by bank managers in evaluating and accommodating environmental risk in the credit assessment process. Malaysia was chosen as the study location because it is a multi racial country and has a dual banking system (conventional and Islamic banking). These characteristics enabled the study to investigate the influence of cultural and institutional differences on credit evaluation orientations, stakeholders’ group activism and perceptions, and general CSR orientations. To achieve the study aims, a questionnaire survey was designed to collect data from managers and executives in corporate banking departments whose main task is to evaluate loan applications, especially in project financing. The findings obtained from analyses of the data collected suggested that Malaysia’s banking sector has, in general, good environmental management practice. However, local banks’ environmental management practice falls short of that of international banks. It was also found that Islamic banks have better environmental management practice than conventional banks. As regards the credit evaluation process, the study findings suggested that environmental criteria are of secondary importance compared to financial and economic criteria. The study also found that cultural and institutional differences influenced the attitude of bank managers towards environmental management practice. Thus, to improve such practice in the future, these factors should be taken account of in the environmental policy development process if future rules and regulations, including environmental laws, are to gain widespread acceptance across racial and religious boundaries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ali Basah, Mohamad"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.454728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108811,"sim:weight":0.451064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108531,"sim:weight":0.431564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.367677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108933,"sim:weight":0.340326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108688,"sim:weight":0.34009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85709,"sim:weight":0.337308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108989,"sim:weight":0.312646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340559,"sim:weight":0.307939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85823,"sim:weight":0.303401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85832,"sim:weight":0.289614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108312,"sim:weight":0.287475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108236,"sim:weight":0.287009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.276325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108491,"sim:weight":0.275858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85702,"sim:weight":0.275376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.251833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109019,"sim:weight":0.249194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108993,"sim:weight":0.247646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84885,"sim:weight":0.241454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

IMRT is an advanced\r\nform of radiotherapy demanding extensive verification procedures to ensure\r\ntreatments are delivered accurately. This requires comprehensive sampling of the\r\ncomplex dose distributions impacting on the tumour volume and radiationsensitive\r\n‘organs at risk’.\r\nThis work has focused on the use of electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) for\r\nverification purposes. Modern EPIDs are composed of a scintillator and an\r\namorphous silicon detector panel with an array of photodiodes and thin film\r\ntransistors. They are primarily used to verify the patient position during\r\ntreatment by capturing transmission images, but they also have the potential to be\r\nused as efficient dose verification tools of high spatial resolution.\r\nTwo complementary dose verification methods have been developed. One\r\napproach involves the calculation of portal dose using Monte Carlo (MC) methods.\r\nA MC model of the linear accelerator, in combination with the EPID, enables the\r\ndose to the detector to be predicted accurately and compared directly with\r\nacquired images. An alternative approach has also been developed. This utilises a\r\nclinical treatment planning system (TPS) to calculate the dose at the detector\r\nlevel, and convert this to predicted EPID intensity by application of a series of\r\nderived correction factors.\r\nAdditionally, there have been numerous publications in the literature detailing\r\nproblems in dosimetry caused by non-uniform backscatter to the imager from the\r\nmodel of detector support arm used in this work. Two novel methods to correct\r\nfor this issue have been developed, a MC modelling solution and a matrix-based\r\ncorrection.\r\nThese developed methods for IMRT dose verification have been applied both prior\r\nto and during treatment. When applied to pre-treatment verification, the MC\r\nsolution is accurate to the 2%, 2 mm level (an average of 96% of points passing\r\ngamma criteria of 2%, 2 mm) and the TPS based method is accurate to the 3%, 3\r\nmm level (an average of 98% of points passing gamma criteria of 3%, 3 mm). Both\r\nverification methods achieve acceptable verification results during treatment at\r\nthe 5%, 5 mm level (average gamma pass rates of 97% and 96% being achieved\r\nfor the MC and TPS based solutions respectively). Furthermore, in initial clinical\r\nstudies, both techniques have identified dose delivery errors due to changes in\r\npatient position or patient anatomy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cufflin, Rebecca Sian"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69902,"sim:weight":0.319392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26194,"sim:weight":0.192969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84861,"sim:weight":0.17574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795333,"sim:weight":0.15875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.129218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The links between devices are dynamic and often short-lived. Therefore, disseminating data from a source to recipients with a quality of service guarantee and efficiency is a very challenging problem. Furthermore, the interactions between devices are based on opportunity and are dependent on the devices mobility, which have extreme diverse patterns.\r\nThe aim of this thesis is to investigate dissemination of data in opportunistic networks. In particular two conflicting objectives are studied: minimising the overhead costs and maximising the information coverage over time. We also take into account the effects of mobility. Extensive computer simulation is developed to explore models for information dissemination and mobility. On top of existing mobility models (i.e. Random Walk, Random, Waypoint and Gauss Markov) a hybrid model is derived from the Random Waypoint and Gauss Markov mobility models. The effect on mobility model on dissemination performance is found to be highly significant. This is based on sensitivity analysis on mobility and node density.\r\nWe first consider different baseline push techniques for data dissemination. We propose four different push techniques, namely Pure Push, Greedy, L-Push and Spray and Relay to analyse the impact of different push techniques to the information dissemination performances. The results present different trade-offs between objectives. As a strategy to manage overheads, we consider controlling to which nodes information is pushed to by establishing a social network between devices. A logical social network can be built between mobile devices if they repeatedly see each other, and can be defined in different ways. This is important because it shows how content may potentially flow to devices. We explore the effects of mobility for different definitions of the social network. This shows how different local criteria for defining links in a social network lead to different social structures. Finally we consider the effect of combining the social structure and intelligent push techniques to further improve the data dissemination performance in opportunistic networks. We discover that prioritising pushing over a social network is able to minimise the overhead costs but it introduces a dissemination delay.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lenando, Halikul"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1549530,"sim:weight":0.303756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26670,"sim:weight":0.273137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.266333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70126,"sim:weight":0.243568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931258,"sim:weight":0.234394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931241,"sim:weight":0.216678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91436,"sim:weight":0.201532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here we show that γ-synuclein is nutritionally regulated in murine adipocytes and that γ-synuclein deficiency protects mice from high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and associated metabolic complications. When compared to HFD-fed wild type mice, HFD-fed γ-synuclein deficient mice display increased lipolysis, lipid oxidation and energy expenditure, and reduced adipocyte hypertrophy. γ-synuclein null adipocytes express more ATGL, a key lipolytic enzyme, and contain fewer SNARE complexes of a type involved in lipid droplet fusion. Thus, γ-synuclein may co-ordinately affect both lipid droplet formation and lipid hydrolysis. We also find that γ-synuclein deficiency causes alterations in lipid classes and fatty acid patterns in the adult murine brain.

NP represents the latest in a long line of government endorsed attempts to introduce a more community orientated and customer focussed approach to policing. NP encourages police constables (PCs) and, the recently introduced, police community support officers (PCSOs) to spend more time engaging with the public, supporting vulnerable members of community and working in partnership with other agencies. This style of policing represents a significant departure from established understandings of policing which have become synonymous with ‗response policing‘ with its focus on maintaining public order and arresting criminals. A great deal of research over the last 30 years has referred to the highly gendered culture of policing which has also been the subject of a great deal of criticism.\r\nThis research focuses on the identity performances of NP officers and the different ways that NP is enacted within different contexts and situated interactions. My conceptual framework draws on both ethnomethodological and poststructural approaches in understanding how officers in different contexts constructed, reconstructed and resisted discourses in the performances of particular identities. This framework is therefore sensitive to how power and resistance works through discursive constructions within particular contexts. To further improve our appreciation of context, emphasis is given to the importance of cultural meanings as an important source of discursive constraint. However, the research clearly shows that while some discourses may be dominant in influencing identity performances, these are always contested and it is though the clash of competing discourses that the agency of NP officers is revealed (Holmer-Nadesan 1996). The study adopts an ethnographic methodology, using participant observation and semi-structured interviews to examine four broad NP contexts. These are the PCSO training course and the three neighbourhood teams, all of which are located in a different policing environment. Drawing on ethnomethodology, my approach focused on the front and back stage contexts of neighbourhood policing, examining the relationships between discourses and performances within these contexts.\r\nThe findings reveal the strength of dominant policing discourses linked to gender, police professionalism, ‗real‘ policing and community and also shows the ways that these discourses are also infused and subverted by different sets of meanings and ways of being. The PCs and PCSOs involved in the study were seen to manoeuvre and navigate these contested discourses in the ways they enacted NP in different contexts. The research also reveals the contested and fragmented nature of policing cultures and how these cultures may be best understood as a coexistence of multiple constructions of discourse (Mumby, 2011). The concluding discussion of the thesis presents a number of contributions in relation to the discursive construction of identities, the influence of gendered cultures as well as the challenge of introducing NP into British policing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bennett, Paul Anthony"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100349,"sim:weight":0.394451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.265519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.206843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.198592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.181927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.168668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Following its enforcement in 2015, changes are expected to the current water related regulations and water intensive industries, including steelworks, ought to prepare themselves for changes.\r\nIn 2007 Corus Group was taken over by Tata Steel, now one of the World’s top 10 steel producers with its production of 31 MTPA (million tonnes per annum of crude steel). Tata Steel Port Talbot Integrated Steelworks is one of Tata Steel’s main sites, currently producing some 4.33 MTPA (in 2007) of crude steel (slab) and is a major user of water with its 8 production facilities and supporting functions.\r\nFrom 2007 to 2011 the author worked as a core member of the World Steel Association Water Management Project. The project included development of a survey to gather water-related data from the World’s steelworks. 29 steelworks took part in the survey and using the data, an extensive assessment of water related performance in steelworks around the World has been carried out. The findings show that water performance related figures, including water use and effluent generation, vary from under 1 to near 150 m3/ts. The average consumption figure being 28.4 m3/ts with once-through cooling using an average 82% of this water. The average effluent discharge figure is 25.4 m3/ts. For Port Talbot Steelworks these figures are 33.8 m3/ts and 28.8 m3/ts respectively.\r\nAn investigation into effluent treatment technologies and efficiencies included carrying out chemical precipitation and co-precipitation titration experiments, especially looking at zinc, in order to better understand the behaviour of relevant metals during hydroxide precipitation reactions. The experimental results were compared against PHREEQCi theoretical geomodelling precipitation prediction data and PHREEQCi 2 indicated minimum zinc solubility is received at pH 9.5. Laboratory experiments support this. Iron enhances zinc precipitation strongly via co-precipitation. A similar effect, although to a lesser extent, is achieved for zinc co-precipitation with nickel and lead.\r\nThe author’s study of the Port Talbot water systems established that the chemical precipitation processes in operation leads to the generation of voluminious sludge that is hard to dewater further. This prompted the initiation of an investigation into the suitability of the High Density Sludge (HDS) process in treating high volume, non-acidic low metal concentration effluents, such as steelworks final effluent. Prior to this research the HDS process has been used mainly for the treatment of mine effluents and its suitability in treating non-acidic, low metal concentration effluent has not been fully explored. During the trial, a 10 L/h influent feed rate was aimed for with a half hour retention time at the first two reactors. The flocculant feed rate was around 2.5-3 mg/l of treated effluent throughout the trial. At the end of the trial the sludge concentrations exceeded 17% (w/w), while the treatment efficiencies of zinc and other metals stabilised and improved. Furthermore, the sludge was behaving as HDS sludge achieving high settling rates in excess of 22 m/h at 5% (w/v). Solids concentrations and sludge filterability had improved with the specific cake resistance reducing from the ‘single pass’ precipitation sludge near 35,000 Gm/kg to the 777 Gm/kg after 2 weeks of trial to a mere 169 Gm/kg at the end of the HDS trial.","bibo:AuthorList":["Suvio, Piia"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25847,"sim:weight":0.218973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.200006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25778,"sim:weight":0.174564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.16183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.16183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316479,"sim:weight":0.146343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In breast cancer cells, apoptotic resistance is an acquired feature that can promote tumour growth and progression. In order to assess the importance of apoptosis in these processes, caspases were directly inhibited by conditional expression of baculovirus p35 protein, a pan-caspase inhibitor, in the mammary glands of mice (rtTA/p35 mouse model). Inhibition of caspases during the first phase of involution in rtTA/p35 mice increased the number of sloughed luminal bodies which stained negatively for cleaved caspase-3. However, the total number of sloughed luminal bodies between mice with and without p35 expression was not changed. This suggests that caspase activation is not essential for the sloughing of mammary epithelial cells into lumen of alveoli and the initiation of involution may be a caspase-independent event. The importance of apoptotic resistance in breast cancer progression was also addressed by crossing rtTA/p35 mice with mice over-expressing the ErbB2 oncogene (Neu). Expression of p35 in established Neu mammary tumours did not affect the growth rates of tumours relative to un-induced controls. However, an increased number of mice with lung and liver metastases were observed when p35 was induced. This result substantiates the importance of apoptotic resistance in promoting metastasis and warrants the targeting of apoptosis regulators as an anti-metastatic therapy.\r\n          The NF-κB signalling pathway regulates a range of anti-apoptotic genes and can also induce the expression of a variety of metastatic promoting genes. Accordingly, the role and potential of the NF-κB p52 subunit as a therapeutic target was investigated. Firstly, this was addressed by silencing the Nfkb2 gene, which encodes p100/p52, in mammary cancer cell lines. Interestingly, assessment of these cells in in vitro assays measuring motility and tumour initiating potential revealed opposing effects in differing cell lines upon Nfkb2 knockdown. In N202.1A cells (ER-ve/ErbB2+ve), therapeutically beneficial effects were seen whereas in the 4T1 cell line (ER+ve/ErbB2-ve), malignancy was exacerbated. One explanation for the differential effects observed is that the negative regulatory subunit p100 and the transcriptional subunit p52 alternately have dominant roles in the respective cell lines. Although these results demonstrate a role for p52 in regulating tumour initiating potential in particular cell lines, the contextual outcomes indicate that targeting p52 at the gene level may be detrimental in cases where the loss of p100 outweighs the loss of p52. This indicates that strategies aimed at disrupting p52 activity should circumvent the loss of p100. Therefore, we addressed the possibility of diminishing p52 transcriptional activity via promotion of repressive transcriptional complexes. As the formation of repressive complexes is favoured by phosphorylation of Ser-222 in p52, we addressed the effects of over-expressing the S222D p52 mutant in 4T1 cells. In in vitro assays assessing proliferation, colony forming potential, tumour initiating potential and motility, we did not observe any differences upon expression of S222D p52. However, over-expression of S222A p52 did increase the motility of 4T1 cells and this demonstrates that the lack of Ser-222 phosphorylation (promoting transcriptionally active complexes) can contribute to the malignancy of breast cancer cells.\r\n          Due to the context dependent effects of Nfkb2 silencing, it was important to identify the particular subtypes of breast cancer which are dependent on p52 activity. We assessed a cohort of BRCA2-/- p53-/- tumours for nuclear p52 staining along with markers for respective breast cancer subtypes by immuno-histochemistry and found a positive correlation between p52 and p63. This suggests that aberrant p52 activity may be common in basal-like breast cancers which typically express p63 and could benefit most from p52 targeted therapies. In summary, our results indicate that targeting p52 in breast cancer cells can be therapeutically beneficial but only in particular subtypes of breast cancer and by certain therapeutic strategies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yeo, Syn Kok"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.209254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.170579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.162591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23816,"sim:weight":0.129821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.118449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.111276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Patterns of Welsh graduate mobility","bibo:abstract":"This paper presents the initial findings of a study into Welsh graduate mobility within the UK, which has a highly uneven geography of graduate labour.  After surveying recent debates, the paper explores the extent to which Wales retains its graduate labour by examining the scale of graduate mobility and its nature in terms of qualifications.  It does this by augmenting the data produced by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) with detailed analysis of Labour Force Survey (LFS) data to consider the location of successive ‘young’ graduate cohorts since the 1992 expansion of Higher Education.  The research finds that Wales is a net exporter of graduates and that those who migrate have higher educational attainment.

The paper highlights that inter-regional flows of graduates are sensitive to the path dependencies of mobile graduates themselves as well as the structures of regional economies.

The average age of first birth in the UK is now 29.5, an increase of six years over the past four decades. This may be problematic not only due to the fact that fertility declines with age (with a marked decrease after age 35) but also due to the fact that older age is associated with more complications during pregnancy and delivery to both mother and baby. Previous research has shown that although people have awareness of fertility risks and issues in general they often underestimate the risks and may not apply them to themselves. The aim of the present thesis is to examine reasons why people may be delaying childbearing, whether they know about the risks associated with reduced fertility and how we can better educate people about these risks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kalebic, Natasha Louise"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":22760,"sim:weight":0.362143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33661,"sim:weight":0.334156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108302,"sim:weight":0.272229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85097,"sim:weight":0.249976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.223266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99919,"sim:weight":0.220274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29925,"sim:weight":0.203538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23792,"sim:weight":0.186608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108418,"sim:weight":0.171565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84947,"sim:weight":0.144185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study investigated the physico-chemical characteristics and ecology of a nationally important concentration of temporary upland ponds in Radnorshire, Wales in both spatial and temporal dimensions (up to 80 ponds over 18 months).  Plant and macroinvertebrate communities were typical of oligotrophic, acidic ponds and appeared to vary along gradients of pH and hydroperiod, whilst including several nationally rare/threatened taxa.  A national classification based on the biological community of temporary ponds grouped Radnorshire ponds with a few others in western Britain.  Ponds were generally small, shallow and acidic with low concentrations of nutrients and dissolved minerals.  Water chemistry was associated with concentration by evaporation and dilution by rainwater, whilst the overall hydrology of ponds was successfully modelled using local meteorological data.  Over the course of the study, large increases in macroinvertebrate abundance were observed, but assemblage composition and richness were broadly constant.  Seasonality in the abundance of individual macroinvertebrate taxa was evident and suggested that autumn was the optimum time for invertebrate sampling in terms of abundance and diversity.  Nearly 40% of the variation among ponds in macroinvertebrate and plant communities was explained by a combination of a species-area effect and differences in pH: no effect of pond isolation was detected within the context of the study region.  A cumulative species-area analysis found that a group of small ponds support higher biodiversity than a single large pond of the same area, highlighting the importance of considering beta diversity. Taken together, the findings of this PhD project justify the designation of Radnorshire as an Important Area for Ponds: the ponds form a distinct ‘pondscape’ of \u003e80 waterbodies, with a highly dynamic environment and biota, and which provide a major habitat resource for rare species in the UK.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bransden, Anna Lucy"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The first set reflects various aspects of the traditional portrayal of justice, which depict tort as an independent ‘natural’ system of rules of universal application forming the foundation of a just society. The second group of images is more recent and relates to the development of a damaging compensation culture.  Focusing on personal injury litigation, we show, in different ways and to different degrees, how these portrayals differ from the reality of tort in practice.  In explaining how tort actually operates we reveal significant features of the culture of tort.  In practice it is heavily influenced by institutional arrangements: the importance of both welfare provision and liability insurance is highlighted, and the effects of a ‘no-win no-fee’ claims market are examined.  The article reveals that the operation of tort is very much affected by commercial interests and the economic demands of the institutions which surround it. Overall we conclude that the cultural images of tort examined fail to reflect how the system of compensation for personal injury actually operates in practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lewis, Richard Kurt","Morris, Annette"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100182,"sim:weight":0.32612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100158,"sim:weight":0.201358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.145387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.141737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.128308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.124497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26013,"sim:weight":0.121943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26012,"sim:weight":0.121943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Sovereign states that do not have an active enforcement stance against transnational bribery are facing intense criticism from ‘moral entrepreneurs’ such as international and intergovernmental anti-corruption bodies. However, the regulation of such crimes faces a key contradiction: as business transactions become more global, enforcement and regulation remain at the local and national level. In short, national authorities are pressured to respond to trans-national corporate bribery using inter-national frameworks for enforcement.\r\n\r\nThis thesis imports regulatory concepts to understand the variety of enforcement (e.g. criminal prosecution, civil sanctioning) and non-enforcement (e.g. self-regulation, accommodation) practices that help explain policy responses to transnational bribery. Comparing these responses in Germany and the UK is a useful empirical focus for examining the strengths and limitations of national enforcement approaches given both jurisdictions inhabit similar institutional contexts for corporate bribery e.g. relatively strong western European economies, fellow members of the EU/G8, subject to international conventions. The research incorporated a qualitative, comparative research strategy that involved semi-structured interviews, participant observation and bilingual document analysis.\r\n\r\nThe research found that despite significant differences (e.g. centralised or decentralised systems, existence of corporate criminal liability, legal cultures), both UK and German anti-corruption authorities (i) face similar difficulties in enforcement as they are limited by their national jurisdictional boundaries and face several procedural, evidential, legal, financial and structural obstacles but (ii) are converging towards similar prosecution policies (e.g. negotiation of civil settlements for corporations). However, in both cases, evidence suggests enforcement and emerging self-regulatory practices are limited in relation to the anti-corruption actors’ own estimation of the problem. Therefore, (iii) the default position of the response is an accommodation of corporate bribery, even where the will to enforce is high.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lord, Nicholas James"],"dc:date":"2012-05-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.226755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.201799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.159157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

On the one hand some academics have suggested that insurance has been no more than a ‘makeweight’ argument in the development of tort liability. On the other hand, others have claimed that insurance has had a substantial effect, even if this is often hidden or not discussed openly. This article lends support to one side of the debate by describing the enormous importance of insurers to personal injury litigation in the United Kingdom. It argues that all cases, in their wider context, have been affected by the practices of insurance companies. This is the case even though insurance is rarely mentioned by judges and largely ignored by textbooks on tort law. Insurers provide the lifeblood of the system.\r\n\r\nThe article examines statistics relating to the number of tort claims brought each year and it notes the extent of insurer involvement. As the paymasters of the system, insurers not only compensate claimants but also fund the cost of legal representation, often for both sides. Insurers have reduced their use of defence lawyers and the extent that they institute formal legal proceedings. However, it is their bureaucracy which determines whether, when and for how much claims are settled, and it is their offices, rather than courts of law, that are the key places for tort in practice. The scope for compensating those injured very much depends upon the incidence of insurance protection, and the amount of damages paid can only be understood against the insurance background. Finally, the article considers the influence of insurers upon potential changes in the law. The importance of insurers ought not to be underestimated: without insurance, the system of compensation for personal injury would have collapsed long ago.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lewis, Richard Kurt"],"dc:date":"2006","doi":"10.1057/palgrave.gpp.2510073","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100182,"sim:weight":0.45107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100158,"sim:weight":0.285845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26579,"sim:weight":0.238813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85570,"sim:weight":0.235279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84762,"sim:weight":0.229797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316357,"sim:weight":0.220068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85261,"sim:weight":0.216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108643,"sim:weight":0.214239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.200417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, earlier research suggested that during abrupt temperature fluctuations membranes represent the most thermally-sensitive macromolecular structures. The aim of this thesis to confirm experimentally for the membrane sensor theory in mammalian cells and to explore the mechanisms behind membrane lipid structural reorganizations. The main results are as follows:\r\n(i) I provide the first evidence that heat-analogous, chemically-induced membrane perturbation of K562 erythroleukemic cells is indeed capable of activating heat shock protein formation at the growth temperature, without causing measurable protein denaturation;\r\n(ii) I showed that the membrane fluidizer benzyl alcohol acts as a chaperone-inducer also in B16(F10) melanoma cells. Furthermore, following both alcohol and heat treatments, condensation of ordered plasma membrane domains was detected by fluorescence microscopy;\r\n(iii) lipidomic fingerprints revealed that stress achieved either by heat or benzyl alcohol resulted in pronounced and highly specific alterations of membrane lipids in B16(F10) cells. The loss in polyenes with the concomitant increase in saturated lipid species was shown to be a consequence of activation of phospholipases. The accumulation of lipid species with raft-forming properties may explain the condensation of ordered plasma membrane domains detected previously;\r\n(iv) with Laurdan two-photon microscopy it was demonstrated that, in contrast to the formation of ordered domains in surface membranes, the molecular disorder is significantly elevated within the internal membranes of cells preexposed to mild heat stress. These results were compared with those obtained by other probes and visualisation methods. It was found that the structurally different probes revealed substantially distinct alterations in membrane heterogeneity.\r\nThe results highlight that even subtle changes in membrane microstructure may play a role in temperature sensing and thermal cell killing and, therefore, could have potential in treatment of several diseases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Balogh, Gábor"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.185897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.162689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.15373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.152365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.137375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.135048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.13204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It pays particular attention to the way in which socialists related to Welsh national identity, and analyses the processes through which the universalist ideals of socialism were related to the particular and local conditions of Wales. It examines the interplay between Wales and the wider world that occurred through the medium of the socialist movement, and balances this against the internal dynamic and organic growth of socialism within Wales itself. Having surveyed and commented upon existing British and Welsh labour historiography, the thesis opens with a discussion of the first „modern‟ socialists to undertake propaganda in Wales in the 1880s. It then examines the way in which socialist societies began to put down roots in the 1890s, through case studies of the Fabian Society in Cardiff and the Social Democratic Federation in south Wales. The central part of the thesis is concerned with the rise of the most important of the socialist organisations, the Independent Labour Party. Attention is given to the way in which the ILP used the south Wales coal strike of 1898 to gain its ascendancy in Welsh socialist politics, and the nature of the political culture that was created by the party in south Wales. The remainder of the thesis discusses the nature of socialist growth beyond south Wales, and pays particular attention to indigenous Welsh forms of socialism. The thesis concludes with an examination of the rapid growth of the socialist movement in Wales after 1906, and the consequent debate that occurred about the relationship of socialism, Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wright, Martin"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60078,"sim:weight":0.394807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108398,"sim:weight":0.380664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1648476,"sim:weight":0.377216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.357706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316055,"sim:weight":0.313289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59086,"sim:weight":0.266583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109116,"sim:weight":0.25622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316073,"sim:weight":0.245136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60707,"sim:weight":0.237715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58478,"sim:weight":0.225701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.219109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.217682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108857,"sim:weight":0.217104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108256,"sim:weight":0.214389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.212948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52137,"sim:weight":0.211376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.192449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":315976,"sim:weight":0.170414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.151678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In post-Conquest\r\nEngland, where Geoffrey became a great landholder, he played a pivotal role in the\r\nconsolidation of the Conqueror’s victory.

Secondly, it investigatges empirically the relationship between the e3xchange rate and the term structure of interest rates, as proposed by Lim and Ogaki (eg Fama 1984: Lim and |Okaki 2004) using data from sixteen emerging economies during 1993-2001. Thirdly, it examines the impact of the term structure of the interest rates on bond risk in G7 countries and it tests the stability of this relation during pre- and post-financial crisis periods.  Fourthly, this disseration exploes the link between a director\u0027s pay and corporate performance using a panel data set of FTSE 350 companies during 2004-2009.\r\n\r\nThe empirical results deomonstrate a robust cointegrating forward-spot relationship and support the forward rate unbiasedness with high frequency data: however, the forward premium puzzle remains in most sample economies.  The term structure of interest rates plays an important role in exchange rate determination and the cointegrating relationship is stable despite the presence of a number of exchange rate regime changes for the emerging economies. In this study the short rate is considered as a proxy for economic uncertainty and the yield spread is considered as a proxy for business condition.  The findings show statistically significant effects of the short rate and yield spread on the bond risk for G7 economies, implying that interest rate policy may be important in reducing market volatility.

It describes Li’s early life, including his family background, his upbringing, his schooling and the environment he grew up in. It analyses some of Li’s early writings to demonstrate his philosophical predispositions and political orientation, as well as his character and temperament. It examines Li’s understanding of Marxism and his endeavours to disseminate it and to introduce various socialist theories into China. It describes his contacts with socialists of other countries and his cooperation with Korean socialists and Soviet agents in China, which helped open up the Communist movement in East Asia. The research focuses on Li Hanjun’s activities in establishing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the opinions he expressed at the Party’s founding congress. It also deals with his ideas and actions in directing labour movements in China. Li Hanjun was a dissident within the CCP and later left the Party. This study clarifies the divergence of views between him and other Party leaders, and shows that his rejection of the Bolshevik doctrines of centralism and dictatorship and of unconditional receipt of financial aid and orders from the Communist International (Comintern) were the main causes of the conflicts and his expulsion. The thesis discusses Li’s vision of socialism, and shows that his ideal socialist society was not one in which a centralist government and the dictatorship of a Communist élite should control and intervene in everything but a collectivity of associations of free and autonomous working people organised in cooperatives. The thesis ends with a critical assessment of Li as a historical figure. It recovers historical facts that have sunk into oblivion, and thus differs from comparable studies published both in China and abroad. It fills important gaps in the history of the early Communist movement in China.","bibo:AuthorList":["Li, Danyang"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58478,"sim:weight":0.384619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.312375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23497,"sim:weight":0.303855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.302455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931411,"sim:weight":0.293454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316055,"sim:weight":0.290957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.2745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.265933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60707,"sim:weight":0.240603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108256,"sim:weight":0.239394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109116,"sim:weight":0.234602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108496,"sim:weight":0.22476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108150,"sim:weight":0.22173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.21174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108765,"sim:weight":0.205112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Impact of children\u0027s participation on policy making","bibo:abstract":"This thesis examines the impact of children and young people’s participation on policy making in four settings, a youth forum and school council in Wales, UK and two examples of established participation structures in the international development context. The drive to include children as ‘policy actors’, as a legitimate group in the policy making process, has led in Wales, and in much of the UK, to the burgeoning of youth forums and school councils. But evidence of the impact of children’s public participation remains difficult to capture and little previous work has been done to evaluate the influence of children’s forums on the design, delivery and evaluation of public services.  \r\n\r\nThis thesis draws on theories of governance and power as well as the social construction of childhood to examine the policy influence that each of the forums had from the perspectives of the key stakeholders involved. The research makes a contribution to understanding the factors that enable or inhibit children’s ‘voice’ being turned into policy ‘influence’. Children’s forums are more likely to affect changes in public services where there is clarity about objectives; where efforts are focused on well-understood policy or practice opportunities; and where there is close integration between child participation structures and similar structures targeting other civil society groups at a local level. The importance of policy networks and the linking of the children’s resources with other influencing factors emphasises the important role of supporting adults in reflexively navigating the tensions in children’s public participation. \r\n\r\nThe thesis calls into question whether anyone is really listening to children’s views and opinions in the new governance spaces of a devolved Wales and argues that more needs to be done to insist on change and support children’s claims to express their views and to have those views taken into account, in line with Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.","bibo:AuthorList":["Crowley, Suzanne"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Indeed, arising from disenchantment with conventional industrial food production and supply chains, ‘alternative’ food networks aim to provide a means to reconnect consumers, producers and food (Kneafsey et al. 2008). By taking seriously the act of shopping for food as culturally meaningful and not merely a practice of routinely provisioning the home (Lunt and Livingstone 1992) this thesis then argues that ‘alternative’ food practice provides a platform for the performance of class identities. That is, both structurally and culturally, class is thought to matter to people (Sayer 2011), and is elucidated and reproduced through food practice. \r\n\r\nBy means of mixed methods data collection; participant observation, survey, semi-structured interviews and documentary analysis, this study provides support for a Bourdieusian approach to class analysis. In particular, the thesis makes use of Bourdieu’s toolkit of concepts by conceiving of class as a relative ‘position’. This is understood to be achieved via the moral derision of the ‘other’, where participants draw moral boundaries between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ foods and the ‘good’ or ‘bad’ who partake in its consumption. In this way, the field of ‘alternative’ food practice seems not only ground from which to observe class. Rather, ‘alternative’ food is understood to be appropriated as a resource of ‘distinction’ (Bourdieu 1984) that is then figured in the very maintenance and reproduction of class culture. \r\n\r\nThis interface between class, food and culture may prove consequential for those seeking substantive alternatives to conventional foodways. Crucially, it is argued that by imagining less socially and culturally uniform strategies to promote ‘alternative’ food practice, we may unlock their potential to provide an equitable and sustainable food future. To this end, by elucidating the moral significance of class in the field of ‘alternative’ food practice, this thesis has wider implications in carving a role for sociological enquiry in the emerging field of ‘sustainability science’ (Marsden 2011).","bibo:AuthorList":["Paddock, Jessica"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109110,"sim:weight":0.285348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58751,"sim:weight":0.215651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.20055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.199394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109179,"sim:weight":0.196759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.190732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.188449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.17341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.171624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.15942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.156801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86074,"sim:weight":0.141469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

That question was: “Should a law school try to teach students in a legal clinic where they are have to deal with problems faced by real clients?” The use of the word ‘clinic’ prompts the analogy of trainee doctors meeting real patients in their medical clinics. It is difficult to conceive of a doctor qualifying without ever examining a living body, or of scientists completing their education without setting up practical tests - but this has been the norm in university legal education outside of North America. Why should this be so?\r\n\r\nIn this article do two things: first, I reflect upon new factors - as well as the old considerations - which affect the answer to the question of whether clinical education should have a place in law school teaching; and secondly, I explain why that question is of growing importance not only in the UK but also in other countries.\r\n\r\nThe subject should be of particular interest in countries, such as Japan, where fundamental reconsideration is taking place of how lawyers are to be trained and for what purposes. Although clinical legal education is only one way in which theory and practice can be brought together, it encapsulates many of the issues in the reform debate. Views expressed on this subject may determine not only the future character of university legal education, but also the nature and scope of the legal profession itself. Clinical legal education thus constitutes a case study of many of the major issues in legal education.\r\n\r\nThe article was written for a conference in 1999 held in Tokyo Japan about legal education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lewis, Richard"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Utilising a mixed-methodology it investigates the interconnections between care, mobility, labour and control. \r\n\r\nThe care labour process is examined, particularly that of care homes for older people. It is seen that mobility controls shape the working and living conditions, employment relations and forms of exploitability experienced by differentially included migrants. As well as such dynamics the thesis also explores the strategies that emerge from within the workplace itself that migrants utilise in order to negotiate such conditions. \r\n\r\nCare is also examined from the vantage point of the lives of asylum applicants and their experiences of the asylum support regime that has emerged in recent years. Welfare and support services are argued to have increasingly come to be utilised as regulatory mechanisms.  The numerous ways this occurs and the effects this has on such migrants are examined as is the dual function that NGOs have come to play within such processes as both providers of support and sustainability and agents of control.\r\n\r\nA further aspect of care concerns the self-organised networks of care that migrants create amongst themselves. The concept of the ‘mobile commons’ is developed to argue that both the transnational and local networks of care that migrants craft, as well as the caring relations afforded through institutions such as churches are key in enabling migrants to become mobile, negotiate their caring commitments and sustain themselves while in transit or in a given location. \r\n\r\nBy thinking the relationship between care and migration from these interrelated perspectives the thesis aims to contribute to a reappraisal of existing forms of social movement organising and political mobilisation around the issue of mobility.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bishop, Hywel"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":57395,"sim:weight":0.3151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.240795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.222329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.219968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108065,"sim:weight":0.217306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316484,"sim:weight":0.214571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.20225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Over 600\r\npre-existing radiocarbon dates have been assessed as part of this analysis. Data\r\nhave been collected from 40 historic environment records as well as published\r\nsources. Those which are robustly associated with late mesolithic or early\r\nneolithic material culture have been incorporated in Bayesian chronological\r\nmodels.

In addition this thesis explores the\r\nchronological currency of different aspect of early neolithic material culture in\r\nregions across England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland.\r\nBy comparing estimates for the end of the mesolithic with estimates for the start\r\nof the neolithic, this thesis provides new evidence for processes which may have\r\nbeen at work during the mesolithic–neolithic transition. This thesis demonstrates\r\nthat aspects of late mesolithic cultural were present across England and Wales,\r\nmost probably in the 41st century cal BC when early neolithic material is first\r\npresent in south-east England. I demonstrate that mesolithic material culture\r\ncontinued to be used in England after this time, most probably for 100–300\r\nyears. The latest evidence for mesolithic material culture occurs at the time when\r\nthe neolithic appears across much of the country.\r\nThe earliest neolithic appears in many areas considered in this thesis in 3850–\r\n3750 cal BC.

In all, across\r\nEngland, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the appearance of early neolithic material\r\nculture took 200–400 years.

This dissertation sets out to assess the extent to which this resilience is associated with a civic and church structure that has maintained a high level of investment in the social components of religious expression and the more private devotional patterns of Anglican life. This dissertation is divided into three parts. Part 1 will look at the origins of the Anglican Church in Newfoundland and its contemporary place in society and will propose social capital theory as a theoretical explanation for the patterns of Anglican Church life in Newfoundland. The relevance of religious orientation theory will be considered as a counterbalance to ask if the social capital found among Anglican churchgoers in Newfoundland is at the expense of intrinsic religious motivation. Part 2 begins with a discussion of methodological considerations followed by a comparison of statistical trends since 1960 for the Anglican Church in Newfoundland, the Anglican Church in the rest of Canada, the Episcopal Church in the United States of America and the Church of England. A contemporary profile of the Diocese of Eastern Newfoundland and Labrador will then be considered followed by a qualitative study of the Diocese. Results from the US Congregational Life Survey administered in the Diocese will also be presented, enabling comparisons to be undertaken between the Anglican Church in Newfoundland and the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. Part 3 will reveal that in and around the Anglican Church in Newfoundland social capital remains high along with intrinsic religious motivation among churchgoers but it will be shown that the resilience of the Church is due to an unusually high degree of passive church membership in the wider society and the mutually beneficial way in which the Church and the community around it relate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Peddle, Geoffrey"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Profiled steel cladding was utilised as a solar\r\nabsorber, with the channels used to form a series of parallel ducts when covered by a\r\nglass surface. Air was considered to flow through the ducts in two modes; forced or\r\nbuoyant convection.\r\nThe factors affecting air flow were investigated in a laboratory experiment. The\r\nfactors affecting solar heat transfer to the air were investigated using prototypes in\r\nfield conditions. Three models for forced convection and two for buoyant were found\r\nin the literature. These were developed and compared against the experimental results\r\nto establish appropriate design models.\r\nThe design models were used to optimise the duct geometry for three desirable\r\noutputs; mass flow, temperature output or power output. Optimal duct geometry was\r\nfound to depend on the flow mode assumed. In addition, the optimal geometry also\r\ndepended on the required output. Thus it was determined that an optimal hybrid\r\nsystem which could switch modes as required, could not be configured; the function\r\nand utility of the system must be decided at the design stage and not reconfigured\r\nafterwards.\r\nThe annual performance of a building-scale south facing façade fitted with such a\r\nsystem (optimised for power output) was modelled for forced and buoyant convection\r\nmodes. It was found that both flow modes had the potential to generate significant\r\namounts of heat energy which could be used, for instance, to preheat ventilation air.\r\nThe buoyant system also showed the potential for the generation of significant natural\r\nventilation.

{"identifier":8817163,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The management of demographic change: a study of three German industrial sectors","bibo:abstract":"Repercussions of the demographic shift for firms include issues such an incremental rise in the average age of the workforce, unequal inflows and outflows of labour and managing organisational skill levels. In the case of Germany, organisational responses to demographic change are exacerbated by a predominant early exit culture, legislation which protects against the dismissal of older employees and related provisions set out in collective bargaining agreements. The aim of the research is to examine how demographic shifts impacted on German companies in the steel, chemicals and utilities sectors. After discussing these challenges, the thesis analyses measures implemented by these firms and explains differences in the responses between the sectors.\r\nThe empirical findings clearly indicate that far more was being done to prepare for, and to counter, the effects of demographic developments than the extant academic literature suggests. Companies which responded most proactively to demographic change issues perceived this to be part of their role as a responsible and caring employer.\r\nThe end to the financial support of early retirement by the German government was found to be an important catalyst for firms to develop measures to accommodate older workers, instead of offering them an early exit from the company. Nevertheless, a failure to respond effectively to the end of state-funded support for early retirement, as well as the tendency of some firms to ignore deep-seated motivational issues in older workers, suggests that companies have some way to go before they can be described as effectively tackling demographic change. Hence, this thesis is unable to prove conclusively that critics of the German management of demographic in organisations are wrong in pre-empting that German firms run the risk of falling into a demographic trap (Thun et al, 2007).\r\nThe thesis frames demographic change within a wider context of organisational shifts, by examining external and internal drivers of change. Variations in responses between sectors are explained by drawing attention to drivers of change within the three industrial sectors which have shaped the behaviour of firms, including past experiences of organisational restructuring.\r\nFinally, the thesis makes a number of important theoretical, empirical and practical contributions to the academic literature. The most important contribution is to provide qualitative, empirical data on how firms in Germany are dealing with demographic developments to address gaps in the literature on company responses to demographic change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Drew, Hilary"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.242029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108603,"sim:weight":0.24016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.231871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340561,"sim:weight":0.2232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.215411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the Shari\u0027ah reviews were found not to be effectively implemented by the\r\nShari\u0027ah boards thus raising concern regarding the quality of the Shari\u0027ah reports issued by\r\nthe boards highlighting both the importance and need for an external Shari\u0027ah audit. In\r\naddition, the composition of the Shari\u0027ah board members is revealed to have influence over\r\nthe quality of Shari\u0027ah decisions issued by the board. Moreover, the integrity of the Shari\u0027ah\r\nboard members, such as their ethical value, reputation and scholarly background, was found\r\nto be important in influencing its accountability and independence. Interestingly, Shari\u0027ah\r\nboards were also perceived by branch managers of not providing the required level of\r\ninvolvement. The study also emphasises that branch managers felt the Shari\u0027ah Advisory\r\nCouncil (SAC) to be the most important party within the Malaysian Shari\u0027ah governance\r\nframework, and that the dual-layer Shari\u0027ah governance system was viewed as having\r\ncontributed to the standardisation of Islamic banking. Also, it appears that the role played by\r\nthe Shari\u0027ah Advisory Council (SAC) is not limiting creativity in developing Islamic banking\r\nproducts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sheikh Hassan, Ahmad Fahmi"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Spraint surveys, used widely to monitor otter populations, describe distribution only. Discrimination between identity parameters through chemical analysis of scent marks has been conducted for many species but the feasibility of using this to enhance population monitoring has not been fully tested.\r\n\r\nScent presentation experiments were conducted on captive otters and provided some evidence that otters can determine the sex and reproductive status of the scent depositor. These experiments provide the first evidence of a potential role of both volatile and non-volatile compounds in otter communication, and revealed that otters learn where scent signals are likely to be presented.\r\n\r\nA series of experiments were conducted to optimise methods for the chemical analysis of otter scent. A combination of scent sample collection from otter carcasses and captive otters enabled the description of the chemical nature of otter scent. Scent was associated with age, sex and reproductive status, but not with diet. Scent was associated with individual identity and in females, progesterone concentrations, suggesting a role in reproductive behaviours.\r\n\r\nSpatial analysis at a national scale revealed differences in scent between genetically distinct subpopulations of otters. On a catchment scale there was no association between scent similarity and spatial proximity. Although scent differed significantly with individual identity, differences were not at sufficient resolution to allow discrimination between unknown samples collected in the wild. This thesis makes several major steps towards unravelling the complexity of otter scent communication and adds to the knowledge of otter biology and behaviour.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kean, Eleanor Freya"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Numerous studies have described associations between climatic change and breeding success, survival and the timing of migration among migrant birds, but we used an experimental approach to investigate the causal mechanisms underlying these widely-reported correlations. Specifically, we used food-supplementations to simulate experimentally the impact of changes in food availability across the annual cycle of a model species of long-distance migrant bird, the northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe). Food supplementation modified migratory schedules of wheatears by affecting migratory fuelling, but the strength of this impact varied between stages of the annual cycle and between two subspecies with contrasting migration strategies. Food supplementation advanced hatching date of wheatears in the UK, and led to some supplemented individuals increasing their reproductive output through multiple breeding attempts. Food-supplemented wheatears exhibited higher rates of annual survival than control wheatears, and the strength of this effect was most pronounced on survival of young immediately following fledging. These experiments highlight aspects of wheatear performance that are currently limited by food availability and are thus most sensitive to climate-driven changes in food supply (primarily migratory fuelling, number of breeding attempts and survival). We used experimental manipulations of temperature and soil moisture of upland grassland turfs to simulate the impact of climate change on the abundance and emergence phenology of the wheatear’s arthropod prey. Warming by 2 ºC and low soil moisture levels led to a reduction in arthropod abundance later in the season, indicating how such climate-driven changes would affect food availability to wheatears across the breeding season. These studies together provide experimental evidence for the mechanisms by which climate change is expected to influence population changes in migratory taxa.","bibo:AuthorList":["Seward, Adam Michael"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":51844,"sim:weight":0.274843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84355,"sim:weight":0.191727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108770,"sim:weight":0.18848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.145399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385587,"sim:weight":0.140169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, no study to date had examined the effect of omega-3\r\nPUFA and curcumin co-supplementation on behaviour or β-amyloid pathology in mouse\r\nmodels of AD. Further to this, no study to date had examined the effect of longitudinal\r\nomega-3 PUFA or curcumin supplementation provided from an early age before significant\r\npathological development in the Tg2576 model. This was deemed important since human\r\nstudies have suggested that lifelong dietary choices before disease development are an\r\nimportant factor in disease risk. Finally, although a plethora of studies has examined the\r\neffect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation, none has accurately examined its effect against an\r\nappropriate control diet. For example, some control diets contained differential levels of fatty\r\nacids such as excess total fat and omega-6 PUFAs. Such differences in the control diet may\r\nhave contributed to the observed beneficial effects of dietary omega-3 PUFA\r\nsupplementation, particularly since these dietary factors can exacerbate pathological\r\nprocesses related to AD.\r\nUsing this experimental design, chapter 3 found longitudinal dietary supplementation of\r\nomega-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from an early age in Tg2576 mice provided\r\nsome protection from cognitive decline that was limited to later but not early stages of\r\npathology. In contrast to previous reports however, Aβ pathology was unaltered by DHA\r\nsupplementation. Providing DHA supplementation from an even earlier age, chapter 4\r\nshowed that DHA reduced behavioural deficits at an early age (prior to Aβ pathology),\r\nalthough interestingly, these effects were less robust at the later age. Chapter 5 examined\r\nlongitudinal supplementation of curcumin, fish oil containing omega-3 PUFAs (DHA and\r\neicosapentaenoic acid, EPA) and their co-supplementation from an early age in Tg2576 mice.\r\nThe results consistently revealed no beneficial effects of dietary supplementation on\r\nbehaviour or Aβ pathological measures. The findings from this thesis indicate that dietary\r\nsupplementation of DHA relative to a suitable control diet can provide only limited\r\nprotection against behavioural deficits in Tg2576 mice. In contrast, fish oil supplementation\r\ncontaining omega-3 PUFAs DHA and EPA provided no protection, indicating that DHA\r\nmonotherapy may be a more advisable treatment. The null effects of curcumin\r\nsupplementation at earlier stages relative to previous studies suggest that curcumin may only\r\nbe effective during advanced stages of pathology, although further investigation is needed.\r\nFinally, the null effects of curcumin and fish oil/omega-3 PUFA co-supplementation suggest\r\nthat this is not an optimal intervention strategy in reducing Aβ-induced changes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hall, Katie May"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.32892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.269324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.167256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":275728,"sim:weight":0.166928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.164172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.158949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108641,"sim:weight":0.119281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795331,"sim:weight":0.115585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22742,"sim:weight":0.108631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recent research, however, reveals gaps in our understanding of the effects of oceanic variables such as temperature and carbonate saturation state on these trace metal ratios, which limits their application as proxies. Additional uncertainties arise because of physiological effects (“vital effects”) and microhabitat of the living foraminifera. Moreover, much of what is known about trace metal uptake into benthic foraminiferal calcite is derived from modern core-top calibrations and laboratory experiments and it is unknown as to what extent our understanding from these models can be applied to the early and mid Cenozoic.\r\nThis thesis attempts to address some of these questions using a novel depth transect approach and presenting benthic foraminiferal trace metal records across three major Cenozoic climate change events from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) deep sea core material. The events are: (i) The Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT), (ii) The Oligocene- Miocene boundary event (Mi-1) and (iii) The Middle Miocene Climatic Transition (MMCT). These records have allowed examination of the validity of the application of current knowledge of benthic foraminiferal trace metal proxies to Cenozoic records, and also the comparison of the records of two different benthic foraminiferal species, which has shed new light on the importance of foraminiferal habitat in the interpretation of the proxy data.\r\nThe identification of a dissolution effect operating on benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca in undersaturated waters has allowed a reasonable estimate of cooling (~2-3˚C) to be obtained from deep-sea records across the Eocene-Oligocene Transition. The transient glaciation at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary is estimated to comprise of a deep-sea cooling of ~2°C and a sea level decrease of ~80 metres based on Oridorsalis umbonatus Mg/Ca. Comparison of new Middle Miocene trace metal records across a water depth transect has shed light on the relative interplay of temperature and saturation state on published Mg/Ca records, enabling more accurate estimates of temperature and ice volume change. The new interpretations suggest that deep sea temperatures cooled by ~4.5C, and sea level fell by 70-100 metres between 16.2 and 11.6 Ma.\r\nThe recently developed paired Mg/Ca-Li/Ca approach to calculating simultaneous variations in bottom water temperature and saturation state has been used to assess inter-basinal differences in water mass composition for the first time. Down-core benthic foraminiferal Li/Ca records from Ceara Rise Sites do not behave as expected, indicating that there may be times when this proxy is affected by an additional environmental parameter. This is tentatively suggested to be a growth-rate related oxygenation signal. U/Ca in benthic foraminifera does not appear to work as a saturation state proxy in these records, again indicating either different behaviour to the observed modern behaviour, or additional factors absent from the modern calibration, such as bottom water oxygenation. Benthic foraminiferal Sr/Ca follows the linear negative water-depth relationship of Lear et al., (2003) suggesting a pressure-related effect.\r\nThis study demonstrates that benthic foraminiferal trace metal chemistry can be used to provide information about climate events in the Cenozoic, however additional empirical work is required to fully understand the systematics of trace metal incorporation into benthic foraminiferal tests.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mawbey, Elaine M."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The three treatment methods comprised alkaline sulphite solution (0.1 M NaOH/0.05 M Na2SO3) at room temperature and at 60°C and sodium hydroxide solution (0.1 M) deoxygenated using a\r\nnitrogen gas positive pressure system at room temperature.

A wide range of extraction patterns emerged, with the majority of individual treatments extracting 60–99% of the chloride present. Residual chloride levels for 87% of the objects fell below 1000 ppm and 42% were below 200 ppm. Although no treatment extracted 100% of the chloride in the object, alkaline desalination produced very significant reductions in chloride content.

Three trenches were opened just next to the so-called Andreion or Almond Tree House on the NW slopes of the First Acropolis, excavated by R.C. Bosanquet in 1901. The upper layers of two of these trenches (A-200 and A-300) comprised re-deposited material of Classical and Hellenistic date, which we infer came from Bosanquet’s dump. Material from these upper layers comprised tile, pottery (including numerous examples of Cretan necked cups), loomweights and terracotta plaques with a distinct masculine iconography. Excavation also reached lower Late/Classical-Hellenistic floor levels, on which a number of pithoi survived in situ. Some of these pithoi are considerably older than the floor level, a terminus post quem for which is provided by a bronze coin. The abandonment of these houses must be dated to the final phases of Praisos’s occupation, before 146 BC. There is however nothing to suggest that the city itself was subject to a fire destruction.

Emphasis on ‘the victim’s story’ can mean that personal accounts may allow a risk to enter the media in spite of official denials; and the absence of existing ‘victims’ may make a story less newsworthy;\r\n\tLocation – a geographically bounded event will provide a more media friendly crisis than one without a ‘news centre’. Geographical or social distance between journalists and their assumed audience also impacts on coverage; \r\n\tVisuals – the media, especially television, are attracted by the ‘spectacular spectacle’.  Such visuals also often have a very powerful impact on audiences;  Evidence of ‘harm’ is usually more newsworthy than evidence of ‘benefits’ or lack of harm.  Exceptions to this are when reports of ‘safety’ or ‘lack of danger’ go against received wisdom or when there are other reasons for a particular media outlet to oppose central government declarations of danger; \r\n\tThe importance of events – news reporting tends to be ‘event’ orientated rather than issue orientated. This means, for example, that a ‘leak’ or ‘spill’ will make a story but background pollution/radiation does not;\r\n\tOfficial procedures – in the absence of a ‘disaster event’, the news media will often examine a ‘risk’ through official procedures such as permit application, regulatory decisions or an inquiry; \r\n\tThe impact of conflict, ‘cover-ups’ and blame – in the absence of a clear disaster prompting risk coverage, then conflict and blame are often key criteria in media attention to risk; \t\r\n\tThe spiral of concern – the media can create a self-perpetuating spiral of concern, with risk stories growing once they enter diverse parts of the news (e.g. a science story becoming a political story).  One part of the media can help to keep the story on the agenda of other parts of the media. Policy and audience responses to the agenda set by the media can also help keep an issue in the headlines.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kitzinger, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These reactions were carried out in both low pressure glass reactors and high pressure autoclaves. The reaction conditions such as temperature and amount of base were investigated to order to achieve the optimum conditions. The gold based catalysts used were prepared by sol immobilisation and impregnation methods. The supports tested were activated carbon, titania, ceria and magnesium oxide. The ceria supported catalyst was demonstrated to be extremely selective for the oxidation of 1,2-propanediol in methanol in which methyl lactate is the desired product. The addition of palladium to the gold catalyst led to an increase in activity for all supports, however, in the case of the ceria supported catalyst a decrease in selectivity was observed.\r\nThe use of a magnesium oxide support was found to be advantageous in the oxidation of 1,3-propanediol and model compounds 1,4-propanediol and butyrolactone. An increase in activity and selectivity to the desired products, dimethyl malonate and dimethyl succinate, was demonstrated when this catalyst support was used. The structure of the support was found to be Mg(OH)2 when the catalyst was prepared by sol immobilisation. When prepared by impregnation methods the support retained its periclase MgO structure but was found to be far less selective than the Mg(OH)2 support.The use of this support for the oxidation of glycerol was investigated.

In this context, the communication of institutions struggling to retain trust among consumers, investors and government is paramount to their survival. The public relations function, as the driver of communication activity, has been recognised as ‘trust manager’ as well as a process that deploys discourses for organisational and societal purposes. This theoretical paper examines trust production in financial services as it relates to discourse, power and resistance. It hypothesises five trust practices – the act of protecting, the act of guaranteeing, the act of opening up or making transparent, the act of aligning with other trust systems and finally the act of simplifying; this latter being most closely associated with public relations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bourne, Clea Dianne"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85248,"sim:weight":0.191398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.164234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In many ways, the financial crisis was the first to result\r\nfrom a breakdown of assurance mechanisms, or generators of trust (Yandle, 2008). In other\r\nwords, this particular global crisis was, at its core, a crisis of trust. What is also unique, though\r\nless adequately discussed, is that the global financial crisis was initially triggered not by a loss of\r\npublic trust, but by an internal loss of trust between actors within the financial system itself. I\r\nrefer specifically to the breakdown of trust between visible financial system and the ‘shadow’\r\nfinancial system, the latter representing a sizeable portion of the system that is largely invisible\r\nto the public eye. For the purpose of this paper, I define organisations as “sites where members\r\nsubject themselves and one another to various practices, where discourse sustains mutually\r\nreinforcing patterns of power and powerlessness” (Conrad and Haynes, 2001; 65). Power resides\r\nin these discursive practices, including the organisational knowledge formation and claims about\r\nit. In his discussion of trust in trans-organisational relations, Bachmann (2001), looks at the\r\ncomplex social processes involved in inter-firm relationships, and finds that firms operating\r\nwithin national boundaries have a shared world of institutional arrangements which govern the\r\nforms of trust relevant when engaging in specific relationships with each other.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bourne, Clea"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108901,"sim:weight":0.228236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71910,"sim:weight":0.214574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.209466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.182529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Over and over, the hopes of everyday consumers have been dashed as unregulated schemes have gone bust. The pursuit of ‘too-good-to-be-true’ investment return is a part of the financialisation of the human experience; highlighting the increasingly central role investment plays as a ‘technology of the self’ (French and Kneale, 2009). \r\n\r\nA remarkable discursive struggle involving such investment schemes occurred in the small Caribbean state of Jamaica in the years leading up to the global financial crisis. Between 2006 and 2008, unregulated investment clubs operating as currency traders came to dominate Jamaican financial narratives. The rise of these unregulated investment schemes is indicative of the increasing availability and accessibility of alternative investment opportunities in financial markets (Demir, 2009).\r\n\r\nWhat was particularly interesting about these Jamaican investment schemes is that their rapid growth was accompanied by the entangling of financial narratives with cultural narratives. In a society heavily stratified by social class and dominated by the influence of the Christian church, Jamaicans from all walks of life not only accepted financial risk into their homes (Martin, 2002), but into their churches too. The success of these unregulated Jamaican investment clubs became discursively linked with the country’s religious beliefs and long-standing class struggle.  \r\n\r\nThis short paper will provide some preliminary insights into the interplay of financial and cultural narratives in trust production in a small state at the global periphery. I will argue that financial institutions produce trust through a series of deliberate practices including alignment with formal trust bodies. Yet, in the case of the Jamaican market, investment clubs rejected the mantle of trust offered by the financial regulator, choosing instead to align with an even more trusted body, the Church, specifically the fast-growing charismatic church. Investment clubs offered such tantalising return that they were eventually able to produce mistrust in the regulator itself. \r\n\r\nThrough the case study, I will offer insights on how trust and mistrust discourses proliferate as flows of power and resistance in financialised systems. The case study will underscore the growing salience of the subject position of the investor (French and Kneale, 2009). It will also highlight the unique twists to global financial discourses as they encounter local contextualities; and as financial subjectivities overlap with other biopolitical domains (French and Kneale, 2009). The paper will further contribute to the under-researched area of financialisation in small states, providing a voice to those on the margins.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bourne, Clea"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":8817899,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Supporting integrated care pathways with workflow technology","bibo:abstract":"Modern healthcare has moved to a focus on providing patient centric care rather than disease centred care. This new approach is provided by a unique care team which is formed to treat a patient. At the start of the treatment, the care team decide on the treatment pathway for the patient. This is a series of treatment stages where at the end of each stage, the care team use the patient’s current condition to decide whether the treatment moves to the next stage, continues in the treatment stage, or moves to an unanticipated stage. The initial treatment pathway for each patient is based on the clinical guidelines in an Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) [1] modified to suit the patient state.  This research mapped a patient ICP decided by the healthcare providers into a Workflow Management System (WFMS) [2]. The clinical guidelines reflect the patient-centric flow to create an IT system supporting the care team. In the initial stage of the research the IT development team at Velindre Hospital identified that team communication and care coordination were obstacles hindering the implementation of a patient-centric delivery model. This was investigated to determine the causes, which were identified as difficulty in accessing the medical information held in dispersed legacy systems. Moreover, a major constraint in the domain is the need to keep legacy systems in operation and so there is a need to investigate approaches to enhance their functionalities. These information systems cannot be changed across all healthcare organisations and their complete autonomy needs to be retained as they are in constant use at the sites. Using workflow technology, an independent application representing an ICP was implemented. This was used to construct an independent layer in the software architecture to interact with legacy Clinical Information Systems (CISs) and so evolve their offered functionalities to support the teams. This was used to build a Virtual Organisation (VO) [3, 4] around a patient which facilitates patient-centric care. Moreover, the VO virtually integrates the data from legacy systems and ensures its availability (as needed) at the different treatment stages along the care pathway.  Implications of the proposal include: formalising the treatment process, filtering and gathering the patient’s information, ensuring care continuity, and pro-acting to change. Evaluation of the proposal involved three stages; First, usefulness evaluation by the healthcare providers representing the users; Second, setup evaluation by developers of CISs; and Finally, technical evaluation by the community of the technology. The evaluation proved; the healthcare providers’ need for an adaptive and a proactive system, the possibility of adopting the proposed system, and the novelty and innovation of the proposed approach. The research proposes a patient-centric system achieved by creating a version of an ICP in the system for each patient. It also provides focussed support for team communication and care coordination, by identifying the treatment stages and providing the care team requirements at each stage. It utilises the data within the legacy system to be proactive. Moreover, it makes these required data for the actions available from the running legacy system which is required for patient-centred care. In the future the worth could be extended by mapping other ICPs into the system. This work has been published in four full papers. It found acceptance in the health informatics community [5, 6, 7] as well as the BPM community [8, 9]. It is also the winner of the 2011 “Global Award of Excellence in Adaptive Case Management (ACM)” in “Medical and Healthcare” [10] of the Workflow Management Coalition (WFMC) [11].","bibo:AuthorList":["Alsalamah, Hessah"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There is a great interest in making these networks more flexible, so they can be more easily deployed to meet the needs of new tasks. The research problem is lack of reactiveness of a system utilising a sensor network in a dynamic real-time domain, where the state of sensors and tasks might change many times (e.g. due to a sensor malfunction, or a change in task requirements or priorities). In such domains (e.g. firefighting or the military) we want to minimise the time spent manually configuring the sensor network, as any delay dramatically endangers the outcome of a task or a delay’s effects might be unacceptable, e.g. the loss of a human life. The current way of deploying sensors in the problem context involves four consecutive steps: Direction, Collection, Processing and Dissemination (DCPD). These steps form a cycle, called the DCPD loop. Automating this loop as much as possible would be a big step towards solving the reactiveness problem. Service-Oriented Sensor Networks (SOSN), allow sensors to be discovered, accessed, and combined with other information-processing services, thus enabling an efficient sensor exploitation. They are only a partial solution to the problem, as they don’t employ explicit representations of a user’s information-requiring tasks. Therefore, a machine processable expression of a user’s task (task representation, TR), allowing automation of the DCPD steps, is needed. We showed that, currently, there is no TR that can completely automate the loop, but that we can create such a hybrid of current TRs (called HTR) that automates the loop more than the individual TRs. Our literature review revealed four TRs. Using the identified TRs, we formed three high level designs of task representations. None of them covered the loop completely thus by enrichment of one of the built HTRs with the missing concepts, we finally obtained one that covers the DCPD loop fully. We tested the four hybrids in a simulation run for four scenarios with distinctive likelihoods of change of task and platform states. It showed that significant benefits are gained just by reusing existing technologies and that the reactiveness problem can be effectively tackled by that approach, particularly visible in the emergency response scenario, characterised by low task and high platform changeability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Borowiecki, Konrad"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26670,"sim:weight":0.322048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.266759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.265069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70404,"sim:weight":0.250315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.240094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.21663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70126,"sim:weight":0.184702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70175,"sim:weight":0.151477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Motorways and service areas are sites where clear boundaries have been asserted, materially as well as theoretically, between local and national, traditional and modern, country and city, place and ‘non-place’. Through close readings of service area forms, details and materials in context, this thesis shows how such absolute distinctions cannot be maintained. Rather than instances of ‘non-place’ – Marc Augé’s term for spaces lacking social relations, history or identity – service areas show place as process: as never absolutely fixed and always dependent on interrelated material, socio-cultural and historical contexts. This is not to dissolve the differences between places, but to show how they are contested and the power relations involved. The thesis thus explores a notion of place informed by what Jacques Derrida calls ‘iterability’, a logic of irreducible contamination, of repetition with difference. \r\n\r\nChapter 1 considers two typical recent service areas, Hopwood Park and Donington Park. It shows how boundaries of place are dissimulated and yet tightly policed, how allusions to ‘public’ space also recall the ‘private’ space of the home, and how an illusion of unlimited hospitality conceals the power of the host. By comparison, ‘independent’ operator Westmorland, the focus of Chapter 2, appears to be an exception. On one level, the company’s Tebay Services reclaim the roadside for the locality; on another, however, the sites, and the region they represent, become caught up in the cultures, forces and economies they claim to resist. Westmorland the company is conflated with Westmorland the place. As this ‘natural’ host offers an idyllic Lakeland refigured for the outsider’s consumption, it contests how and by whom that place is to be consumed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Austin, Samuel"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Government reform agendas in the UK try to thrive on public support for \u0027empowerment of local communities\u0027, more \u0027voice and choice\u0027 for service users, and a discourse of \u0027partnership\u0027 with the VS for implementing policies that imply an increasingly competitive commissioning of sensitive services.\r\n\r\nThis research traces the neocommunitarian turn in neoliberal discourse and develops a critique of the imposed pseudo-marketisation of social care by examining everyday experiences of labour. The study is based on ethnographic fieldwork in London\u0027s VS. In relation to reports in the sector on the loss of funding for women-only projects and services, it examines the transformation of working conditions and the strategies applied in dealing with the outcomes of reform.\r\n\r\nThe study draws on in-depth interviews with 31 women working for 19 different women\u0027s organisations. Additional interviews were conducted with union representatives and officers working for local infrastructure organisations and commissioning bodies in two inner London boroughs, in which the outcomes of commissioning practices for the workforce in the VS were further explored.\r\n\r\nIt is argued that neocommunitarian neoliberalism results in insecure work environments and the institutionalisation of volunteering, which will exacerbate the ongoing crisis of care. While employment in the women\u0027s sector has always been precarious – as being short-term, insecure, poorly remunerated and supported by high amounts of volunteering – women reported on a loss of control over the quality and direction of work as well as the imposition of inadequate workloads. This makes it increasingly difficult to endure and resist precarity in social care. It creates harmful work environments and implies a loss of needs-adequate service provision, both traced to intensify existing inequalities along the lines of class, gender and race.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ehrenstein, Amanda"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This project conducted a comprehensive study of methanogens in a range of marine sediments including tidal-flats, a shallow bay, deep-water mud volcanoes and Guaymas Basin hydrothermal sediments. Nine of the sixteen recognised methanogen genera were cultured ranging from only one methanogen genus at mud volcano sites to eight in tidal-flats. At a number of these sites, culture-independent techniques (16S rRNA and mcrA gene sequences) had either failed to detect the presence of methanogens or had under-estimated the methanogen diversity.\r\nAcetate and hydrogen utilizing methanogens (including two strains of the genus Methanococcus) were cultured from marine sediments with high sulphate content. But by far the most abundant genus was Methanococcoides being isolated from seven of the sites investigated, including the deepest (in terms of water depth) non-thermophilic methanogens so far isolated. Study of the isolated Methanococcoides strains has extended the substrate range of the genus by identifying of two new directly utilized methylated substrates (betaine and choline). The substrate range of this genus has been further extended by demonstrating dimethylsulphide utilization, a compound only previously known as a growth substrate in closely related genera.\r\nIn addition to substrate tests, representative strains from each of the sites investigated were physiology characterized including temperature, pH and Na+ concentration ranges. Members of the genus Methanococcoides are mesophilic/ psychrotolerant, neutrophilic and halotolerant. Their substrates are limited to methylated compounds. For the first time strains of mesophilic methanogens (Methanococcoides) were tested for their ability to grow under elevated hydrostatic pressure, up to 70 MPa.\r\nIn conclusion, methylotrophic methanogens play an important role in marine sediment methanogenesis with the methylotrophic genus Methanococcoides being widespread. The range of methylotrophic substrates is wider than previously described and further work is required to determine the full extant of methylated compounds as substrates for methanogenesis. Molecular based studies often fail to identify the presence of methanogens that are subsequently detected in culture-based studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Watkins, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.175989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108388,"sim:weight":0.17063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29438,"sim:weight":0.152053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108048,"sim:weight":0.15192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31148,"sim:weight":0.138561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.137928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26380,"sim:weight":0.136905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269539,"sim:weight":0.132369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55755,"sim:weight":0.10652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The analysis addresses an often implied but conceptually and empirically neglected feature\r\nin the otherwise booming social sciences literature on financial markets and the global financial crisis: how political struggles shape economic space. It does this against the background of the construction of the UK mortgage market which, as opposed to its American counterpart, is still underresearched.\r\nThe thesis addresses these shortcomings by engaging the theory of Ernesto Laclau and the associated logics approach of the Essex School of Political Discourse Theory. It provides a detailed genealogical analysis of the\r\ntransformations in the mortgage market during the three decades leading up to the financial crisis emphasising the significance of hegemonic struggles and ideology in its constitution.\r\nEmpirically, the thesis investigates the transformation of the mortgage market from a ‘sheltered circuit’ dominated by a building society price cartel in the 1970s to a sphere that is increasingly driven by global financial markets.\r\nIt is argued that at the heart of these transformations was the neo-liberalist deregulation in the name of the signifier ‘freedom’ which, in the neoliberalist age, became almost exclusively equated with ‘free markets’. The demutualisations of the 1990s are presented as an outcome of\r\nneoliberalist deregulation leading to a fundamental shift of power in the market. In return for improved access to capital markets and powered by ideological discourses, the demutualisation of 10 societies resulted in a massive transfer of mortgage assets to the stock market and contributed significantly to the financialization of mortgages. The struggles and resistance surrounding these events illustrate their contingent nature. However, the proposed re-mutualisation of Northern Rock had been squandered amidst a re-affirmation of neoliberalist ideology centring on the market as the best\r\nprovider of mortgages.","bibo:AuthorList":["Klimecki, Robin Patrik"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.30982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.252571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.244667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.224449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.17853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The research was into the contribution of prison chaplaincy in England and Wales to the contemporary prison service; to the lives of prisoners and the life of the prison. The research was carried out during the calendar year 2010, in seven sites in England and Wales and involved interviews with chaplains, prisoners, prison officers, governors and senior managers. \r\nThe report identifies the primary role of the chaplain as being pastoral, and an important secondary role, of providing specifically religious support, facilitating prisoners’ religious observance through the provision of opportunities for prayer, worship and religious education and counsel.\r\nThe report considers perceptions of change in the role of chaplains, including in relation to status and multi-faith practice.  The report identifies the value of prison chaplaincy as lying particularly in the distinctiveness of the chaplain’s role, especially in relation to the different role of the prison officer. Chaplains are identified as those with time for prisoners, who make availability a priority. This contributes to a sense, particularly from prison officers and governors, that chaplains have something of a ‘neutral’, or ‘independent’, status within prison.\r\nThe report concludes with recommendations about how the distinctiveness of chaplaincy could be supported and enhanced, not least through co-ordination, further training, and transparency about the particular contribution chaplains make to prisons and prisoners; and the way they offer a complementary role to that played by other staff.","bibo:AuthorList":["Todd, Andrew","Tipton, Lee"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Chapter 2 locates this in the field of practical theology, demonstrating only a rather tenuous link between practical theological reflection on biblical interpretation and the practice of churches.  This clarifies the aim of the thesis: to investigate the practice of Bible-study groups, as a contribution to the practical theology of biblical interpretation.\r\n\r\nChapters 3 and 4 consider the methodology of the investigation (including in operation), bringing together interests from ethnography and discourse analysis, in relation to a wider frame of action research.   Chapters 5 to 7 of the thesis account for the field work of the research, carried out through meetings with the three Bible-study groups, recording of data, transcription, coding and further analysis.  Analytical concerns include the speech-exchange patterns of group meetings and the linguistic resources employed, in order to investigate how interpretative activity is achieved in the interaction between group participants.  A particular interest is in the way different voices interrupt each other, and re-contextualise the conversation; but also contribute to dialogue, especially between authoritative interpretations and critical questions from participants’ experience.  Comparisons are drawn with discourse in medical contexts and of scientists.\r\n\r\nChapters 8 and 9 offer a comparative study of the three groups: of group dynamics; and of the dynamics of interpretative dialogue.  They also provide a rich picture of the practice of Bible-study, which includes sensual, ritual, relational and theological dimensions, key to which is the critical recruitment of texts and other voices, in order to interpret the relationship between God, group participants and others.  God is experienced as incarnate in this interaction; but also transcends the dialogue.  Chapter 10 concludes the thesis, identifying questions for further research and offering suggestions designed to enhance Bible-study practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Todd, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

They also have a variety of communication styles where communication aids, picture boards or symbols as well as gestures and sign language are used. The aim of the study was to measure the effect of ADC on lower limb muscle strength and length and explore their cycling experiences. \r\nMethods\r\nInterviews were conducted with children and an accompanying adult to tell us about their experiences before and after six session of ADC. They also kept a diary about this experience. The researchers developed the interviews as they encountered different styles of communication. The use of pictures to encourage a dialogue about cycling was helpful. Closed questions were used with images of happy or sad faces to capture more feeling about the experiences when spoken language was not possible. Observation of their non verbal communication was essential. The data transcripts were verified by the accompanying adult and analysed using a template approach. The themes were sent back to the participants for comments.\r\nResults\r\nTwenty six interviews and eight diaries were collected from seventeen children and young people aged between 2 and 17 years. The emergent themes are the firstly the impact on the child and family providing them with an opportunity to join in a recreational activity together. Secondly, their future cycling aspirations such as owning their own bike or going on a cycling holiday.

He finds that by far the most important deciding factor in choosing Wales as an investment location is the availability of the government grants and subsidies that facilitate the initial location process. If this assistance were not available then the majority of FDI projects would not be attracted to Wales. The perception during the location decisionmaking process by potential FDI plants of the availability and quality of skilled labour in Wales is good compared with that of other potential regions. However, upon locating it appears that there is a significant shortfall between this perception and the actual quality of skilled labour available. Although the large majority of FDI plants utilise \u0027aftercare\u0027 training and skills-development initiatives facilitated by regional institutions and agencies the programmes in place in Wales are not always of the standard required by inward investors. The author finds that training budgets are significantly higher among FDI companies in Wales than comparably sized businesses in the United Kingdom as a whole, indicating that their contribution to regional workforce development has been underemphasised. It is concluded that, despite some recent restructuring, inward investors in Wales have attempted to act as \u0027local\u0027 agents, exerting an influence on and having an interest in the socioeconomics of their residing localities, suggesting an increasing degree of embeddedness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Huggins, Robert"],"dc:date":"2001","doi":"10.1068/c0066","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45495,"sim:weight":0.44479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108919,"sim:weight":0.427554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930801,"sim:weight":0.416241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85669,"sim:weight":0.303848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108911,"sim:weight":0.299493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108806,"sim:weight":0.218611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108211,"sim:weight":0.209134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108829,"sim:weight":0.187584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108754,"sim:weight":0.165054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although there have been numerous studies assessing the economic and innovation impact of HEIs, there has been little systematic analysis of differences in the relative contribution of HEIs across regions. With this paper we provide an exploration of some of these differences in the context of the UK’s regions. Significant differences are found in the wealth generated by universities according to regional location and type of institution. Universities in more competitive regions are generally more productive than those located in less competitive regions. Also, traditional universities are generally more productive than their newer counterparts, with university productivity positively related to knowledge commercialisation capabilities. Weaker regions tend to be more dependent on their universities for income and innovation, but often these universities underperform in comparison with counterpart institutions in more competitive regions.

Since its arrival in 1997 the Labour government in the UK has taken steps to tackle barriers to entrepreneurship by addressing economic, political, legal, and cultural issues. Through a review of key literature and policy documents, we seek to shed light on how the Labour government has shaped its entrepreneurship and enterprise-development policy agenda. It is found that, although there has been limited improvement in closing the enterprise gap, the Labour government does appear to have put in place a number of measures that are aimed at harnessing the long-term drivers of future enterprise, particularly catalysing the required cultural changes through the education system. It is suggested that enterprise policy making is diverse and has shifted away from small-business policy into a broader interpretation of entrepreneurship, although there inevitably continues to be significant overlap across the two areas. Furthermore, it is argued that enterprise initiatives are leading to the government taking quite radical routes in shaping its policies, becoming a bigger risk taker, and operating in a quasiprivate sector role. It is concluded that the increasing sophistication and specificity of policy instruments means that further research is required to understand how policies interact with each other.","bibo:AuthorList":["Huggins, Robert","Williams,  N."],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1068/c0762b","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Australian lessons for intergovernmental fiscal relations in the United Kingdom","bibo:abstract":"Current arguments in Australia concerning horizontal fiscal equalisation may help inform the debate in the United Kingdom concerning possible changes to the Barnett formula and the establishment of financial relations with any regional governments in England. Although Australia is a long-established federation, with mature institutions for managing the financial aspects of intergovernmentaltlsb\u003e relations, the most populous states are now pushing for a per-capita-based system to replace the existing formula -- based on needs and costs -- overseen by the independent Commonwealth Grants Commission. This has important implications for the United Kingdom, where the Barnett formula -- a per capita system for deciding annual changes in the funding for the devolved administrations -- has been increasingly challenged. In particular, the Barnett system has been vulnerable to nontransparent \u0027formula-bypass\u0027 agreements. We argue that the status quo in the United Kingdom appears secure as long as England remains a single entity and the UK Treasury sees the financial implications of larger per capita expenditure in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland as relatively small. However, we speculate that regionalisation of government in England would be likely to increase the pressure: to abandon the Barnett system; to look more systematically at need and cost, rather than population, as criteria for allocating funds between governments; and to move towards an Australian-type system. However, the recent experience of Australia also shows that larger states prefer a per-capita-based system allied to more political, less transparent, arrangements to deal with \u0027special circumstances\u0027.

However, agro-industrial and postproductivist logics and dynamics have largely tended to marginalise its significance. In this paper we explore some of the conceptual parameters needed to develop the rural development dynamic. This is one which recentralises agriculture and farm-based activities and provides a basis for countering the growing crisis in rural and agricultural policymaking. In order to further embed the rural development dynamic, however, new alliances need to be attached to the struggles that are currently underway in rural areas.

In this model, the ssumption that a lagged indexation scheme increases the persistence of inflation is in widespread used; however, in reality, this ad hoc indexation setup is inconsistent with the real data. Moreover, there is extensive evidence on micro price data indicates that heterogeneity in price stickiness is a\r\ncommonly found feature of price setting throughout the Euro area. Therefore, this thesis aims at incorporating this micro price evidence in an elaborated New Keynesian\r\nDynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model by using a Generalised- Taylor-Economy (GTE) and Generalised-Calvo (GC) price settings. This thesis first presents the models, which are an extension of Smets-Wouters (SW) model (2003) which replaces Calvo with indexation price setting with heterogeneous price settings. In these new price settings, the micro evidence of heterogeneous price stickiness is directly emerged into macro DSGE models. The findings suggest that heterogeneous price stickiness can generate long-lived inflation and output persistence. Indirect inference is then used to evaluate the DSGE models of the French economy under different price settings. The results of the testing show that all models with differentprice settings are comprehensively rejected. The models are then estimated with Bayesian techniques as SW (2003) by using seven key macroeconomic observables.\r\nThe results show that the GC model has the best performance. The rankings of the different price setting models are also proven to be robust to different priors and\r\nobservables. Indirect inference evaluations are then conducted based on Bayesian estimated models, and all models are rejected. Indirect inference is then used as an\r\nestimation method. The testing results are improved on all models. The GC model is still considered to be the best performance model among all of the different price\r\nsetting models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jiao, Jing"],"dc:date":"2012-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

At the same time the dual objectives are attacked and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) attempts to pack all the examinations into as short a period as possible while, at the same time, favoring a good spread of examinations for individual students. Most other published timetabling algorithms require the number time slots to be fixed in advance of any optimization for soft constraints, such as proximity costs.

These attacks can be successfully defended against using security technologies such as firewalls, IDS and anti-virus software, so attackers have developed new methods to spread their malicious code by using web pages, which can affect many more victims than the traditional approach. The attackers now use these websites to threaten users without the user’s knowledge or permission. The defence against such websites is less effective than traditional security products meaning the attackers have the advantage of being able to target a greater number of users.\r\nMalicious web pages attack users through their web browsers and the attack can occur even if the user only visits the web page; this type of attack is called a drive-by download attack. This dissertation explores how web-based attacks work and how users can be protected from this type of attack based on the behaviour of a remote web server. We propose a system that is based on the use of client Honeypot technology. The client Honeypot is able to scan malicious web pages based on their behaviour and can therefore work as an anomaly detection system. The proposed system has three main models: state machine, clustering and prediction models. All these three models work together in order to protect users from known and unknown web-based attacks.\r\nThis research demonstrates the challenges faced by end users and how the attacker can easily target systems using drive-by download attacks. In this dissertation we discuss how the proposed system works and the research challenges that we are trying to solve, such as how to group web-based attacks into behaviour groups, how to avoid attempts at obfuscation used by attackers and how to predict future malicious behaviour for a given web-based attack based on its behaviour in real time. Finally, we have demonstrate how the proposed system will work by implementing a prototype application and conducting a number of experiments to show how we were able to model, cluster and predict web-based attacks based on their behaviour. The experiment data was collected randomly from online blacklist websites.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alosefer, Yaser"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":8818514,"ep:Repository":83,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Quality assessment of service providers in a conformance-centric Service Oriented Architecture","bibo:abstract":"In a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), the goal of consumers is to discover and use services which lead to them experiencing the highest quality, such that their expectations and needs are satisfied. In supporting this discovery, quality assessment tools are required to establish the degree to which these expectations will be met by specific services. Traditional approaches to quality assessment in SOA assume that providers and consumers of services will adopt a performance-centric view of quality, which assumes that consumers will be most satisfied when they receive the highest absolute performance. However, adopting this approach does not consider the subjective nature of quality and will not necessarily lead to consumers receiving services that meet their individual needs. \r\nBy using existing approaches to quality assessment that assume a consumer\u0027s primary goal as being optimisation of performance, consumers in SOA are currently unable to effectively identify and engage with providers who deliver services that will best meet their needs. Developing approaches to assessment that adopt a more conformance-centric view of quality (where it is assumed that consumers are most satisfied when a service meets, but not necessarily exceeds, their individual expectations) is a challenge that must be addressed if consumers are to effectively adopt SOA as a means of accessing services.\r\nIn addressing the above challenge, this thesis develops a conformance-centric model of an SOA in which conformance is taken to be the primary goal of consumers. This model is holistic, in that it considers consumers, providers and assessment services and their relationship; and novel in that it proposes a set of rational provider behaviours that would be adopted in using a conformance-centric view of quality. Adopting such conformance-centric behaviour leads to observable and predictable patterns in the performance of the services offered by providers, due to the relationship that exists between the level of service delivered by the service and the expectation of the consumer. \r\nIn order to support consumers in the discovery of high quality services, quality assessment tools must be able to effectively assess past performance information about services, and use this as a prediction of future performance. In supporting consumers within a conformance-centric SOA, this thesis proposes and evaluates a new set of approaches to quality assessment which make use of the patterns in provider behaviour described above. The approaches developed are non-trivial – using a selection of adapted pattern classification and other statistical techniques to infer the behaviour of individual services at run-time and calculating a numerical measure of confidence for each result that can be used by consumers to combine assessment information with other evidence. The quality assessment approaches are evaluated within a software implementation of a conformance-centric SOA, whereby they are shown to lead to consumers experiencing higher quality than with existing performance-centric approaches.\r\nBy introducing conformance-centric principles into existing real-world SOA, consumers will be able to evaluate and engage with providers that offer services that have been differentiated based on consumer expectation. The benefits of such capability over the current state-of-the-art in SOA are twofold. Firstly, individual consumers will receive higher quality services, and therefore will increase the likelihood of their needs being effectively satisfied. Secondly, the availability of assessment tools which acknowledge the conformance-centric nature of consumers will encourage providers to offer a range of services for consumers with varying expectation, rather than simply offering a single service that aims to delivery maximum performance. This recognition will allow providers to use their resources more efficiently, leading to reduced costs and increased profitability. Such benefits can only be realised by adopting a conformance-centric view of quality across the SOA and by providing assessment services that operate effectively in such environments. This thesis proposes, develops and evaluates models and approaches that enable the achievement of this goal.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shercliff, Gareth"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research questions attempted to develop an understanding of the relationship between their perceptions of and attitudes to palliative care and consequent decision making.\r\nMethods:\r\nThe chosen methodological approach was interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) which supported exploration of the consultants experience together with facilitating their understanding of their idiographic experience.  Ten minimally structured individual interviews were conducted with four cardiologists, four oncologists and four old age psychiatrists.  Consistent with the philosophical approach of IPA their individual experiences were analysed - descriptively, conceptually and linguistically.  The experiences of each consultant group were then combined to elicit their shared experience before being compared across group.  The work was interpreted by detailed discussion which considered the structural context, the influence of the macro, meso and micro levels of health care and the political, historical and clinical aspects of palliative care on their experience.  Deepr exploration was undertaken by considering the phenomenological concept of the life-world, \u0027habitus\u0027 and the philosophical and theoretical contexts of knowing and clinical thinking. The use of language and specifically metaphor supported increased understanding.\r\nFindings: The consultants\u0027 experiences (both personal and professional) reflected the primacy of their clinical expertise and their uncertainty as to whether a palliative care referral was always in the best interests of the patient group.  The requirement for prognostication, identifying the transitions from active to palliative care was especially problematic for heart failure and dementia patients due to the uncertain disease trajectory.  Many of the consultants identified the personal cost and clinical dilemmas of determining the end of life.  Their stories, in particular identified the difficulties in establishing and communicating an end of life prognosis reflecting their unique personal and professional responsibility as medical consultants which contradicts the perceived contemporary dominance of multi professional working.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anstey, Sally"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.302321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.251374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.248484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.244406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53693,"sim:weight":0.23885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.225824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A Bayesian and indirect approach","bibo:abstract":"Abstract\r\nThis thesis makes three main contributions to the literature on Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models in Macroeconomics. As no previous studies have studied the Chinese economy from the perspective of DSGE, the first contribution of this thesis is estimating a DSGE model for China through a Bayesian approach using the Chinese quarterly post-economic reform data representing the main macro-economic time series 1978.Q1-2007.Q4. Second, this thesis adopts a new method of evaluating macro-economic models in its evaluation of the estimated DSGE model for China. Rather than the classical methods used to evaluate a macro-economic model such as the Maximum Likelihood method, the method of Indirect Inference is used to test the DSGE model. This method differs from other methods in its adoption of a VAR as the auxiliary model that mimics reality. A hybrid model is adopted to improve the ability of the DSGE model to replicate real world results and compared to the original New Keynesian version of the DSGE model developed by Smets and Wouters. Third, considering the restrictions that the prior distribution imposed on the estimated parameters of the model in the Bayesian estimation, the estimation method of Indirect Inference is used in the last chapter of this thesis and compared with the Bayesian estimation.\r\nThe results of the Bayesian estimation are in agreement with most of the existing literature on DSGE models. However, the results of Indirect Inference testing suggest that the adopted DSGE model does not closely resemble the real data, with a Hybrid model with 50% weight on the NK part performing significantly better. Indirect Inference estimation produces the same results and provides a better estimation of the model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dai, Li"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69506,"sim:weight":0.212257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108691,"sim:weight":0.180409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.168995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930801,"sim:weight":0.145857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573447,"sim:weight":0.139553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In plants it has a clear role at the DNA damage/ DNA  replication  checkpoints.  I  aimed  to  discover  the  functional  significance  of  interactions between WEE1 and other cellular proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana  and Nicotiana tabacum. First I examined effects of ectopic expression of Arabidopsis WEE1 (Arath;WEE1) in transgenic tobacco and tobacco WEE1 (Nicta;WEE1) in transgenic Arabidopsis. Western blotting using a plant WEE1 antibody showed that expression of Nicta;WEE1 in Arabidopsis caused increases in total WEE1 protein. The response of primary root length, numbers of lateral roots and primordia, and meristem length to zeocin (a DNA damaging agent) and hydroxyurea, (which perturbs DNA replication), resembled the wee1-1 insertional mutant rather than Arath;WEE1 over-expression. Expression of Arath;WEE1 in tobacco resulted in reduced WEE1 protein but also induced similar phenotypic changes as Nicta;WEE1 expression in Arabidopsis under zeocin and HU stress. I concluded that interactions  with  cellular  proteins  in  the  alien  species  resulted  in  down-regulation  of  WEE1 activity.\r\n\r\nIn  a  yeast  2-hybrid  screen  Arath;WEE1  interacted  with  the  glutathione-S-transferase  protein, GSTF9. To  test the functionality  of this interaction  I analysised  the root and cell cycle phase phenotypes of single mutants: wee1-1 and gstf9 and I generated the double mutant wee1-1;gstf9. I demonstrated that both Arath;WEE1 and GSTF9 have roles in the DNA replication and damage checkpoints, but largely act in different genetic pathways.\r\n\r\nArath;WEE1  also  interacts  with  GF14ω,  a 14-3-3  protein  in  a yeast  2-hybrid  assay.  In  other eukaryotes this stabilizes WEE1. I confirmed that over-expression of GFF14ω in transgenic Arabidopsis (GFF14ω OEX) results in a very similar root phenotype to over-expression of Arath;WEE1 as predicted from a stabilization of WEE1. However the GFF14ω OEX phenotype was not abolished in a wee1-1 genetics background.indicating that Arath;WEE1is not required for the action of GF14ω.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rafiei, Golnaz"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.123401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26919,"sim:weight":0.0798823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.0767859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One common method for adding value to such products is through the small-scale production of high quality food products that command price premiums in the marketplace, through the targeting of niche consumer demands.\r\nDespite a growing interest in this form of value adding, formal understanding of the mechanics of how the businesses that produce these products operate remains limited.\r\nThis thesis attempts to contribute towards this  understanding by taking innovation as a central point of analysis. It aims to contribute both towards our theoretical\r\nunderstanding of micro food firm dynamics and, practically, towards the development of effective policy tools to support food micro firm supply chains. This is achieved\r\nthrough the development of a broad conceptual framework developed through a multidisciplinary literature review. Through this framework, a longitudinal study of six micro food firms is undertaken along with a comprehensive postal survey of Welsh food businesses. The empirical data is subsequently co-analysed and related back to the existing theoretical understanding of the research issues. The thesis\r\nconcludes by drawing upon a number of central issues that influence the development of food micro firms.\r\nAmong the findings of the research are that the aims and objectives of microfirm entrepreneurs are central to the development of the firm. Moreover, these are failing\r\nto be understood by both policymakers and mainstream food industry interests. In a broader context, the thesis argues that small scale quality food systems must learn to\r\nexist under the shadow of conventional interests, and follow development paths that are able to resist mainstream appropriation. Only the development of systems that\r\neffectively bridge the two production ethics in a form that ensures the integrity of small scale activities can enable the alternative values encompassed within many\r\nmicrofirm entrepreneurs to cease being alternative.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morley, Adrian Sherwin"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.242521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108980,"sim:weight":0.219298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340559,"sim:weight":0.202476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In essence, this analysis attempts to highlight the common theoretical assumptions and approaches often used to explain the cooperative interests of states within the context of regional and international discourse. Using these assumptions, it highlights potential motives, incentives, costs, and constraints that states may consider when determining the relative value of engaging in formally defined cooperative relationships with other states. \r\n\r\nThis work demonstrates how historical, demographic, political, economic, and geographic factors all determine the political character of both regimes and states in shaping how they view themselves in relation to their regional neighbours and other international powers. Specifically, it argues that states seek to formulate policies based upon these factors, effectively prioritizing their own interests and security with the objectives of self-preservation and maximization of prosperity within a global environment of competing states and regimes that essentially pursue the same objectives.    \r\n\r\nThe following chapters of this analysis are specifically concerned with the rationale behind the inter-GCC relationship, how it is defined, why the member states choose to cooperate, and what motivates them to cooperate under the guise of the GCC. Such an analysis is beneficial in assessing the evolution of the cooperative relationship of the GCC, providing meaningful insight into the progress of the alliance, its growth, its progress or lack thereof in promoting interests, and the role that it may play in the era of globalization. This analysis seeks to promote and substantiate the argument that the cooperative relationship upon which the GCC is based is essentially driven or motivated by security interests. In other words, it argues that the Security, sovereignty, stability, legitimacy, and welfare of GCC member states are the paramount interests of the regimes and frame their fundamental security ideals for the preservation and sustainability of their systems. What I mean by security above is not just the traditionalist views of security, which is the military, but security in its wider perspective that includes environmental, economic and social sectors at a local, regional and global level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Said, Nadia"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109143,"sim:weight":0.373841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.295911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.281538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85458,"sim:weight":0.251502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.237023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108611,"sim:weight":0.22056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108959,"sim:weight":0.217305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109140,"sim:weight":0.212955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29209,"sim:weight":0.210222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734370,"sim:weight":0.204683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.192344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108908,"sim:weight":0.180459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

High technology organisations, particularly, rely on knowledge workers to transfer human capital into intellectual capital by turning technological\r\nknowledge into products. Taiwan is renowned for information and communication technology (ICT) product design and manufacture. This research uses Taiwan’s high technology industry as a sample to examine the recruitment, selection and retention practices for knowledge workers.\r\nThree organisation ownership types exist in Taiwan’s context: Taiwanese-owned,foreign-owned and non-private. This study asks: what are the current recruitment,\r\nselection and retention practices for knowledge workers in Taiwan’s high technology industry? Are there any differences in the three types of ownership group? Do\r\nownership groups influence knowledge workers’ decisions to join or stay in their organisations? To answer these questions, a quantitative survey was conducted from\r\nSeptember 2009 to March 2010, and two hundred valid questionnaire responses were collected (a response rate: 67%). Additionally, interviews were conducted with human\r\nresource managers in 10 organisations under various ownerships to collect information that was unobtainable in the questionnaire survey. This research contributes empirical evidence about the current recruitment/selection\r\nand retention practices for knowledge workers in Taiwan’s high technology industry. The results showed that organisations within various ownership groups preferred to\r\nuse different practices. Taiwanese-owned firms predominantly used on-line agents to recruit knowledge workers and relied on employee ownership bonus programmes to\r\nattract and retain knowledge workers. Foreign-owned firms, significantly, used head hunters. They provided their knowledge workers with high base salaries, challenging\r\nand interesting work, and influential power over work-related decisions. Non-private organisations were significantly different in their adoption of company websites. They offered good training programmes, opportunities to access new technology, and attractive work-life balance, reflecting their research-oriented ethos.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Yi-Hui"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Reviews of the tests involved and instruments available are detailed in Chapter II and III.\r\nChapter IV presents the various validation experiments carried out on the Tobii X120 eye tracker, concentrating on technical specifications such as, linearity range, optimum measurement distance and setup (with and without chin rest). We also investigated the effect of wearing different types of lens materials and pupil size measurements on the eye tracker system. We established the inter-examiner agreement of cover test measurements on groups of non-strabismic and strabismic subjects. This study, as detailed in Chapter V, involved collaboration with two clinical orthoptists. We found a good inter-examiner agreement for both the non-strabismic and strabismic cover tests. We further investigated the use of the eye tracker in providing more reliable findings for cover test measurements as compared to the conventional cover test (Chapter VI). Finally we extended the investigation to a number of different clinical subjects attending the Bristol Eye Hospital (Chapter VII) in order to evaluate our purpose-developed monocular calibration routine.\r\nPerforming quantitative eye movement analysis will provide valuable additional information in any clinical investigation of patients with ophthalmological and/or neurological disorders, leading to greater precision in diagnosis. Traditional methods for the evaluation of oculomotor disorders rely on the diagnostic and therapeutic judgements by the examining clinicians and subjective responses from the patient. However, the use of currently available eye movement recording system will provide valuable alternatives for obtaining more objective and quantitative measurements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohamad Shahimin, Mizhanim"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Upon deployment in the field, these sensing devices form an ad hoc network using wireless links or cables to communicate with each other. Sensor networks are increasingly used to support emergency responders in the field usually requiring many sensing tasks to be supported at the same time. By a sensing task we mean any job that requires some amount of sensing resources to be accomplished such as localizing persons in need of help or detecting an event. Tasks might share the usage of a sensor, but more often compete to exclusively control it because of the limited number of sensors and overlapping needs with other tasks. Sensors are in fact scarce and in high demand. In such cases, it might not be possible to satisfy the requirements of all tasks using available sensors. Therefore, the fundamental question to answer is: “Which sensor should be allocated to which task?\", which summarizes the Multi-Sensor Task Allocation (MSTA) problem. \r\nWe focus on a particular MSTA instance where the environment does not provide enough information to plan for future allocations constraining us to perform instantaneous allocation. We look at this problem in both static setting, where all task requests from emergency responders arrive at once, and dynamic setting, where tasks arrive and depart over time. We provide novel solutions based on centralized and distributed approaches. We evaluate their performance using mainly simulations on randomly generated problem instances; moreover, for the dynamic setting, we consider also feasibility of deploying part of the distributed allocation system on user mobile devices. Our solutions scale well with different number of task requests and manage to improve the utility of the network, prioritizing the most important tasks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pizzocaro, Diego"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The faults comprise lower strain fracture networks, to higher strain breccias that form tabular volumes around a principal slip zone hosting gouge or cataclasite. Samples representative of these fault zone components are used for static experimental permeability measurement. Results indicate that within the appropriate effective pressure (depth) range (10–90 MPa: ~0.3 to ~3.0 km), basalt-hosted faults evolve from low strain (\u003c 1m displacement), relatively low-permeability (\u003c10–17 m2) structures, to high strain (≥ 1m displacement), relatively high-permeability (\u003e10–17 m2) structures. Sample analyses reveal that static permeability is controlled by the development of: a) fault-parallel clay alteration (decreasing permeability); and b) porous zeolite vein connectivity due to hydrofracture (increasing permeability). Fault-parallel permeability is increased relative to the host rock, while fault-normal permeability is low throughout fault rock evolution. This configuration will tend to promote across-fault compartmentalization and along-fault fluid flow, facilitating migration between relatively high-permeability horizons (e.g. vesicular flow unit tops and siliciclastic horizons), bypassing the bulk of the stratigraphy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walker, Richard James","Holdsworth, Robert E.","Armitage, Peter J.","Faulkner, Daniel R."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":87870,"sim:weight":0.432181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108101,"sim:weight":0.430207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29462,"sim:weight":0.419048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109109,"sim:weight":0.398523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108605,"sim:weight":0.271693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66284,"sim:weight":0.263429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71956,"sim:weight":0.256224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84986,"sim:weight":0.240418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108753,"sim:weight":0.231074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85058,"sim:weight":0.212801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108176,"sim:weight":0.177212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266869,"sim:weight":0.163095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85004,"sim:weight":0.154559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1480123,"sim:weight":0.12299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108048,"sim:weight":0.105716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Caregivers may be unprepared for new roles which require assimilation of a variety of skills and information.\r\n\r\nAim: The aim of the study was to explore the understanding, knowledge and fears of informal care givers of stroke survivors during the hospital discharge period.\r\n \r\nMethod: Using a Phenomenological study design, 2 Semi structured interviews were conducted with each of 4 caregivers of first time stroke survivors to identify experiences  of care giving 2 weeks pre and 3 months post discharge. Thematic analysis was undertaken. South Wales LREC gave ethical approval. \r\n\r\nResults:Caregivers demonstrated a clear understanding that stroke would lead to significant changes in lifestyle. They all felt that they had lacked knowledge about stroke and how to care for a person with stroke. There was disparity in expectations of the impact of depression and personality changes in all respondents. All reported a lack of effective, personalised communication and coordinated planned team work in both hospital and community services. Three caregivers also found supporting exercise routines a greater burden both physically and emotionally than expected.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The experiences, challenges and concerns of the informal caregivers of stroke survivors vary but there are some common themes which could shape the support offered to this group of people during the discharge period. There is work that could be done to improve communication, making it more specific to individuals. The burden of supporting home exercise is an area for future research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Griffiths, Adele","Busse-Morris, Monica","Sarin, Beverly"],"dc:date":"2012-06-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The communication\r\nnetwork that is shifting towards smaller micro-cell or nano-cell network has also\r\nmotivated the design of the RF power amplifier to be simple, compact and cost\r\nefficient. In this research work, a novel technique for efficiency and linearity\r\nimprovement of the RFPA is presented. A simplistic approach in the technique called\r\n‘Auxiliary Envelope Tracking\u0027 (AET) system has promoted the design for small and\r\nstraightforward AET tracking generator, a key component in the system. The use of\r\nlow cost components in the AET tracking generator has made the technique\r\ncommercially attractive.\r\nThe AET technique proposes a separation in generating DC and AC\r\ncomponents of the AET signal that biases the drain of the RFPA. The separation\r\neases the generation of the signals resulting in low power consumption that leads to\r\nefficiency improvement. The investigation of the gain characteristic of gallium\r\nnitride (GaN) RFPA has shown an important RFPA attribute where the gain varied\r\nsubstantially as the drain voltage increases. By using the AET technique, the gain\r\ncharacteristic is harnessed to get linearity improvement.\r\nIn order to validate the technique, AET measurement systems for two-carrier\r\nand WCDMA signals were developed and experimented. A special Class AB RFPA\r\nis designed and implemented to use dedicatedly for this investigation. In two-carrier\r\nsignal measurement, a tracking generator is developed that consists of an envelope\r\namplifier (EA) and a diplexer. The RFPA and the tracking generator are then\r\ncombined to be an integrated AET block. In order to accommodate the high peak-toaverage\r\nratio (PAR) and high bandwidth WCDMA signal, a broadband RF\r\ntransformer was designed as part of the AET tracking generator to replace the\r\ndiplexer.\r\nThe two-carrier and WCDMA signals measurement results have proven that\r\nthe AET technique is a valid technique for efficiency and linearity improvement. The\r\nimprovements were achieved with simple, compact and cost-effective\r\nimplementation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yusoff, Zubaida"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929809,"sim:weight":0.243387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108820,"sim:weight":0.206085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85232,"sim:weight":0.196868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23351,"sim:weight":0.192228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176817,"sim:weight":0.16993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54114,"sim:weight":0.169105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33709,"sim:weight":0.168498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108810,"sim:weight":0.165932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85296,"sim:weight":0.156982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26670,"sim:weight":0.156112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653108,"sim:weight":0.153139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931857,"sim:weight":0.143696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108948,"sim:weight":0.141843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931258,"sim:weight":0.132839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23098,"sim:weight":0.127475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51544,"sim:weight":0.116946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929901,"sim:weight":0.0826505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Even where a man is considered to be the primary abuser in a family, the usual approach is to concentrate on the mother\u0027s “failure to protect” the children. This article presents an analysis of data from an ethnographic study in a child and family social work team in the United Kingdom, which set out to explore this concentration on mothering and avoidance of men. The article outlines some discourses of masculinity in the occupational culture of child protection social work: men as a threat, men as no use, men as irrelevant, men as absent, men as no different from women, and men as better than women. The author\u0027s contention is that if injustice to women in social work provision is to be addressed, these gendered constructions of clients have to be made explicit and their implications understood.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scourfield, Jonathan Bryn"],"dc:date":"2001-07","doi":"10.1177/1097184X01004001004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"NSPCC.

This has involved the design and development of a fabrication process for a novel micro-fluidic coupled-cavity laser sensor. The efficiency of the etched inner laser facets of this device have been identified as a key determinant of the device behaviour. The multi-section gain characterization technique has been used to measure the efficiency of these facets to be η \u003d 0.48 ± 0.13.\r\nPerturbation of the optical coupling between the two laser sections of the device can induce a wavelength shift in the laser output of Δλ \u003d 20 ± 5 Å. This wavelength change is attributed to the difference in the threshold gain requirements of the coupled-cavity and individual cavity modes of the device. A multi-mode travelling wave rate equation model has been used to predict that the size of this effect can be maximized by optimizing the cavity lengths of the device. For the AlGaInP quantum well material used in this work the coupling effect is maximized by using the shortest cavity lengths possible that can still achieve laser action.\r\nThe utility of including a segmented contact system to the coupled-cavity design has also been investigated. This modification enables wavelength tuning via the gain lever effect and self-pulsation through saturable absorption. A wavelength tuning range of Δλ \u003d 1.2 ± 0.2 nm has been measured for a single cavity laser with a segmented contact length ratio of 4:1. This tuning behaviour has been attributed to the carrier density dependence of the net modal gain peak. Rate equation modelling has been used to interpret the self-pulsation behaviour of the segmented contact device and to demonstrate how optical pumping of a saturable absorber can increase the sensitivity of the coupled-cavity device.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thomas, Robert"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":32691,"sim:weight":0.439203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25920,"sim:weight":0.386385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25940,"sim:weight":0.351237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23879,"sim:weight":0.32592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26656,"sim:weight":0.304302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268391,"sim:weight":0.283147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.258214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28584,"sim:weight":0.227417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28907,"sim:weight":0.220284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23394,"sim:weight":0.210277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33262,"sim:weight":0.20209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22850,"sim:weight":0.18098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.172441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22843,"sim:weight":0.167332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22901,"sim:weight":0.165982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26192,"sim:weight":0.16128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Resistance to\r\ntamoxifen is however a considerable issue with cells utilising a number of molecular mechanisms to bypass the growth inhibition caused by blocking ER activity. This move towards an anti-hormone resistant state from an antihormone\r\nresponsive state is associated with the transition to a much more aggressive phenotype including increased proliferation and also invasiveness.\r\nThus unfortunately, acquisition of tamoxifen resistance is not only associated with a recurrence of breast cancer, but this cancer is also much more aggressive in nature with fewer treatment options available than the initial\r\ncancer.\r\nThis study has identified Lyn kinase as increased in tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cells compared to oestrogen-responsive breast cancer cells. Subsequent\r\nremoval of Lyn kinase from tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cell lines using RNAi technology led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, increased\r\napoptosis and also a decrease in migration and invasion. A mechanism has been suggested whereby Lyn kinase is involved in a calcium dependent zinc wave which ultimately leads to the activation of tyrosine kinases.\r\nMetastasis to other sites in the body is ultimately responsible for fatalities due to breast cancer and so being able to block its action is key to treating breast\r\ncancer in the clinic. Therefore identifying Lyn kinase as a gene target that leads to the advancement of breast cancer to a more aggressive state provides a powerful tool for treating breast cancer in the clinic.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hendley, Rhiannon"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1397434,"sim:weight":0.40304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.324257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397486,"sim:weight":0.197812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.182415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340645,"sim:weight":0.16817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.153829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23816,"sim:weight":0.147203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.138786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.105525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0977989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This advocacy of shared services has advanced ahead of academic research and evidence.\r\nThis thesis aims to assess whether using this model results in reduced costs and improved performance in local government. A theory-driven research framework is used to assess the impact of using this form of partnership.\r\nThe dominant theoretical rationale underpinning shared services is the intention to create a partnership to generate economies of scale, achieving reduced costs and improved performance. The model is thought to benefit from effective relationships which reduce supervision costs, and is dependent on effective implementation processes. The research project also incorporates counter-perspectives, which suggest there are limits to economies of scale, and potential challenges to the partnership relationship.\r\nThe findings of the study indicate that, firstly, in comparison with other models of service delivery, clients of shared services report a more negative perception of performance. Secondly, it seems respondents in those authorities using shared services extensively are more likely to perceive that performance has declined. Thirdly, qualitative data indicate that shared corporate services have been implemented in a limited form, most often constituting a shared management arrangement, perceived to deliver cost reduction but with little evidence of performance improvement. Finally, the findings offer limited evidence of economies of scale, although the data provides some support for the notion that high-trust partnership relationships can reduce supervision costs, and conversely, finding that partnership working can also result in disruption or dysfunction which may bring the partnership to an end.\r\nThe thesis offers recommendations for theory, research and policy. Overall, it would seem that the effectiveness of shared service partnerships is highly contingent upon the form they take, the effectiveness of the implementation process and a clear understanding of the associated benefits and risks","bibo:AuthorList":["Pike, Thomas"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.253726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.244987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.204705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Inserting a request in a route is either based on a first acceptance criterion, in which a request is inserted in the first route where a feasible insertion is found, or a best acceptance criterion,\r\nin which a request is inserted in the estimated best route for insertion.

These approaches rely on iterative improvements to a starting solution, involving slight alterations to the routes (i.e. neighbourhood moves), moving a node to a diff�erent part of a solution, swapping\r\nnodes or inverting sections of a tour, for example. When working with standard VRPs, where the costs of the arcs do not vary with advancing time, evaluating changes to the total cost following a neighbourhood move is a simple process: simply subtract the costs of the links removed from the solution and add the costs for the new links. When\r\na time varying aspect (e.g. congestion) is included in the costs, these calculations become estimations rather than exact values.

Our method is the first to be applied directly to the gravitational-wave (GW) signal, rather than the orbital motion. The GW signal is in general less contaminated by gauge effects, which, in moving-puncture simulations, limit orbital-motion-based measurements of the eccentricity to an uncertainty of Δe∼0.002, making it difficult to reduce the eccentricity below this value. Our new method can reach eccentricities below 10-3 in one or two iteration steps; we find that this is well below the requirements for GW astronomy in the advanced detector era. Our method can be readily adapted to any compact-binary simulation with GW emission, including black-hole-binary simulations which use alternative approaches and neutron-star-binary simulations.

Violence \u0026 aggression in the workplace is a growing problem worldwide. The healthcare sector is particularly affected with staff in the accident \u0026 emergency (A\u0026E) department being the most at risk. Investigation has centred on medical staff in particular with a distinct lack of research regarding radiographers. The aim of this study was to gather the opinion of radiographers on their experience of violence and aggression in A\u0026E.\r\nMethod.  The sample was chosen by use of convenience sampling, thus the sample group consisted of all radiographers (n\u003d31) in a major trauma centre in South Wales. The data was collected by a self administered questionnaire and good internal consistency reliability was found using Crohnbach’s alpha test. The questionnaire was piloted and readability issues were rectified for the final questionnaire. Face and content validity were assured by the use of a focus group and reviewing appropriate literature.\r\nResults.  94% (n\u003d29) of respondents had experienced violence \u0026 aggression at least once. Also it seems that radiographers have little knowledge of the Welsh Assembly Government violence \u0026 aggression passport. In addition, some respondents (n\u003d19) felt that training should have an increased “hands on” approach and only 12 respondents reported high confidence of dealing with physical aggression following training.\r\nConclusions. The study shows that violence \u0026 aggression is an alarming issue for A\u0026E radiographers and is a greater problem than has been found previously. Additionally, it appears that even with training, there is a low level of confidence in dealing with physical violence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rogers, Hywel","Bowditch, Chloe"],"dc:date":"2012-11-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Twenty five children with Cerebral Palsy (2-17 years) were interviewed about their experiences of adapted cycling. The objective was to analyse their response to their experiences of adapted cycling by including the use of pictures and photographs.  \r\n\r\nThis method was developed from an understanding of Mosaic methods. Pictures of cycling in different environments were displayed for the child to see. The interview questions were phrased in a closed way to enable a simple yes/ no response.  These could be indicated by eye pointing or hand gesture as well as their usual form of communication. Pictures of happy and sad faces were also used to ask the child to describe how cycling made them feel. Some children had photographs of themselves cycling in the diary they were keeping, which were also used.  The two researchers carrying out the interviews were confident to deal with alternate forms of communication, but reflected that it was hard not to lead the interview. \r\n\r\nThe interview data was transcribed then sent back to the participants and their parents for verification. The interviews were analysed using a template approach by highlighting pertinent quotes. The emerging themes related to the benefits to the children in terms of learning new skills, social participation and the impact on their wider family and friends. Adapted cycling has given them an opportunity to enjoy a physical activity that has health benefits.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pickering, Dawn","Horrocks, Lyn","Visser, Karen Susan","Todd, Gabriela"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study measures post-treatment corrosion rates in accelerated corrosion environments using either weight change or oxygen consumption to identify how removing chloride ions affects corrosion rate. Archaeological iron nails, treated individually in either alkaline sulphite or nitrogen-deoxygenated sodium hydroxide, were exposed to 75°C and 75% relative humidity (RH) together with untreated objects from the same archaeological sites. Weight change of the objects was used to monitor corrosion. Iron nails treated for two weeks in alkaline sulphite to extract chloride were placed in individual sealed containers controlled to 80% RH and the oxygen consumption within the jars was measured. Digestion determined the chloride content of each object. 77% of the treated objects showed no weight gain and no visible signs of corrosion, whereas only 13% of the untreated objects displayed no signs of corrosion behaviour. There was a significant correlation between chloride content and weight gain; treated objects with \u003c400 ppm chloride content showed no corrosion behaviour. Corrosion of treated objects was attributed to incomplete treatment: 93% of objects treated to \u003c5 ppm in the final solution bath displayed no corrosion behaviour. The two-week alkaline sulphite treatment significantly reduced chloride content and corrosion rate, suggesting that removing the most soluble chloride has the largest impact on reducing corrosion rates. Based on these results, desalination of iron objects to enhance their stability offers a valuable option for reducing corrosion rates which should increase object lifespan.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rimmer, Melanie","Watkinson, David Edward","Wang, Quanyu"],"dc:date":"2012-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":28352,"sim:weight":0.46556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29466,"sim:weight":0.155616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.116851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.0867884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108734,"sim:weight":0.0816585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734357,"sim:weight":0.0715686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25847,"sim:weight":0.071553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26546,"sim:weight":0.0670889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316354,"sim:weight":0.0616219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Grid Methodology is based on the discretisation of the object to allow the measurement, calculation, visualisation and analysis of part distortion in terms of linear and shear deviations from nominal. A single test piece and routine measurement procedure are utilised to estimate the distribution of the above entities; calculated in a similar way to the geometrical characteristics of strains in solid mechanics.\r\nThe methodology was applied to research the causes of inaccuracy in the vertical direction of SLS Polystyrene. The presence of a critical dimension in height from where the distortion changes from shrinkage to extension was revealed and explained. The methodology was also utilised to estimate the necessary scaling factors to improve part accuracy, based on the calculated distortions. Implementation of the Grid Method to Micro Projection Stereolithography resulted in the ability to describe and estimate curling distortion in terms of angular deviations from nominal and separate it from linear distortions.\r\n- ii -\r\nFurthermore the application of the GM to the emerging micro-nano manufacturing sector has been shown to support the assessment of process capability.

Cells can be seen to react different to the same stimulus despite being the same cell type and under the same conditions. Single cell analysis of a population is, therefore, crucial to understanding the nature of these differences. Using different technologies to study a single cell can help a researcher gather more data on the nature of these differences.\r\nThe first part of this study looked at the development of a microwell array as a technique to allow correlative microscopy of non-adherent cell types. Laser ablation was used to generate microwells in both glass and the silicone polymer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Different methods were tested to increase quality of the microwells with the use of a sacrificial layer proving successful. Microwells were determined to be suitable for both live cell imaging and scanning electron microscopy imaging with correlative microscopy of non-adherent cells demonstrated. A new microwell design to allow the tracking of a single well through different imaging steps including sectioning was devised.\r\nSurface modification was required to make PDMS more cytophilic and different methods were investigated in the next part of this thesis. More cytocompatible surfaces were produced for PDMS using silanisation of the surface to produce amine moieties proved the most successful.\r\nIn the final part of the thesis the cell penetrating peptide (CPP) octaargine was investigated along with the pro-apoptotic peptides PAD and the Bcl-2 converter peptide. The blebbing effects of the two peptides were analysed using non-adherent cells in microwells and fixed cells on a normal surface.

This study has investigated ryanodine receptor (RyR) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and several potassium (K+) channels which might be neuroprotective, such as the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (BK) and adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channel, in both neuronal and astrocytoma cell lines. The reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain react (PCR) results in this Thesis show that the messages of RyR, BK channel and ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP) exist at the messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) level in those cell lines. And, the expression of RyRIII message was found being increased in SH-SY5Y cells but decreased in NTERA-2 cells after differentiation. The BK channel was confirmed as functional in SH-SY5Y cells with patch clamp recording. Cell insults which increase intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), such as cobalt (II) chloride (CoCl2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), beta-amyloid (Aβ1-42) and glutamate, were found to reduce cell number in those cell lines in cell proliferation MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt] assays, and the cells with higher expression of RyRIII message were more sensitive to CoCl2 and H2O2 insults. In cell proliferation assays testing RyR or K+ channel modulators in the presence of insults, it has been found that generic blockade of RyR or K+ channel might be neuroprotective, and the activation of RyR or BK channel and the blockade of KATP channel may aggravate the insults. Selective blockade of RyRI and RyRII cannot protect the cells, which probably indicates that RyRIII is the key target in neuroprotection. Activators of the KATP channel cannot protect the cells at a low dose of CoCl2 but might be protective at a high dose, although cromakalim was an exception. Hence, blockade of RyRIII and the BK channel, and activation of the KATP channel, could be possible neuroprotective strategies. Future study should measure [Ca2+]i and cell apoptosis through Ca2+ imaging and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) respectively, and design selective a RyRIII blocker.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhang, Jin"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5842965,"sim:weight":0.267466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340567,"sim:weight":0.205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.141719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.133418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.131976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.123184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The\r\nresearch starts with an investigation of high efficient operation modes based on\r\nwaveform engineering. The outcome of the research can be divided into two main\r\nparts: The first concerns an analysis of high efficient modes of operation. The second\r\npart builds on first part looking at the PA’s efficiency-bandwidth perspective\r\nto design a wide band high efficient PA.\r\nThe first part of the thesis, introduces a novel linear high efficient PA mode termed\r\nInjection Power Amplifier (IPA) that exceeds drain efficiency of 90% without\r\nrelying on the nonlinearity of a PA at the compression region. This is achieved by\r\npresenting appropriate negative harmonic impedances to a transistor to reduce the\r\ndissipated power, thus, increasing the efficiency of conversion of DC to fundamental\r\nRF power. The theoretical analysis of this mode is presented and a validation\r\nmeasurement has been carried out using an active load-pull system.

Furthermore, a PA structure that is based on two parallel PAs\r\n(main PA and auxiliary PA) has been proposed along with the practical circuit realization\r\nof the IPA mode.

It focuses on the opposition to the Council in the Marches of Wales and revises the traditional picture of an undifferentiated and uniform attack on prerogative government by the Commons. Rather, this essay uncovers a more complex mixture of sectional interest groups coming together to oppose the Council. It reveals how long-standing local grievances in the border shires of western England were swept up and radicalised by common lawyers’ opposition to non-common law jurisdictions. An important context for the assault on the Marcher Council was the prevailing anxiety over tyranny and arbitrary government, something which had been given a sharper edge by the trial of the earl of Strafford, lord president of the Council\u0027s sister body in northern England. The article also employs new material to discuss those who struggled to defend the Council, and who marshalled creative legal arguments in an effort to salvage it from the wreckage of the king\u0027s prerogative instruments. A powerful coalition brought the Marcher Council to its knees by mid-1642, although it was never formally abolished. The article also utilises a previously unknown draft bill for removing the Council in the Marches, and reveals parliament\u0027s plans for undertaking the most sweeping transformation of the legal landscape in Wales and western England since the Acts of Union a century before.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bowen, Lloyd"],"dc:date":"2007","doi":"10.1093/ehr","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This thesis contributes to the better understanding of complex earthing systems such as earth grids and wind turbine earthing system behaviour under high frequency and transient conditions including voltage distributions along the length of the electrode.\r\nThe frequency and time domain responses of earth electrodes (vertical and horizontal earth electrodes and earth grids) were quantified for soil resistivity ranged from 10Ωm to 10kΩm. Practical wind turbine earthing system models were developed to account for the additional effects of the above–ground tower structure of the wind turbine and also to consider the benefits of various enhancements to the earthing system. Simulations using 1/5μs and 8/20μs impulse currents were carried out, and a number of parameters were quantified; these include the earth potential rise and the voltage distributions at ground surface level. In particular, the contribution of mitigating techniques, such as rings and rods were derived. The computations allowed determination of touch and step voltages.\r\nThe results show that the performance of an earth electrode depends on a number of factors such as soil resistivity and permittivity and electrode dimensions, and it was found that significant inductive effects dominate at high frequency. Thus, the ability of a horizontal earth electrode to reduce the earth potential rise is limited because, beyond a certain length known as the effective length, no further reduction is obtained. The effective length was determined experimentally by incrementally increasing the length of the test electrode. The experimental and simulation results show reasonably close agreement. Furthermore, reasonable prediction of the effective length may be possible using simple empirically derived equations.\r\nThe thesis proposes a new method to increase the effective length of in-ground horizontal earth electrodes and the effective area of earth grids. It is proposed that an additional insulated parallel an above ground conductor is bonded to the horizontal electrode at suitable points along its length. Field tests show that the addition to such enhancement reduces inductance effects and helps dissipation of injected currents, so that a greater length of buried earth conductor is utilised, and this contributes to an additional reduction in the earth impedance. Hence, the earth potential rise at the point of current injection is reduced. Enhancing the earthing system in this way results in a significant reduction in the transient potentials developed at the base of the turbine structure. These TEPR reductions produce associated reductions in touch and step voltages.","bibo:AuthorList":["El Mghairbi, Ahmed"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85232,"sim:weight":0.315594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108948,"sim:weight":0.253448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108820,"sim:weight":0.236535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176817,"sim:weight":0.233893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57302,"sim:weight":0.232855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108096,"sim:weight":0.230079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734349,"sim:weight":0.226748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33738,"sim:weight":0.22249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27093,"sim:weight":0.208339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85296,"sim:weight":0.203032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28485,"sim:weight":0.192195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.189811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.186967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53534,"sim:weight":0.178323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.17404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653108,"sim:weight":0.166601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108810,"sim:weight":0.165456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24089,"sim:weight":0.156736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A method of wavelet regularization is proposed for the\r\npractical recovery of the continuous spectrum over a limited range of relaxation\r\ntimes. Working with logarithmic variables (log-frequency and log-time), it may\r\nbe seen that the loss modulus is a scaling function transform of the continuous\r\nrelaxation spectrum. It is shown how the decomposition formula of Calder´on\r\nand Mallat may be used to reconstruct the spectrum from measurements of\r\nstorage and loss moduli. At practical levels of resolution, the spectrum may\r\nbe represented as a finite sum of hyperbolic scaling functions. There are two\r\nprincipal regularization mechanisms, namely, sparsity (the number of terms in\r\nthe sum), and scale (which controls both resolution and smoothness). The\r\nmethod of wavelet regularization is illustrated by recovering spectra from both\r\nsynthetic and real data.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Arthur Russell","Goulding, Neil"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53805,"sim:weight":0.362928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5843273,"sim:weight":0.359402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652681,"sim:weight":0.344634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5306359,"sim:weight":0.331077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67785,"sim:weight":0.317737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20154,"sim:weight":0.168185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59004,"sim:weight":0.163794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26749,"sim:weight":0.160902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.158207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21218,"sim:weight":0.15626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316063,"sim:weight":0.118228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Accounting scholars primarily based their research on agency theory. Recent papers focused on the affect of corporate governance on the determination of directors’ remuneration.\r\nThis study aims to investigate the effect of three main variables on directors’ remuneration – corporate governance variables, human capital attributes and firm performance. The study controls the effect of firm size, type of industry, leverage, diversification and location. 417 (50%) Malaysian public listed companies were selected using stratified random sampling for three years period from 2004 to 2006. Only non-financial companies are included in the sample because financial companies are subjected to different set of regulations in Malaysia.\r\nUsing multiple regression method, it is found that seven corporate governance variables are significantly related to directors’ remuneration. The study shows that board size, CEO-chairman duality role, proportion of independent directors and proportion of interlocking directors in the board are significantly related to directors’ remuneration. Proportion of non-executive directors in the board, percentage of indirect directors’ shareholding and percentage of block holders’ shareholdings are found to be negatively related to directors’ remuneration. Of the three human capital attributes studied, only executive directors’ average age and tenure are found to be significantly related to the level of directors’ remuneration. No evidence was found to conclude the role of qualification towards level of directors’ remuneration.\r\nThe model used was tested for its robustness using different set of alternative measures for some of its key variables. Corrections were also made to address other common problems associated with multiple regression such as outliers, non-normality of residuals, heteroscedasticity and multicollinearity. Finally, the study extends the analysis by running fixed effect model in order to control for firm specific effects. There are few discrepancies between the pooled regression model and fixed effect model result but this may be caused by little variation over time among governance variables. Finally, the findings further supports the agency theory by showing that, among Malaysian companies, performance still plays significant role in determining rewards for its directors","bibo:AuthorList":["Mustapha, Mohd Zulkhairi"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2734394,"sim:weight":0.480217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.400505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316147,"sim:weight":0.377899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316064,"sim:weight":0.350615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85650,"sim:weight":0.294877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108532,"sim:weight":0.274284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.264034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108567,"sim:weight":0.258525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85702,"sim:weight":0.253592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734375,"sim:weight":0.243341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.210451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.189316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85519,"sim:weight":0.175918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109146,"sim:weight":0.175139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.157281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This reaction is usually achieved through the use\r\nof two classes of catalyst. Firstly, mixed copper and manganese oxides designated ‘Hopcalite’ or\r\nCuMn2O4. Secondly, high surface area noble metal catalysts deposited on durable metal oxide\r\nsupports. Both of these classes of catalyst are investigated in this thesis, with the aim of\r\nproducing novel, reproducible, robust and active ambient temperature carbon monoxide\r\noxidation catalysts.\r\nIn this thesis, CuMn2O4 is sequentially doped and/or impregnated with low weightings (1-10%)\r\nof the transition metals V and Ce, noble metals Pd and Pt and metalloid Si in an attempt to\r\nimprove activity and moisture resistance. It was observed that doped V, Ce, Pd and Si are\r\ncatalytic poisons toward CuMn2O4. This is likely due to their interference in the Cu ↔ Mn redox\r\nmechanism. XRD investigations infer doped Pd is a structural promoter toward CuMn2O4,\r\nincreasing surface area and decreasing catalyst crystalinity. Impregnation of noble metals Pt and\r\nPd onto CuMn2O4 surface causes deactivation of the noble metals, most likely due to the\r\noxidation of Pt and Pd by Mn. No novel catalyst tested in this thesis displayed increased\r\nresistance to moisture deactivation.\r\nNoble metals Pt and Pd were impregnated upon 3 mm diameter Al2O3 spheres and tested for\r\nambient temperature CO oxidation activity. The positive synergy between the two metals is\r\nmeasured, and the most efficient Pt:Pd ratio is discovered to be ~ 1:4.\r\nA novel, atom efficient method, for synthesising Pt/Pd/SnO2/Al2O3 catalysts using tin oxalate\r\nwas conceived of and investigated. Compared to existing reference catalysts, oxalate derived\r\ncatalysts preformed favourably and can be described as equivalently active.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aldridge, James K.
