This paper presents an overview of the hypertext and knowledge based tools which have been deployed to augment existing collaborative environments, and the ontology which is used to exchange structure, promote enhanced process tracking, and aid navigation of resources before, after, and while a collaboration occurs. While the primary focus of the project has been supporting e-Science, this paper also explores the similarities and application of CoAKTinG technologies as part of a human-centred design approach to e-Learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Page, Kevin R.","Michaelides, Danius T.","Buckingham Shum, Simon J.","Chen-Burger, Yun-Heh","Dalton, Jeff","De Roure, David C.","Eisenstadt, Marc","Potter, Stephen","Shadbolt, Nigel R.","Tate, Austin","Bachler, Michelle","Komzak, Jiri"],"dc:date":"2005-11-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C Allison, S Cerri, M Gaeta, P Ritrovato and S Salerno.

Although planning is one of the oldest researched areas in Artificial Intelligence and attempts have been made in the past at developing task ontologies for planning, these formalizations suffer from serious limitations: they do not exhibit the required level of formalization and precision and they usually fail to include some of the key concepts required for specifying planning problems. In con-trast with earlier proposals, our task ontology formalizes the nature of the planning task independently of any planning paradigm, specific domains, or applications and provides a fine-grained, precise and comprehensive characterization of the space of planning problems. Finally, in addition to producing a formal specification we have also operationalized the ontology into a set of executable definitions, which provide a concrete reusable resource for knowledge acquisition and system development in planning applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rajpathak, Dr Dnyanesh","Motta, Prof Enrico"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"James Allen.

{"identifier":42362,"ep:Repository":4,"dc:type":["Conference Paper"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Formalization, User Strategy and Interaction Design: Users\u0027 Behaviour with Discourse Tagging Semantics","bibo:abstract":"When authors publish their interpretations of the ideas, opinions, claims or rebuttals in the literature, they are drawing on a repertoire of well understood moves, contributing to an extended discourse. Readers also bring their own perspective to documents, interpreting them in the light of their own research interests, and initiating, for instance, new connections that may not have been intended by authors. Collaborative, social, tagging holds promise as an approach to mediating these processes via the Web, but may lack the discourse dimension that is fundamental to the articulation of interpretations. We therefore take a hybrid semiformal approach to add structure to freeform \r\nfolksonomies. \r\n\r\nOur experience demonstrates that this particular brand of tagging requires tools designed specifically for this sensemaking task by providing enough support to initiate the annotation, while not overwhelming users with suggestions. We describe a tool called ClaimSpotter that aims at supporting this tradeoff, through a novel combination of system-initiated tag recommendations, Web interface design, and an expanded conception of how tags can be both expressed, and semantically linked. We then report a detailed study which analysed the tool’s usability and the tag structures created, contributing to our understanding of the implications of adding structure to collaborative tagging.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sereno, Bertrand","Buckingham Shum, Simon","Motta, Enrico"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":42522,"sim:weight":0.496023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.413315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.396664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.391034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.384623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.379898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.377579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.363942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9633940,"sim:weight":0.356328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.351613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.308704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12918,"sim:weight":0.29384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107683,"sim:weight":0.293679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42634,"sim:weight":0.279232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1339,"sim:weight":0.255713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12916,"sim:weight":0.252692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12915,"sim:weight":0.234989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930966,"sim:weight":0.223979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":276,"sim:weight":0.219171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112191,"sim:weight":0.21396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As manual processing by humans can be time and labour intensive, video and image processing tools can go some way to addressing such problems since they are computationally fast. However, most video analyses that utilise a combination of these tools are still done manually.

The NoA architecture\r\nfor norm-governed agents implements a computationally efficient mech-\r\nanism for identifying and indicating such problems – possible candidates\r\nfor action are assigned a specific label that contains cross-referenced in-\r\nformation of actions and norms. As actions are indicated as problematic\r\nand not simply filtered out, the agent can still choose to either act accord-\r\ning to its norms or against them. The labelling mechanism presented in\r\nthis paper is therefore a critical step towards enabling an agent to reason\r\nabout norm violations – the agent becomes norm-autonomous.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kollingbaum, M J","Norman, T J"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934435,"sim:weight":0.585995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9596,"sim:weight":0.540011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934947,"sim:weight":0.533458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932152,"sim:weight":0.528974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1440873,"sim:weight":0.500586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934939,"sim:weight":0.477613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997641,"sim:weight":0.474344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9590,"sim:weight":0.470483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933897,"sim:weight":0.327486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1510610,"sim:weight":0.326169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998147,"sim:weight":0.321473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998261,"sim:weight":0.320566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998244,"sim:weight":0.300711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998151,"sim:weight":0.295265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.294764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98829,"sim:weight":0.278185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934856,"sim:weight":0.276944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998017,"sim:weight":0.264265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573418,"sim:weight":0.254199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86745,"sim:weight":0.253975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":42368,"ep:Repository":4,"dc:type":["Journal (Paginated)"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Interpretations of Ontologies for Breast Cancer","bibo:abstract":"There are increasing efforts directed at providing\r\nformal frameworks to consolidate the widening net of terms and\r\nrelations used in medical practice. While there are many\r\nreasons for this, the need for standardisation of protocol and\r\nterminology is critical, not only for the provision of uniform levels\r\nof health care, but also to facilitate medical science research. In\r\nthe domain of breast cancer pathology, a summary of current\r\npractice by the World Health Organisation states that the\r\nvariability of the evidence archive (inconsistencies in describing\r\nmicroscopic appearances of phenomena, different diagnostic\r\nthresholds for working pathologists) is chief among the barriers\r\nto the medical understanding of the symptoms and\r\ndevelopment of early cancers. Such variability is acknowledged\r\nacross specialist fields of medicine, motivating standardisation\r\nof terminologies for reporting medical practice. The desideratum\r\nof making these standards machine-readable has led to their\r\nformalisation as ontologies.\r\nOntologies are computational artefacts designed to provide\r\nrepresentations of a domain of interest. Thus, the\r\nrepresentation must be a formal description so that it can be\r\nencoded, and reused, allowing navigation of the key concepts\r\nrecorded and retrieval of information indexed against it. This\r\nbrings the required standardisation by offering a set of labelling\r\noptions to record observations and events encountered by\r\nmedical professionals.\r\nGiven the twin goals of ontologies -- representation and\r\nstandardisation -- this paper will consider the key question of\r\ntheir design in the context of the use by experts, of information\r\nhandling applications built around them. We build on our\r\nexperience in developing ontologies for decision support\r\nsoftware in the area of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.\r\nWe will also examine, from this perspective, the suggestion\r\noffered in the literature that a set of metaphysically motivated\r\nquestions should form the basis of ontology building as\r\nguarantors of fidelity to reality.\r\nWe find that ontologies intended to support medical practice\r\ncan only be understood within the context of their intended use.\r\nThe declarative framework within which they are encoded\r\ngenerates the hope that their meaning transcends the specific\r\napplication context. We show, however, that these declarative\r\nstatements are to be understood as end products of chains of\r\nprocedural engagements between humans, materials and\r\ncommunitarian norms. It is only when this scaffolding that\r\nbrings this representation into existence becomes routine and\r\nconsensual (within the community that exchanges information\r\nindexed against it) that the concepts stand in for physiological\r\nstates with independent dynamics. However, as the state of\r\nbiomedical knowledge is always in a state of flux, and different\r\ninstitutions and practitioners may be out of sync with respect to\r\nsuch modifications, the concepts embedded in the ontologies\r\nare constantly subject to reinterpretation within the context of\r\nspecific institutional practices.\r\nGiven the fragmentation of the patient’s body when viewed\r\nthrough various specialised lenses, ontologies can provide\r\nplaceholders for co-ordinating disparate viewpoints to provide\r\nsuitable medical interventions. The extent to which such\r\ninterventions reflect any underlying reality, as manifest in\r\nmeasures of their efficacy, is closely wrapped up in the\r\nregulatory apparatus of protocol-guided consensus making.\r\nThe value of ontologies lies in their reflection of, and support\r\nfor, the sense-making activities that constitute expertise, not in\r\ntheir transparent access to a metaphysical reality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dasmahapatra, Dr Srinandan","O\u0027Hara, Dr Kieron"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"O Bodenreider and A Burgun.

The focus of this paper is the reuse of domain knowledge acquired\r\nfor an initial problem solver, with a further problem solver. For our analysis we\r\nchose a knowledge base system written in CLIPS based on the propose-andrevise\r\n(PnR) problem solver, and which had a lift/elevator knowledge base\r\n(KB). Given the nature of the problem solver, the KB contained 4 components,\r\nnamely an ontology, procedural statements which specify how the artifact, the\r\nlift, could be enhanced/modified, a set of constraints to be satisfied, and a set of\r\nfixes to be applied when constraint violations occurred. These 4 components\r\nwere first extracted manually, and were used with both an Excel spreadsheet\r\nand a constraint problem solver (ECLiPSe) to solve a range of tasks. The next\r\nphase was to implement ExtrAKTor which extracts the same 4 knowledge\r\nsources virtually automatically from the CLIPS knowledge base (held by\r\nProtégé), and transforms these so that they are usable with a number of problem\r\nsolvers. To date Excel \u0026 ECLiPSe have been selected, and again we have\r\ndemonstrated that the resulting systems are able to solve a variety of lift\r\nconfiguration tasks. This is in contrast to earlier work which produced abstract\r\nformulations of the problem but which were unable to perform reuse of actual\r\nknowledge bases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sleeman, D","Runchie, T","Gray, P"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":42626,"sim:weight":0.33352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42594,"sim:weight":0.278425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42431,"sim:weight":0.268858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.248338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42547,"sim:weight":0.244665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931821,"sim:weight":0.241415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929815,"sim:weight":0.234229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42550,"sim:weight":0.232462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934626,"sim:weight":0.224107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26701,"sim:weight":0.218124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998220,"sim:weight":0.205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998017,"sim:weight":0.202068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.176898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.158658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930973,"sim:weight":0.148686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930751,"sim:weight":0.147912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45717,"sim:weight":0.136835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.0921074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The evolving design is described against a jet engine ontology.

This is an error prone and time consuming task. It is highly desirable to relieve\r\nthe knowledge engineer of this task, and so we have developed a tool, ConEditor+\r\nthat enables domain experts themselves to capture and maintain these constraints.\r\nThe tool allows the user to combine selected entities from the domain ontology with\r\nkeywords and operators of a constraint language to form a constraint expression.\r\nFurther, we hypothesize that to apply constraints appropriately, it is necessary to understand\r\nthe context in which each constraint is applicable. We refer to this as “application\r\nconditions”. We show that an explicit representation of application conditions,\r\nin a machine interpretable format, along with the constraints and the domain\r\nontology can be used to support the verification and maintenance of constraints.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sleeman, D","Ajit, S","Fowler, D W","Knott, D"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931821,"sim:weight":0.633593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931798,"sim:weight":0.590804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000201,"sim:weight":0.573501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929227,"sim:weight":0.533196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999731,"sim:weight":0.483407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934865,"sim:weight":0.464398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42626,"sim:weight":0.378875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998300,"sim:weight":0.370174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26701,"sim:weight":0.362169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929769,"sim:weight":0.35907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931817,"sim:weight":0.34444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.341574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930565,"sim:weight":0.333603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933624,"sim:weight":0.328567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934035,"sim:weight":0.327487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934050,"sim:weight":0.320583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.250916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930751,"sim:weight":0.246266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.233777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99337,"sim:weight":0.225809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, as many non-experts have problems formulating tasks as\r\nConstraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), we have built a number of interfaces\r\nfor particular kinds of CSPs, including crypt-arithmetic problems, map-colouring\r\nproblems, and scheduling tasks, which ask highly focused questions of the user,\r\nc.f., the earlier MOLE/MORE, and SALT knowledge acquisition systems. Information\r\nfrom each of these interfaces is then transformed initially into a structured\r\nformat which is semantic web compliant and is secondly transformed into\r\nthe format required by the generic Constraint satisfaction problem solver. When\r\nthis problem solver is run, the user is either provided with solution(s) or feedback\r\nthat the problem is underspecified (when many solutions are feasible) or\r\nover-specified (when no solution is possible). Effectively the system has 3 distinct\r\nphases, namely; information capture, transformation of the information to\r\nthat suitable for the standard problem solver, and thirdly the solving and user\r\nfeedback phase.\r\nWe are planning to analyse in detail a greater range of the CSP tasks, and to\r\nproduce further UIs to support these tasks.

Such type of information is\r\napparent in many applications like multimedia processing and retrieval,\r\ninformation fusion, etc. In this paper, we propose f-SWRL, a fuzzy ex-\r\ntension to SWRL to include fuzzy assertions (such as `Mary is tall in the\r\ndegree of 0.9\u0027) and fuzzy rules (such as `being healthy is more important\r\nthan being rich to determine if one is happy\u0027).","bibo:AuthorList":["Pan, J Z","Stoilos, G","Stamou, G","Tzouvaras, V","Horrocks, I"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":42513,"sim:weight":0.615985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930368,"sim:weight":0.487883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42481,"sim:weight":0.344725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":925891,"sim:weight":0.30728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":929847,"sim:weight":0.258126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":929770,"sim:weight":0.255844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1928666,"sim:weight":0.202276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934679,"sim:weight":0.175054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99184,"sim:weight":0.174434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931322,"sim:weight":0.148465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1019011,"sim:weight":0.146355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.134583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933095,"sim:weight":0.121304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934626,"sim:weight":0.119977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930751,"sim:weight":0.119723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000257,"sim:weight":0.105701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46775,"sim:weight":0.099734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1510168,"sim:weight":0.0950278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930343,"sim:weight":0.0895452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934682,"sim:weight":0.0748454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Along with JESS, JessTab provides one method of rule-based reasoning over a Protégé ontology and knowledge base. However, once JessTab rules have been created for a knowledge base, they are explicitly tied to it as they name particular classes and slots, which greatly hinders their reuse with further knowledge bases. We have developed a two-phase process and a supporting tool to support the reuse of JessTab rule sets. The first phase involves changing the class and slot references in the rule set into an abstract reference; the second phase involves automatically mapping between the abstract rules and further knowledge bases. Once mappings have been defined and applied for all the classes and slots in the abstract rules, the new rule set can then be run against the new knowledge base. We have satisfactorily tested our tool with several ontologies and associated rule sets; moreover, some of these tests have identified possible future improvements to the tool.","bibo:AuthorList":["Corsar, D","Sleeman, D"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G Antoniou and F van Harmelen.

In this paper we describe a novel approach to ontology mapping, which is able to avoid this limitation by using background knowledge. Existing approaches relying on background knowledge typically have one or both of two key limitations: 1) they rely on a manually selected\r\nreference ontology; 2) they suffer from the noise introduced by the use of semi-structured sources, such as text corpora. Our technique circumvents these limitations by exploiting the increasing amount of semantic\r\nresources available online. As a result, there is no need either for a manually selected reference ontology (the relevant ontologies are dynamically selected from an online ontology repository), or for transforming\r\nbackground knowledge in an ontological form. The promising\r\nresults from experiments on two real life thesauri indicate both that our approach has a high precision and also that it can find mappings, which are typically missed by existing approaches.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sabou, Dr. Marta","d\u0027Aquin, Dr. Mathieu","Motta, Prof. Enrico"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Z Aleksovski, M Klein, W ten Katen and F van Harmelen.

The two\r\nessential requirements addressed are: the need to associate\r\nutility values with constraints, to reflect the relative importance\r\nof satisfying them, and the need to make statements\r\nabout which constraints are satisfied and violated by\r\na given solution. The proposal builds upon previous work\r\nin defining a Semantic Web Constraint Interchange Format\r\n(CIF), which itself builds on the proposed Semantic Web\r\nRule Language (SWRL).The main contribution of this paper\r\nis a new ontology for representing soft CSPs; we also\r\nextend the previous form of CIF/SWRL.

The proposal is motivated by the\r\nneed for a service-providing agent in a virtual organisation\r\nto reason about its commitments as soft constraints. The\r\nthree essential requirements addressed are: (1) the need to\r\nhave constraints express commitments in terms of Semantic\r\nWeb services, (2) the need to associate utility values with\r\nconstraints, to reflect the relative importance of satisfying\r\nthem, and (3) the need to make statements about which\r\nconstraints are satisfied and violated by a given solution.\r\nThe proposal builds upon previous work in defining a Semantic\r\nWeb Constraint Interchange Format (CIF), which\r\nitself builds on the proposed Semantic Web Rule Language\r\n(SWRL). The paper describes an ontology for representing\r\nsoft CSPs and their solutions, allowing an agent’s set of commitments\r\nto be expressed as a collection of soft constraints.\r\nThe ontology is an open interchange format for soft CSPs,\r\nallowing commitment to be communicated and exchanged\r\namong the members of a virtual organisation.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N Bassiliades and P Gray.

A service-provider—which may be a single\r\nagent acting within an organisation, or the VO acting as a collective whole—\r\nmanages particular resources, and commits these resources to meet specific goals.\r\nCommitments can be modelled as constraints on resources. Such constraints are\r\noften soft: they can be broken if necessary. The goal of the work described in\r\nthis paper is to create an open, reusable commitment management service (CMS)\r\nbased on Semantic Web standards. The chief requirement is that the CMS should\r\nbe reusable in different domains, able to manage commitments over services described\r\nin a wide range of domain-specific service ontologies. This paper presents\r\nopen SemanticWeb representations for (1) expressing individual commitments as\r\nconstraints over service descriptions, (2) capturing a set of commitments as a soft\r\nconstraint satisfaction problem, and (3) representing and communicating the solution\r\nto a soft CSP. A reference implementation of a constraint solver able to\r\noperate on (1) and (2) to produce (3) is described, and its reuse is demonstrated\r\nin two distinct domains: e-commerce and e-response.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N Bassiliades and P M D Gray.

In this paper, we review standard metrics for computing\r\ndistance measures and we propose a series of semantic metrics. We\r\ngive a formal account of semantic metrics drawn from a variety of\r\nresearch disciplines, and enrich them with semantics based on\r\nstandard Description Logic constructs. We argue that concept-based\r\nmetrics can be aggregated to produce numeric distances at\r\nontology-level and we speculate on the usability of our ideas\r\nthrough potential areas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hu, Dr Bo","Kalfoglou, Dr Yannis","Dupplaw, Dr David","Alani, Dr Harith","Lewis, Prof Paul","Shadbolt, Prof Nigel"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930607,"sim:weight":0.458297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":757749,"sim:weight":0.366567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934425,"sim:weight":0.354996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934682,"sim:weight":0.325704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930751,"sim:weight":0.315679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929797,"sim:weight":0.307704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931322,"sim:weight":0.302335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932706,"sim:weight":0.299401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.299324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930371,"sim:weight":0.296827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931304,"sim:weight":0.285402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1510168,"sim:weight":0.27457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934068,"sim:weight":0.256323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1505039,"sim:weight":0.240668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.225265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934547,"sim:weight":0.218704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.193607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9633940,"sim:weight":0.173764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.161521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933440,"sim:weight":0.153695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, \r\nmultiple instances of I-X Process Panels can be used as a \r\ndistributed system to coordinate the efforts of independent \r\nemergency responders as well as responders within the same \r\norganization. Furthermore, it can be used as an agent \r\nwrapper for other software systems, such as web services, to \r\nintegrate these into the emergency response team as virtual \r\nmembers. The heart of the I-X system is an automated planner \r\nthat can be used to synthesize courses of action or explore \r\nalternative options manually. \r\n\r\nIn the Co-OPR project that is currently underway the I-X \r\nframework has been used to develop a prototypical \r\napplication to support training exercises for personnel \r\nrecovery. This paper will describe some of the initial \r\nfindings that are the result of an experiment conducted to \r\nevaluate the suitability and extent to which personnel \r\nrecovery trainees and trainers can be supported by I-X in \r\nso-called “Command Post Exercises”. The result shows that an \r\nI-X application can be usefully used in such a scenario \r\neliminating some of the basic problems that often occur.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wickler, Dr Gerhard","Potter, Dr Stephen","Tate, Prof Austin"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.279855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827208,"sim:weight":0.270269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.269766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.263293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.260359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933576,"sim:weight":0.247548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.236156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930463,"sim:weight":0.235228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.202519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As the Semantic Web slowly becomes real and the amount of online semantic data increases, a new generation of tools is developed that automatically find and integrate this data. Unlike in the case of earlier tools where mapping has been performed at the design time of the tool, these new tools require mapping techniques that can be performed at run time. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we investigate the general requirements for run time mapping techniques. Second, we describe our PowerMap mapping algorithm that was designed to be used at run-time by an ontology based question answering tool.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Shvaiko and J Euzenat.

Updating an ontology that is in use may result in inconsistencies between the ontology and the knowledge base, dependent ontologies and applications/services. Current research concentrates on the creation of ontologies and how to manage ontology changes in terms of mapping ontology versions and keeping consistent with the instances. Very little work investigated on-the-fly keeping track of ontology changes while update (active ontology versioning) and using these information to control the impact on dependent applications/services, which is the aim of our research presented in this thesis. The approach we propose is to make use of ontology change logs as a check-point to analyse changed entities related to the requested services via end-user’s incoming queries (RDQL/SPARQL) and amend them as necessary to maintain the validation and continuousness of the dependent application. Firstly, We build up Log Ontology I as the concept structure to organize and construct the change information, develop our prototype system to demonstrate how the change information retrieved from Log Ontology I could be used to control the impacts brought by the ontology changes on the dependent applications and services. And then, by analysing the limitations and difficulties of our prototype system in maintaining the services related to the more complex ontology changes, we identify that the problem which fails the system facing the more complex ontology changes is the inabilities of Log Ontology I to represent complex change information in a semantic fashion. Therefore, we retract to put more focuses on Log Ontology I to enable the implementation of the mechanism to on-the-fly keep track of ontology change information, forming Log Ontology II, in order to reserve the semantics of ontology change from the beginning of ontology update process. Finally we discuss the\r\nfuture direction in terms of how the improved Log Ontology II enables the better service validation and continuousness maintenance of changing-ontology-based applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Liang, Mr. Yaozhong"],"dc:date":"2006-09-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N F Noy, S Kunnatur, M Klein and M A Musen.

Much research has been undertaken into the\r\nefficient and effective storage, access, usage and retrieval of textual information.\r\nSemantic annotation and enrichment has been proposed as a way to make textual and\r\ngraphical information available in documents for effective and efficient use. For\r\nexample, several activities focus on text annotation as a way to enrich a textual\r\ndocument, making it machine-readable and also accessible to people [1, 2, 4, 5]; other\r\nprojects focus more on annotation of images e.g. [3]. However, we believe that the\r\nseparation of text and images is artificial and there is a strong need for enabling true\r\ncross-media annotations that span the division of text and images. A constantly\r\nincreasing number of information sources, like websites, often contain both text and\r\nimages that are interrelated: usually the text in the document contains references to\r\nthe image or describes it. It is therefore crucial to develop strategies and interfaces for\r\ncross-media knowledge creation and sharing that will make these references explicit,\r\nincreasing the value of the document itself.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chakravarthy, Mr Ajay","Ciravegna, Prof Fabio","Lanfranchi, Ms Vitakeska"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Ciravegna, A Dingli, D Petrelli and Y Wilks.

This approach has utility where the user is unsure of exactly what they are looking for, but not where they have a particular information need to satisfy or a particular item to locate. Furthermore, by operating purely on a predefined database of users and items, systems using this approach represent closed worlds and offer poor scalability to new data sets. To address these limitations we propose a technique for personalizing relevance in information seeking activities, based on an understanding of how people seek information and recommendations from their social network. We then describe technical work in progress, based on Semantic Web technologies, that aims to realize this perspective.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heath, Mr Tom","Motta, Professor Enrico"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B Mobasher, R Cooley and J Srivastava.

When one wants to reuse an ontology by importing it into ontology editors, the import process is not always successful due to an ill-formed content. Many existing ontology editors provide consistency detection by connecting to a reasoner, and highlighting the inconsistencies. However, no explanation nor functionalities are provided for users to correct the\r\nproblems. In this paper we introduce a graph-based approach to checking ontology inconsistencies, implemented in our tool, ReTAX++. The system not only highlights the inconsistencies in an ontology by interacting with a reasoner, but also provides facilities for users to resolve the problems. By formalising an ontology as a graph, we check which relationships of the inconsistent concepts may cause the contradiction, and a number of options to resolve the problems are provided. Currently, we only focus on disjointedness and complement contradictions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lam, Sik Chun (Joey)","Sleeman, Derek","Vasconcelos, Wanberto"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Rogers J Knublauch H Stevens R Wang A L Rector, N Horridge and C Wroe.

Along with JESS, JessTab provides one method of rule based reasoning over a Protégé ontology and knowledge base. However once JessTab rules have been created for a knowledge base, they are explicitly tied to it as they name particular classes and slots, which greatly hinders their reuse with further knowledge bases. We have developed a two phase process and a supporting tool to support the reuse of JessTab rule sets.  The first phase involves changing the class and slot references in the rule set into an abstract reference; the second phase involves automatically mapping between the abstract rules and further knowledge bases.

Particular attention is given to the challenge of negotiating the overheads of capturing this form of rationale. Our approach has maintained a strong emphasis on keeping the representational scheme as simple as possible to enable real time meeting mediation and capture, attending explicitly to the skills required to use the approach well, particularly for the sort of participatory, multi-stakeholder requirements analysis demanded by many design problems. However, we can then specialize the notation and the way in which the tool is used in the service of specific methodologies, supported by a customizable hypermedia environment, and interoperable with other software tools. After presenting this approach, called Compendium, we present examples to illustrate the capabilities for support security argumentation in requirements engineering, template driven modeling for document generation, and IBIS-based indexing of and navigation around video records of meetings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buckingham Shum, Dr S","Selvin, A","Sierhuis, Dr M","Conklin, Dr J","Haley, C","Nuseibeh, Prof B"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Antón AI and C Potts.

Currently, to capture the constraint information, a domain expert (design engineer) has to work with a knowledge engineer to identify the constraints, and it is then the task of the knowledge engineer to encode these into the workbench’s knowledge base (KB). This is an error prone and time-consuming task. It is highly desirable to relieve the knowledge engineer of this task, and so we have developed a tool, ConEditor that enables domain experts themselves to capture and maintain these constraints. The tool allows the user to combine selected entities from the domain ontology with keywords and op-erators of a constraint language to form a constraint expression. However we hypothesize that to apply constraints appropriately, it is necessary to understand the context in which each constraint is applicable. We refer to this as “applica-tion conditions”. We plan to make these application conditions machine inter-pretable and investigate how they, together with a domain ontology, can be used to support the verification and maintenance of constraints.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Ajit, D Sleeman, DW Fowler and D Knott.

Although, some attempts have been made in the past at developing the libraries of scheduling problem-solvers, these only provide limited coverage. Many lack generality, as they subscribe to a particular scheduling domain. Others simply implement a particular problem-solving technique, which may be applicable only to a subset of the space of scheduling problems. In addition, most of these libraries fail to provide the required degree of depth and precision. In our approach we subscribe to the Task-Method-Domain-Application knowledge modeling framework which provides a structured organization for the different components of the library. At the task level, we construct a generic scheduling task ontology to formalize the space of scheduling problems. At the method level, we construct a generic problem-solving model of scheduling that generalizes from the variety of approaches to scheduling problem-solving, which can be found in the literature. The generic nature of this model is demonstrated by constructing seven methods for scheduling, as alternative specialization of the model. Finally, we validated our library on a number of applications to demonstrate its generic nature and effective support for developing scheduling applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rajpathak, Dr Dnyanesh","Motta, Prof Enrico","Zdrahal, Dr Zdenek","Roy, Prof Rajkumar"],"dc:date":"2006-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8827173,"sim:weight":0.507528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98526,"sim:weight":0.37267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68672,"sim:weight":0.184817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998017,"sim:weight":0.173859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998220,"sim:weight":0.172101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.148407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997469,"sim:weight":0.146252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.135786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930371,"sim:weight":0.130345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.118501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26701,"sim:weight":0.113621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932706,"sim:weight":0.103922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It deals with the temporally-bound assignment of jobs to resources. Although scheduling has been extensively researched in the AI community for the past 30 years, efforts have primarily focused on specific applications, algorithms, or \u0027scheduling shells\u0027 and no comprehensive analysis exists on the nature of scheduling problems, which provides a formal account of what scheduling is, independently of the way scheduling problems can be approached. Research on KBS development by reuse makes use of ontologies, to provide knowledge-level specifications of reusable KBS components. In this paper we describe a task ontology, which formally characterises the nature of scheduling problems, independently of particular application domains and in-dependently of how the problems can be solved. Our results provide a comprehensive, domain-independent and formally specified refer-ence model for scheduling applications. This can be used as the ba-sis for further analyses of the class of scheduling problems and also as a concrete reusable resource to support knowledge acquisition and system development in scheduling applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Motta, Prof Enrico","Rajpathak, Dr Dnyanesh","Zdrahal, Dr Zdenek","Roy, Dr Rajkumar"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Motta.

Although, some attempts have been made in the past at developing libraries of scheduling methods, these only provide limited coverage: in some cases they are specific to a particular scheduling domain; in other cases they simply implement a particular scheduling technique; in other cases they fail to provide the required degree of depth and precision. Our library is based on a structured approach, whereby we first develop a scheduling task ontology, and then construct a task-specific but domain independent model of scheduling problem-solving, which generalises from specific approaches to scheduling problem-solving. Different PSMs are then constructed uniformly by specialising the generic model of scheduling problem-solving. Our library has been evaluated on a number of real-life and benchmark applications to demonstrate its generic and comprehensive nature.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rajpathak, Dr Dnyanesh","Motta, Prof Enrico","Zdrahal, Dr Zdenek","Roy, Dr Rajkumar"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"V R Benjamins.

We argue that associations between terms in a search query can reveal the underlying information needs in the users\u0027 mind and should be taken into account in search. We propose a multi-faceted approach to detect and exploit such associations. The CORDER method measures the association strength between query terms, and queries consisting of terms having low association strength with each other are seen as \u0027vague queries\u0027. For a vague query, we use WordNet to find related terms of the query terms to compose extended queries, relying especially on the role of least common subsumers (LCS).

We argue that associations between terms in a search query can reveal the underlying information needs in the users\u0027 mind and should be taken into account in search. We propose a multi-faceted approach to detect and exploit such associations. The CORDER method measures the association strength between query terms, and queries consisting of terms having low association strength with each other are seen as \u0027vague queries\u0027. For a vague query, we use WordNet to find related terms of the query terms to compose extended queries, relying especially on the role of least common subsumers (LCS). We use relation strength between terms calculated by the CORDER method to refine these extended queries. Finally, we use the Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) model and information flow (IF) method to expand these refined queries.

Negotiation processes are at the core of the inter-operable e-Business. While research on negotiation is not new, the vast majority of the studies to date have been based on the multi-agent platform. However, it is very common that negotiation processes are interleaved with other business processes that are automated normally by a workflow system. Therefore, the inter-operability with other internal- and external-systems is critical in such case, which may require extra efforts on the integration issues.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose an approach for building a workflow system with negotiation processes incorporating the BPEL4WS,\r\na standard for building and managing web service based business processes, on a multi-agent platform in a pure distributed manner. By adapting our approach, negotiation process can be involved in the BPEL4WS process and deployed seamlessly. The existing work on negotiation based on multi-agent system also can be adapted directly with our approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guo, Mr. Li","Chen-Burger, Dr. Yun-Huh (jessica)","Robertson, Dr. Dave"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":617358,"sim:weight":0.319325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":691445,"sim:weight":0.311242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931029,"sim:weight":0.285825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827052,"sim:weight":0.278056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47237,"sim:weight":0.269332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":756783,"sim:weight":0.264084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1075496,"sim:weight":0.23913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46163,"sim:weight":0.237673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930718,"sim:weight":0.221206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998042,"sim:weight":0.207072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932989,"sim:weight":0.194542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934670,"sim:weight":0.190479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934231,"sim:weight":0.184716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386931,"sim:weight":0.156095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24070,"sim:weight":0.154458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45128,"sim:weight":0.149336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":649699,"sim:weight":0.129209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933440,"sim:weight":0.125447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929226,"sim:weight":0.0903875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103811,"sim:weight":0.0516941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In order to allow the task to be achieved effec-tively, the instructions on how to realize transformation should be well specified, preferably in a declarative and re-usable format, thus allowing the construction of robust tools which on the one hand assist users to generate and maintain mappings at design time and on the other hand perform semantic data transformation at run time. Furthermore, the transformation instructions should not only allow the gen-eration of semantic data objects but also allow the creation of rich semantic relations between them. In this context, we developed a comprehensive instance mapping ontology. One distinctive feature of the instance mapping ontology is that it provides comprehensive support for the specification of complex mappings. Another feature is that the instance mapping ontology is representation independent, which does not limit itself to data sources in particular representa-tions. This ontology has been applied in generating a se-mantic layer for the web site of the Knowledge Media Insti-tute (KMi) at the Open University.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lei, Dr. Yuangui"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Berners-Lee, J Hendler and O Lassila.

As such it is important to ensure that i) high quality metadata are extracted from heterogeneous sources in an automated manner and ii) comprehensive querying facilities are provided thus nabling\r\nknowledge to be accessed as easily as possible. However, current semantic web portals have only marginally addressed these issues. In this paper, we present our work, the KMi semantic web portal infrastructure, which pays special attention to these issues. Central to our infrastructure are three components: i) an automated\r\nmetadata extraction tool, ASDI, which supports the extraction of high quality metadata from heterogeneous sources, ii) an ontology-driven question answering tool, AquaLog, which makes use of the domain specific ontology and the semantic metadata extracted by ASDI to answers questions in natural language format, and iii) a semantic search engine, which enhances traditional text-based searching by making use of the underlying ontologies and\r\nthe extracted metadata. A semantic web portal application has been built, which illustrates the usage of this infrastructure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lei, Dr. Yuangui","Lopez, Miss Vanessa","Motta, Prof. Enrico"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Berners-Lee, J Hendler and O Lassila.

They can support various information system processes, particularly information acquisition and integration. Ontologies themselves need to be designed, built and maintained. An important part of the ontology engineering cycle is the ability to keep a handcrafted ontology up to date. Therefore, we have developed a tool called MnM that helps during the ontology maintenance process. MnM extracts information from texts and populates an ontology. It uses NLP (Natural Language Processing), Information Extraction and Machine Learning technologies. In particular, MnM was tested using an electronic newsletter consisting of news articles describing events happening in the Knowledge Media Institute (KMi).  MnM could constitute an important part of an ontology-driven information system, with its integrated web-based ontology editor and provision of open APIs to link to ontology servers and to integrate with information extraction tools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vargas-Vera, Dr Maria","Moreale, Miss Emanuela","Stutt, Dr Arthur","Motta, Dr Enrico","Ciravegna, Dr Fabio"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":960776,"sim:weight":0.515922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934807,"sim:weight":0.444544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929815,"sim:weight":0.4055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929779,"sim:weight":0.399912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.38997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42669,"sim:weight":0.378034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930507,"sim:weight":0.366569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930488,"sim:weight":0.333614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934004,"sim:weight":0.328691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930751,"sim:weight":0.286398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930343,"sim:weight":0.26855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27349,"sim:weight":0.263927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997872,"sim:weight":0.244902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.22609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.221823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827169,"sim:weight":0.209453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934626,"sim:weight":0.208345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9633940,"sim:weight":0.138591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.112919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":377090,"sim:weight":0.0679342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Having analysed their complexity in light of the kinds of logic that may be used in an automatic argumentation extraction system, the main characteristic of these patterns appears to be the polymorphism of the pattern variables. Therefore, systems that learn patterns automatically ought to be able to generate many-sorted logic formulae, so that polymorphic types may be associated to the extraction slots (or – equivalently – to a Logic Formulae). An analysis of existing (pattern learning) systems was carried out to gauge the possibility of using them within our framework. However, we concluded that none of the existing systems can handle our requirements. Finally, we present our vision of an agent-based student portal as the front-end of a system that can locate argumentation links in a student essay and integrates with related educational services.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vargas-Vera, Dr Maria","Moreale, Miss Emanuela"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1510610,"sim:weight":0.244481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933897,"sim:weight":0.242367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48421,"sim:weight":0.221745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26701,"sim:weight":0.19111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98772,"sim:weight":0.179309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384111,"sim:weight":0.177347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.17187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.164737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932725,"sim:weight":0.146267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.143651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98750,"sim:weight":0.128901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.121152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9633940,"sim:weight":0.077423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The latter can be seen as a description of an agent\u0027s intentions, which can be shared and communicated amongst multiple I-X agents to coordinate activities in an emergency response scenario. In general, an \u003cI-N-C-A\u003e object describes the product of a synthesis task. In the multi-agent context it can be used to describe the intentions of an agent, although it also includes elements of beliefs about the world and goals to be achieved, thus showing a close relationship with the BDI agent model which we will explore in this paper. From a user\u0027s perspective, I-X Process Panels can be used as an intelligent to-do list that assists emergency responders in applying pre-defined standard operating procedures in different types of emergencies. In particular, multiple instances of the I-X Process Panels can be used as a distributed system to coordinate the efforts of independent emergency responders as well as responders within the same organization. Furthermore, it can be used as an agent wrapper for other software systems such as web-services to integrate these into the emergency response team as virtual members. At the heart of I-X is a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner that can be used to synthesize courses of action automatically or explore alternative options manually.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wickler, Dr Gerhard","Tate, Prof Austin","Potter, Dr Stephen"],"dc:date":"2006-05-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8998017,"sim:weight":0.367137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25806,"sim:weight":0.359491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98829,"sim:weight":0.343871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998328,"sim:weight":0.316067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930564,"sim:weight":0.308346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26006,"sim:weight":0.272672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.233714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42596,"sim:weight":0.233613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44505,"sim:weight":0.225399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934626,"sim:weight":0.216218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.210817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.208404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46712,"sim:weight":0.191881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.183144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933440,"sim:weight":0.169591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To relate or draw conclusions from data so indexed, anatomy ontologies must be equipped with the formal vocabulary that would allow statements about meronomy to be qualified by constraints such as part of the male or part at the embryonic stage. Lacking such a vocabulary, anatomists have built this information into the structure of the ontology or into anatomical terms. For example, in the FlyBase anatomy for drosophila, the term larval abdominal segment encodes the stage in the term, while the terms male genital disc and female genital disc encode the sex. It remains implicit that a fly has one and only one of these parts during its larval stage. Such indicators of context can and should be represented explicitly in the ontology.\r\n\r\nResults: The framework we have defined for anatomical ontologies allows the canonical anatomy structures of a given species to be those common to all sexes, and to have either male, female or hermaphrodite parts—but not combinations of the latter. Temporal aspects of development are addressed by associating a stage with organism parts and requiring a connected anatomy to have parts that exist at a common stage. Both sex and anatomical stage are represented by attributes. This formalization clarifies ontological structure and meaning and increases the capacity for formal reasoning about anatomy. The framework also supports generalizations such as vertebrate and invertebrate, thereby allowing the representation of anatomical structures that are common across a sub-phylum.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aitken, Stuart"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":42533,"sim:weight":0.326631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44304,"sim:weight":0.301694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930371,"sim:weight":0.279704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934682,"sim:weight":0.24616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108071,"sim:weight":0.230575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932076,"sim:weight":0.214102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85444,"sim:weight":0.212468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930343,"sim:weight":0.198958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931322,"sim:weight":0.198133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383350,"sim:weight":0.195339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.174551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.161113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.155705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381931,"sim:weight":0.140851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The leukemia dataset of Golub et al. [1] and the NCI60 dataset of Ross et al. [2] present multiclass classification problems where three tumour types and nine cell lines respectively must be identified. We apply an evolutionary algorithm to identify the near-optimal set of predictive genes that classify the data. We also examine the initial gene selection step whereby the most informative genes are selected from the genes assayed.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nIn the absence of feature selection, classification accuracy on the training data is typically good, but not replicated on the testing data. Gene selection using the RankGene software [3] is shown to significantly improve performance on the testing data. Further, we show that the choice of feature selection criteria can have a significant effect on accuracy. The evolutionary algorithm is shown to perform stably across the space of possible parameter settings – indicating the robustness of the approach. We assess performance using a low variance estimation technique, and present an analysis of the genes most often selected as predictors.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe computational methods we have developed perform robustly and accurately, and yield results in accord with clinical knowledge: A Z-score analysis of the genes most frequently selected identifies genes known to discriminate AML and Pre-T ALL leukemia. This study also confirms that significantly different sets of genes are found to be most discriminatory as the sample classes are refined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jirapech-Umpai, Thanyaluk","Aitken, Stuart"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1009638,"sim:weight":0.467135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1117342,"sim:weight":0.446129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1116743,"sim:weight":0.432815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26334,"sim:weight":0.418372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1054803,"sim:weight":0.413167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":649695,"sim:weight":0.410283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1020450,"sim:weight":0.399928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":729167,"sim:weight":0.382661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24013,"sim:weight":0.379976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":766518,"sim:weight":0.373076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":899733,"sim:weight":0.367074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":617539,"sim:weight":0.360305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":938725,"sim:weight":0.328925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48455,"sim:weight":0.311797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98644,"sim:weight":0.311041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46879,"sim:weight":0.301408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383664,"sim:weight":0.270354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383911,"sim:weight":0.243659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99378,"sim:weight":0.242883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24014,"sim:weight":0.241056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Specifically, the availability of distributed semantic markup on a large scale opens the way to QA systems which can make use of such semantic information to provide precise, formally derived answers to questions. At the same time the distributed, heterogeneous, large-scale nature of the semantic information introduces significant challenges. In this paper we describe the design of a QA system, PowerAqua, designed to exploit semantic markup on the web to provide answers to questions posed in natural language. PowerAqua does not assume that the user has any prior information about the semantic resources. The system takes as input a natural language query, translates it into a set of logical queries, which are then answered by consulting and aggregating information derived from multiple heterogeneous semantic sources.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J T Dullea, P Clark, S Sripada and T Barrett.

This resulted in an abundance of prototype \r\nsystems and discussion most of which are centred around the underlying infrastructure. \r\nHowever, when we critically review the work done to date we realise that there is little \r\ndiscussion with respect to the vision of the Semantic Web. In particular, there is an \r\nobserved dearth of discussion on how to deliver knowledge sharing in an environment such \r\nas the Semantic Web in effective and efficient manners. There are a lot of overlooked issues, \r\nassociated with agents and trust to hidden assumptions made with respect to knowledge \r\nrepresentation and robust reasoning in a distributed environment. These issues could \r\npotentially hinder further development if not considered at the early stages of designing \r\nSemantic Web systems. In this perspectives paper, we aim to help engineers and practitioners \r\nof the Semantic Web by raising awareness of these issues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kalfoglou, Dr Yannis","Alani, Dr Harith","Schorlemmer, Dr Marco","Walton, Dr Chris"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"Y Kalfoglou, H Alani, M Schorlemmer and C Walton.

Specifically, the availability of distributed semantic markup on a large scale opens the way to QA systems which can make use of such semantic information to provide precise, formally derived answers to questions. At the same time the distributed, heterogeneous, large-scale nature of the semantic information introduces significant challenges. In this paper we describe the design of a QA system, PowerAqua, designed to exploit semantic markup on the web to provide answers to questions posed in natural language. PowerAqua does not assume that the user has any prior information about the semantic resources. The system takes as input a natural language query, translates it into a set of logical queries, which are then answered by consulting and aggregating information derived from multiple heterogeneous semantic sources.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J T Dullea, P Clark, S Sripada and T Barrett.

AquaLog is a portable question-answering system which takes queries expressed in natural language and an ontology as input and returns answers drawn from the available semantic markup.  We say that AquaLog is portable, because the configuration time required to customize the system for a particular ontology is negligible. AquaLog combines several powerful techniques in a novel way to make sense of NL queries and to map them to semantic markup.  Moreover it also in-cludes a learning component, which ensures that the performance of the system im-proves over time, in response to the particular community jargon used by the end users.  In this paper we describe the current version of the system, in particular dis-cussing its portability, its reasoning capabilities, and its learning mechanism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lopez, Vanessa","Motta, Prof Enrico","Pasin, Michele"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Berners-Lee, J Hendler and O Lassila.

The successful convergence of multiple ontologies and referencing schemes is key. This is hampered by a lack of any means for managing and communicating co-references. We have therefore developed an ontology and framework for the exploration and resolution of potential co-references, in the semantic web at large, that allow the user to a) discover and record uniquely identifying attributes b) interface candidates with and create pipelines of other systems for reference management c) record identified duplicates in a usable and retrievable manner, and d) provide a consistent reference service for accessing them.

Taking greater account of a user’s context is also discussed as an essential component in better supporting performance of tasks online. Finally we consider how Semantic Web technologies can support the development of task-focused context-aware tools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heath, Mr Tom","Dzbor, Dr Martin","Motta, Professor Enrico"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Guha, R McCool and Miller.

This paper considers the nature of citation, the arguments for and against the current approach to impact measurement based on citation count and proposed alternative measures. It is argued that most proposed alternatives are attempting to do the same thing: apply a value-based approach to the impact measurement, more subtle than purely counting citations. Parallels are drawn with psychology research and in particular the emerging field of Semiometrie, and it is argued that applying the semiometric approach to the area of citation analysis and im-pact measurement provides not only a method to unify the proposed alterna-tives, but suggests a future scenario of research measurement and impact analy-sis far richer than has previously been considered possible.","bibo:AuthorList":["McRae-Spencer, Mr D M","Shadbolt, Prof N R"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Garfield.

It is based on supervised learning, learns extraction rules from\r\nannotated text and then applies those rules on new articles to populate the ontology. Hence, the system classifies stories and populates a hand-crafted ontology with new instances. It is based on three components: Marmot - a natural language processor; Crystal - a dictionary\r\ninduction tool; and Badger - an information extraction tool. A part of the entire cycle is a user who accepts, rejects or modifies extracted and suggested instances to be populated.\r\nA description of experiments performed with a text corpus consisting of 91 articles is given. The results complete the paper and support the hypothesis that assigning a rule confidence value to each extraction rule improves the performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Celjuska, Mr David","Vargas-Vera, Dr Maria"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D CELJUSKA.

A novel approach is presented how specialized agents with partial local knowledge of the particular domain achieve ontology mapping without creating global or reference ontology. Our approach is particularly fit for a query-answering scenario, where answer needs to be created in real time to satisfy a query posed by the user.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nagy, Mr Miklos","Vargas-Vera, Dr Maria","Motta, Dr Enrico"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Bayardo.

At\r\nvarious times, philosophers have wondered whether the present\r\nKing of France is bald or whether existence is a predicate. Just as\r\nscientists have grappled with the reality of negative numbers,\r\nsubatomic particles, or the vital force, so have theologians and\r\nmystics grappled with the reality of God and inner spiritual\r\nexperiences. The nature of knowledge is an abiding question\r\nand has resulted in people’s continuous attempts to find ways to\r\nexpress, word, or convey their own “knowledge.” Physics and\r\nmathematics depend on specific symbolic languages, and many\r\napproaches to AI regard finding the problem’s optimal representation\r\nas most of the solution.\r\nRecently, we have seen an explosion of interest in ontologies\r\nas artifacts to represent human knowledge and as critical\r\ncomponents in knowledge management, the Semantic Web,\r\nbusiness-to-business applications, and several other application\r\nareas. Various research communities commonly assume that\r\nontologies are the appropriate modeling structure for representing\r\nknowledge. However, little discussion has occurred\r\nregarding the actual range of knowledge an ontology can successfully\r\nrepresent.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Hara, Dr. Kieron","Brewster, Mr. Christopher"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K E Weick.

A prereq-\r\nuisite for the SW is the availability of structured\r\nknowledge, so methods need to be employed to gen-\r\nerate it from existing unstructured content (docu-\r\nment annotation).\r\nA number of tools have been proposed for manual\r\nannotation of documents, some of them use Information Extraction, IE, to re-\r\nduce the burden on the user side. Relying on a man-\r\nual process presents some risks for the SW, because\r\nit creates a bottleneck: convincing millions of users\r\nto annotate documents requires a world-wide action\r\nof unlikely outcome. Moreover there are some se-\r\nrious concerns about the quality of manual annota-\r\ntion, due to user inability or to spamming. To produce a viable\r\nand maintainable SW, large scale automatic anno-\r\ntation services, similar to today\u0027s\r\nsearch engines, are needed. They must be: (1) easily\r\ndefined for a specific ontological component or ser-\r\nvice; (2) able to constantly re-index documents (so\r\nto solve problem of obsolete/misaligned annotation).\r\nMachine Learning, ML, and IE become then in-\r\ndispensable for developing SW tools able to extract\r\nand structure information: in this paper we focus on\r\nidentifying requirements an challenges for future re-\r\nsearch in ML and IE applied to SW. When detailing\r\nthe requirements and challenge we refer, as an ex-\r\nample, to Armadillo. Armadillo\r\nis a tool for extracting and integrating information\r\nfrom large repositories (e.g. the Web) developed at\r\nShe±eld. Armadillo is able to (1) learn to extract\r\nfacts and entities in a largely unsupervised way; (2)\r\ncope with unstructured documents such as semi-\r\nstructured and free documents as well. The learn-\r\ning algorythm currently integrated into Armadillo\r\nis (LP)2, implemented in Amilcare. The requirements and challenges that\r\nwe identify, however, are not related simply to Ar-\r\nmadillo but can be shared by other SW tools with\r\nsimilar aims.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Fabio Ciravegna and Daniela Petrelli.

Most of the current tech-\r\nnologies available for creating structured content is\r\nbased on static human centred annotation, very of-\r\nten completely manual, of documents.\r\nManual annotation is time-consuming and can in-\r\ntroduce noise, being incom-\r\nplete or incorrect, hence decreasing the quality of the\r\ninformation. For these reasons, we believe that the\r\nSW needs automatic methods for annotating con-\r\ntent. Automatic annotation services such as Sem-\r\nTag and Armadillo intend to solve this problem by automatically\r\nproviding SW content.\r\nIn this paper we describe the Armadillo approach\r\nto automatic annotation and detail the methods em-\r\nployed internally for integrating and ensuring consis-\r\ntency of elicited knowledge. Armadillo is a tool for\r\nextracting and integrating information from large\r\nrepositories (e.g. the Web) developed at Sheffield.\r\nThe methodology employed for validating and inte-\r\ngrating the information is a series of weak eviden-\r\ntial similarity tests, implemented through a library\r\nof String Metrics. The paper focuses on presenting the Armadillo tool and\r\ndetails a use case, relating the methodologies used.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Fabio Ciravegna and Yorick Wilks.

The Semantic Web (SWeb\r\nin the following) with its layers of annotations can increase\r\nthe cognitive overload when a document is accessed. As a\r\nmatter of fact, in a SWeb framework, annotations can be\r\nadded at different stages in a document lifetime. Initially\r\nannotations are added at editing time by the author [11]\r\n[12] [13]. Annotations can span from tagging portions of\r\ndocuments with concept labels, to identifying instances or\r\nconcept mentions, to connect information (e.g. a telephone\r\nnumber and its owner). Different users can annotate the\r\nsame document in different ways, e.g. using different\r\nontologies, creating different views of the same document.\r\nOther annotations can be composed at reading time, i.e.\r\nwhen the document is displayed, for example added by\r\nautomatic semantic harvesters that extract and integrate\r\ninformation from different repositories [14] [15], or\r\nsystems which link entities to additional information or\r\nservices [4].\r\nThe many times a document can be annotated and the many\r\npieces of knowledge potentially connected can easily\r\ntransform a SWeb document into an intricate set of\r\nconnections. Moreover, the semantic consistence of the\r\nannotations (e.g. outgoing links) cannot be guaranteed\r\nwhen different heterogeneous schemas can be applied to\r\nthe same document. For example, from the author of a\r\ndocument it would be possible to add a hyperlink to reach\r\nher diary; from her contact address it is possible to reach\r\nthe weather forecast for that region. Though both\r\nannotations are perfectly acceptable in principle, it is likely\r\nthat such different navigation choices would distract and\r\ndisorient the user.\r\nThis paper proposes to organize the annotations into layers\r\nto offer functionalities specific to the user and the context\r\nof use as a way to limit the cognitive overload. Managing\r\nlayers of annotations requires the document to be active.\r\nAn active document is aware of its own content and can\r\nflexibly change the way it presents itself to the actual user,\r\ne.g. by allowing the user to read only up to a predefined\r\nlevel of detail. However an active document should not be\r\nlimited to the presentation phase: we extend the activity to\r\nthe annotation layer as well. A global framework for\r\nediting and accessing multi-layered semantically active\r\ndocuments is proposed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lanfranchi, Dr. Vita","Ciravegna, Prof. Fabio","Petrelli, Dr. Daniella"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Bompani, P Ciancarini and F Vitali.

That study analysed total duration for which patients had, for example, raised Intracranial Pressure, but it did not consider temporal relationships between various physiological and clinical events.  In this study, we have addressed that issue in a number of ways.  Firstly, by using a workbench, AAB, to display the Real Time data-set and asking clinicians to make predictions of expected outcome based on complete physiological and clinical data. Secondly, repeating the exercise with a reduced (more compact) representation for the physiological data. Thirdly, patterns were generated, including “adjacent” physiological parameters and clinicians were asked if they are likely/very unlikely to cause a particular major physiological event or outcome.  Finally, we implemented a module to test patterns of the form:\r\n\r\nIF X happens then Y will happen between T1-T2\r\n\r\nagainst patient time-series data.  Results of all these studies have so far not been conclusive [2]; it has been suggested that the brain is currently not very well understood physiologically, and that a similar set of analyses should be applied to a simpler organ.  Given that significant amounts of data are now available for patients undergoing dialysis, we have chosen to do an analogous study in this area; also the physiology of the renal system is much better understood.  We have outlined some additional studies we plan to undertake using data-mining, theory refinement and knowledge base refinement approaches.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sleeman, D","Luo, Z","Christie, G","Coghill, G"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A McQuatt, P J D Andrews, D Sleeman, V Corruble and P A Jones.

Additionally, besides having to design a part of an artifact to be consistent with the specification, it must also be consistent with the company\u0027s design standards. The Designers\u0027 Workbench supports designers by checking that their configurations satisfy both physical and organisational constraints. The system uses an ontology to describe the available elements in a configuration task. Configurations are composed of features, which can be geometric or nongeometric, physical or abstract. Designers can select a class of feature (e.g. Bolt) from the ontology, and add an instance of that class (e.g. a particular bolt) to their configuration. Properties of the instance can express the parameters of the feature (e.g. the size of the bolt), and also describe connections to other features (e.g. what parts the bolt is used to hold together).","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Bowen, P O\u0027Grady and L Smith.

Further, a set of refinement operators are used to guarantee the consistency of the resulting taxonomy. ReTAX+ is a system which provides the user with additional functionalities as they build a new taxonomy or reuse an existing taxonomy. Specifically, it provides functions to enable a user to add, edit or delete the values associated with class attributes; additionally, it provides functions to add a class, delete a class, merge two classes, and split a class. Again consistent with the philosophy of ReTAX, ReTAX+ offers the user, when relevant, a number of options to achieve his objectives. For example, deleting a class is a fairly radical step and various decisions need to be made about the resulting “orphaned” instances and sub-classes.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Alberdi and D Sleeman.

Its purpose is to promote discussion and provide a foundation for forming mapping consensus between Compendium and IX. This document first describes mapping principles. These principles are used in and demonstrated by a concrete example that is based on a larger Compendium map provided by Simon Buckingham-Shum, KMI OU. As understood, a new version of IX Process Panel will be produced. In addition to the existing Issue, Activity and Constraint sub-panels, the new IX Process Panel will also have an Annotation sub-panel. Although these changes will largely not affect its conceptual mapping to Compendium, the presentation of the mapping results will be reflected in an IX Panel.

This system, called Mobile Agents (MA), is voice controlled and provides information verbally to the astronauts through programs called \"personal agents.\" The system partly automates the role of CapCom in Apollo-including monitoring and managing EVA navigation, scheduling, equipment deployment, telemetry, health tracking, and scientific data collection. EVA data are stored automatically in a shared database in the habitat/vehicle and mirrored to a site accessible by a remote science team. The program has been developed iteratively in the context of use, including six years of ethnographic observation of field geology. Our approach is to develop automation that supports the human work practices, allowing people to do what they do well, and to work in ways they are most familiar. Field experiments in Utah have enabled empirically discovering requirements and testing alternative technologies and protocols. This paper reports on the 2004 system configuration, experiments, and results, in which an EVA robotic assistant (ERA) followed geologists approximately 150 m through a winding, narrow canyon. On voice command, the ERA took photographs and panoramas and was directed to move and wait in various locations to serve as a relay on the wireless network. The MA system is applicable to many space work situations that involve creating and navigating from maps (including configuring equipment for local topology), interacting with piloted and unpiloted rovers, adapting to environmental conditions, and remote team collaboration involving people and robots.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clancey, W.J.","Sierhuis, M.","Alena, R.","Berrios, D.","Dowding, J.","Graham, J.S.","Tyree, K.S","Hirsh, R.L.","Garry, W.B.","Semple, A.","Buckingham Shum, S.J.","Shadbolt, N.","Rupert, S.M."],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E 1Alonso and “AI.

Current research on trust seems to focus on developing\r\ncomputational models, semantic representations, inference techniques, etc.\r\nHowever, little attention has been given to the plausible trust strategies or tactics that\r\nan agent can follow when interacting with other agents on the Semantic Web. In this\r\npaper we identify five most common strategies of trust and discuss their envisaged\r\ncosts and benefits. The aim is to provide some guidelines to help system developers\r\nappreciate the risks and gains involved with each trust strategy.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Hara, Kieron","Alani, Harith","Kalfoglou, Yannis","Shadbolt, Nigel"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H Alani, S Dasmahapatra, K O’Hara and N Shadbolt.

Its process model is a typical type of web service model that might be used to express a business process model and could be processed by an agent automatically. Furthermore, OWL-S promises to provide semantics for web services. However,\r\nOWL-S is an XML based syntax that is hard to use for those with little XML knowledge, which presents obstacles\r\nat requirements capture and design stages. In contrast, diagram based business process modelling languages like\r\nFBPML include standard process constructs familiar to this target user group. Such methods are semantically richer than an OWL-S styled modelling language, but do not\r\nprovide direct inputs for web service development and cannot be used by agent systems straightforwardly. In order to bridge this gap, automatic translation from diagram based business process models to web services\r\nmodels is necessary. In this paper, we have provided such a translation by applying conceptual mapping techniques,\r\ndemonstrated by using concrete mapping examples from\r\nFBPML notations to the OWL-S process ontology. We also have implemented a system which translates FBPML models to OWL-S process models automatically according to our conceptual mapping principles. Model constructs that cannot easily be expressed using OWL-S are also identified.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guo, Mr. Li","Chen-Burger, Dr. Yun-Heh","Robertson, Dr. Dave"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Tony Andrews, Francisco Curbera, Hitesh Dholakia, Yaron Goland, Johannes Klein, Frank Leymann, Kevin Liu, Dieter Roller and Doug Smith.

Ad-hoc rapid prototyping easily leads to unsatisfactory results, e.g. poor maintainability and extensibility. However, existing web design frameworks focus exclusively on data presentation: the development of specific functionalities is still achieved through low-level programming. In this paper we address this issue by describing our work on the integration of (semantic) web services into a web design framework, OntoWeaver. The resulting architecture, OntoWeaver-S, supports rapid prototyping of service-centred data-intensive web sites, which allow access to remote web services. In particular, OntoWeaver-S is integrated with a comprehensive web service platform, IRS-II, for the specification, discovery, and execution of web services. Moreover, it employs a set of comprehensive site ontologies to model and represent all aspects of service-centred data-intensive web sites, and thus is able to offer high level support for the design and development process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lei, Ms Y","Motta, Prof E","Domingue, Dr J"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Ankolekar, M Burstein, J Hobbs, O Lassila, D Martin, D McDermott, S McIlraith, S Narayanan, M Paolucci, T Payne and K Sycara.

An important aspect of Magpie, which differentiates it from superficially similar hypermedia systems, is that the association between items on a web page and semantic concepts is not merely a mechanism for dynamic linking, but it is the enabling condition for locating services and making them available to a user. These services can be manually activated by a user (pull services), or opportunistically triggered when the appropriate web entities are encountered during a browsing session (push services). In this paper we analyze Magpie from the perspective of building semantic web applications and we note that earlier implementations did not fulfill the criterion of “open as to services”, which is a key aspect of the emerging semantic web. For this reason, in the past twelve months we have carried out a radical redesign of Magpie, resulting in a novel architecture, which is open both with respect to ontologies and semantic web services. This new architecture goes beyond the idea of merely providing support for semantic web browsing and can be seen as a software framework for designing and implementing semantic web applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dzbor, Dr Martin","Motta, Prof Enrico","Domingue, Dr John"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Berners-Lee, J Hendler and O Lassila.

An important precondition for realizing the goal of a semantic web is the ability to annotate web resources with semantic information. In order to carry out this task, users need appropriate representation languages, ontologies, and support tools. In this paper we present MnM, an annotation tool which provides both automated and semi-automated support for annotating web pages with semantic contents. MnM integrates a web browser with an ontology editor and provides open APIs to link to ontology servers and for integrating informa-tion extraction tools. MnM can be seen as an early example of the next genera-tion of ontology editors, being web-based, oriented to semantic markup and providing mechanisms for large-scale automatic markup of web pages.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vargas-Vera, Dr Maria","Motta, Dr Enrico","Domingue, Dr John","Lanzoni, Mr Mattia","Stutt, Dr Arthur","Ciravegna, Dr Fabio"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E A.

An important precondition for realising the goal of a semantic web is the ability to annotate web resources with semantic information. In order to carry out this task, users need appropriate representation languages, ontologies, and support tools. In this paper we present MnM, an annotation tool which provides both automated and semi-automated support for annotating web pages with semantic contents. MnM integrates a web browser with an ontology editor and provides open APIs to link to ontology servers and for integrating information extraction tools. MnM can be seen as an early example of the next generation of ontology editors, being web-based, oriented to semantic markup and providing mechanisms for large-scale automatic markup of web pages.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vargas-Vera, Dr Maria","Motta, Dr Enrico","Domingue, Dr John","Lanzoni, Mr Mattia","Stutt, Dr Arthur","Ciravegna, Dr Fabio"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R S Mickalski, I Mozetic, J Hong and H Lavrack.

The system is based on supervised learning and therefore learns extraction rules from annotated text and then applies those rules on newly documents for ontology population. It is based on three componentes: Marmot, a natural language processor; Crystal, a dictionary induction tool; and Badger, an information extraction tool. The important part of the entire cycle is a user who accepts, rejects or modifies newly extracted and suggested instances to be populated. A description of experiments performed with\r\ntext corpus consisting of 91 documents is given in turn. The results cover the paper and support a presented hypothesis of assigning a rule confidence value to each extraction rule to improve the performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Celjuska, Mr David","Vargas-Vera, Dr Maria"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P CLARK.

It relies on a number of different types of ontologies to declaratively describe all aspects of a web application. This paper focuses on the OntoWeaver customization framework, which exploits a user model, a customization rule model, and a declarative site model, to enable the design and development of customized web applications at a conceptual level. OntoWeaver makes use of the Jess inference engine to reason upon the site specifications and their underlying site ontologies according to the customization rules and the valuable user profiles to provide customization support in an intelligent way.  The ontology-based approach enables the target web applications to be represented in an exchangeable format. Hence, the management and maintenance of web applications can be carried out at a conceptual level without having to worry about the implementation details. Likewise, the declarative nature of the site specifications and the generic customization framework allow the specification of customization requirements to be carried out at the conceptual level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lei, Ms Y","Motta, Prof E","Domingue, Dr J"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Berners-Lee, R Fielding and L Masinter.

Ad-hoc rapid prototyping easily leads to unsatisfactory results, e.g. poor maintainability and extensibility. However, existing web design frameworks focus exclusively on data presentation: the development of specific functionalities is still achieved through low-level programming. In this paper we address this issue by describing our work on the integration of (semantic) web services into a web design framework, OntoWeaver. The resulting architecture, OntoWeaver-S, supports rapid prototyping of service-centred data-intensive web sites, which allow access to remote web services. In particular, OntoWeaver-S is integrated with a comprehensive web service platform, IRS-II, for the specification, discovery, and execution of web services. Moreover, it employs a set of comprehensive site ontologies to model and represent all aspects of service-centred data-intensive web sites, and thus is able to offer high level support for the design and development process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lei, Ms Y","Motta, Prof E","Domingue, Dr J"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Ankolekar, M Burstein, J Hobbs, O Lassila, D Martin, D McDermott, S McIlraith, S Narayanan, M Paolucci, T Payne and K Sycara.

Moreover, it provides a set of comprehensive site ontologies to model and represent knowledge portals, and thus is able to offer high level support for the design and development process. Finally, OntoWeaver-S provides a set of powerful tools to support knowledge portals at design time as well as at run time.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lei, Ms Y","Motta, Prof E","Domingue, Dr J"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Atzeni, G Mecca and P Merialdo.

We consider a number of problems in evaluating a knowledge artifact like an ontology. We propose in this paper that one approach to ontology evaluation should be corpus or data driven. A corpus is the most accessible form of knowledge and its use allows a measure to be derived of the `fit\u0027 between an ontology and a domain of knowledge. We consider a number of methods for measuring this `fit\u0027 and propose a measure to evaluate structural fit, and a probabilistic approach to identifying the best ontology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brewster, C.","Alani, H.","Dasmahapatra, S.","Wilks, Y."],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"AKT.

The argument is that such an approach will lead to more reliable agent-mediated electronic commerce environments than those in which agents are simply considered to have cooperated or defected. If there is a mismatch between the advertised and actual competence of an agent and the agent fails to complete a task as a consequence of this mismatch, then the description of this agent\u0027s competence should be refined in addition to any loss in reputation. Consequently, this agent is less likely to be employed for an inappropriate task in the future.

Can we identify impossible combinations quickly? The capabilities of combinations can be represented using constraints, and we propose using constraint relaxation to help eliminate impossible combinations. If a relaxed constraint representation of a combination is inconsistent then we know that the original combination is inconsistent as well. We examine different relaxation strategies based on constraint graph properties, and we show that removing constraints of low tightness is an efficient strategy which is also simple to implement.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S White and D Sleeman.

The domain expert is required to specify which category each case belongs to.  Refiner+ infers a description for each of the categories and reports any inconsistencies that exist in the dataset.  An inconsistency is when a case matches a category other than the one in which the expert has classified it. Refiner++ is a new Java implementation of the (LISP-based) Refiner+ algorithm.  The original algorithm was modified in several respects.  Refiner++ was designed to be an application that would allow a domain expert to enter data, manipulate it and examine it without the need for a knowledge engineer to act as an intermediary.  At the time of writing,  the Refiner++ system has been presented to three experts to use on problems in their domains: anaesthetics, educational psychology, and intensive care. The work is ongoing, but at this stage we have identified types of tasks Refiner++ is particularly good at solving, and some for which it is less useful.  The application has met with great interest from domain experts, but as yet none seem willing to use it directly.  Enhancements to the UI and the materials used to introduce a new domain expert to the conceptualisation task inherent in a Refiner++ session are under way.  Shortly we plan to run a series of new studies with further domain experts.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1027549,"sim:weight":0.388872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1027539,"sim:weight":0.263119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1098993,"sim:weight":0.153413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98494,"sim:weight":0.14156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32544,"sim:weight":0.134189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128718,"sim:weight":0.128759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1105405,"sim:weight":0.121682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":856583,"sim:weight":0.117936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1036187,"sim:weight":0.112801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98454,"sim:weight":0.111335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1105413,"sim:weight":0.109394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1127988,"sim:weight":0.100842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1127860,"sim:weight":0.0921319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":692323,"sim:weight":0.0840001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":600880,"sim:weight":0.077913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1089867,"sim:weight":0.0749218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1089872,"sim:weight":0.0719241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1099120,"sim:weight":0.0688009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1105459,"sim:weight":0.0676477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1035561,"sim:weight":0.0653818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":42549,"ep:Repository":4,"dc:type":["Book Chapter"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Ontology Reconciliation","bibo:abstract":"Ontologies are being applied very successfully in supporting information and knowledge exchange between people and organisations. However, for many reasons, different people and organisations will tend to use different ontologies. Therefore, in order to exchange information and knowledge, either everyone must adopt the same ontology — an unlikely scenario — or it must be possible to reconcile different ontologies. This chapter examines the issues and techniques in the   reconciliation of ontologies. First, it examines the reasons why people and organizations will tend to use different ontologies, and why the pervasive adoption of common ontologies is unlikely. It then reviews alternative architectures for multiple-ontology systems on a large scale. A comparative analysis is provided of a number of frameworks, which analyse types of mismatches between ontologies. The process of ontology reconciliation is outlined. Finally, some existing software tools that support reconciliation are surveyed, and areas are identified where further work is necessary.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hameed, Adil","Preece, Alun","Sleeman, Derek"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"O Corcho and Go´mez-Pe´rez.

We refer to these steps as the process of characterization of a Knowledge Base. Identify-Knowledge-Base (IKB) is a tool, which suggests the principal topic(s) addressed by the Knowledge Base. It matches concepts extracted from a particular knowledge base against some reference taxonomy, where the taxonomy can be pre-stored or extracted from ontologies which are either stored on the local machine or are assessable through the WWW. The \u0027most specific\u0027 super-concept subsuming these concepts is said to be the principal topic of the knowledge base. Additionally, a series of filters, which check if a KB has particular characteristics have been implemented. This paper describes both the Identify-Knowledge Base system and these filters. Some empirical studies of IKB and the filters with a range of problems are also reported.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sleeman, Prof. Derek","Zhang, Mr. Yi","Vasconcelos, Dr. Wamberto"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Sleeman, S Potter, D Robertson and W M Schorlemmer.

A prerequisite to this, however, is the emergence and evolution of the Semantic Web, which provides the infrastructure for the semantic interoperability of Web Services. Web Services will be augmented with rich formal descriptions of their capabilities, such that they can be utilized by applications or other services without human assistance or highly constrained agreements on interfaces or protocols. Thus, Semantic Web Services have the potential to change the way knowledge and business services are consumed and provided on the Web. In this paper, we survey the state of the art of current enabling technologies for Semantic Web Services. In addition, we characterize the infrastructure of Semantic Web Services along three orthogonal dimensions: activities, architecture and service ontology. Further, we examine and contrast three current approaches to SWS according to the proposed dimensions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cabral, L.","Domingue, J.","Motta, E.","Payne, T.","Hakimpour, F."],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Hendler Berners-Lee, J Lassila and O.

IRS-II has three main classes of features which distinguish it from other work on semantic web services. Firstly, it supports one-click publishing of standalone software: IRS-II automatically creates the appropriate wrappers, given pointers to the standalone code. Secondly, it explicitly distinguishes between tasks (what to do) and methods (how to achieve tasks) and as a result supports capability-driven ser-vice invocation; flexible mappings between services and problem specifications; and dynamic, knowledge-based service selection. Finally, IRS-II services are web service compatible – standard web services can be trivially published through the IRS-II and any IRS-II service automatically appears as a standard web service to other web service infrastructures. In the paper we illus-trate the main functionalities of IRS-II through a scenario involving a distrib-uted application in the healthcare domain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Motta, Professor Enrico","Domingue, Dr John","Cabral, Liliana","Gaspari, Mauro"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"V R Benjamins, E Plaza, E Motta, D Fensel, R Studer, B Wielinga, G Schreiber, Z Zdrahal and S Decker.

Given a set of Knowledge Bases (KBs) and Problem Solvers (PSs), the MUSKRAT-Advisor investigates whether the available KBs will fulfil the requirements of the selected PS for a given problem. We would like to reject impossible combinations of KBs and PSs quickly. We propose to represent combinations of KBs and PSs as CSPs. If a CSP is not consistent, then the combination does not fulfil the requirements. The problem then becomes one of quickly identifying inconsistent CSPs. To do this, we propose to relax the CSPs: if we can prove that the relaxed version is inconsistent then we know that the original CSP is also inconsistent. It is not obvious that solving relaxed CSPs is any easier. In fact, phase transition research (e.g. [2]) seems to indicate the opposite when the original CSP is inconsistent. We have experimented with randomly generated CSPs [3], where the tightness of the constraints in a problem varies uniformly. We have shown that careful selection of the constraints to relax can save up to 70% of the search time. We have also investigated practical heuristics for relaxing CSPs. Experiments show that the simple strategy of removing constraints of low tightness is effective, allowing us to save up to 30% of the time on inconsistent problems without introducing new solutions.\r\nIn the constraints area, future work will look at extending this approach to more realistic CSPs. The focus will be on scheduling problems, which are likely to involve non-binary and global constraints, and constraint graphs with particular properties (e.g. [4]). We will also investigate more theoretical CSP concepts, including higher consistency levels and problem hardness. Success in this research will allow us to apply constraint satisfaction and relaxation techniques to the problem of knowledge base reuse.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Nordlander, K Brown and D Sleeman.

This paper presents a novel approach to question answering: the use of argumentation techniques. Our question answering system deals with argumentation in student essays: it sees an essay as an answer to a question and gauges its quality on the basis of the argumentation found in it. Thus, the system looks for expected types of argumentation in essays (i.e. the expectation is that the kind of argumentation in an essay is correlated to the type of question). Another key feature of our work is our proposed categorisation for argumentation in student essays, as opposed to categorisation of argumentation in research papers, where - unlike the case of student essays - it is relatively well-known which kind of argumentation can be found in specific sections","bibo:AuthorList":["Moreale, Miss E.","Vargas-Vera, Dr M."],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Vargas-Vera, E Motta and J Domingue.

AquaLog is a portable question-answering system which takes queries expressed in natural language and an ontology as input and returns answers drawn from one or more knowledge bases (KBs), which instantiate the input ontology with domain-specific information. AquaLog makes use of the GATE NLP platform, string metrics algorithms, WordNet and a novel ontology-based relation similarity service to make sense of user queries with respect to the target knowledge base. Fi-nally, although AquaLog has primarily been designed for use with semantic web lan-guages, it makes use of a generic plug-in mechanism, which means it can be easily in-terfaced to different ontology servers and knowledge representation platforms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lopez KMi, Miss Vanessa","Motta KMi, Professor Enrico"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"V Lopez and E Motta.

Emphasis in the research community has till now been put on building\r\ntools for manual annotation of documents (e.g. [18]), but only recently has the problem of\r\nproducing automatic or semi-automatic methods for annotating documents become an issue\r\n[17, 27]. The main problem with manual annotation is that it is a difficult, slow, time-consuming\r\nand tedious process that involves high costs and very often a large number of errors as well\r\n(up to 25% in some cases [24]). The latter is especially true in case of user with no experience\r\nof document annotation (naive annotators), while it slightly improves with expert annotators\r\n(about 15%). Manual annotation of documents by naive Web users is quite unlikely to be\r\ncorrect or even performed at all. Information Extraction from texts (IE) is an automatic method for locating important\r\nfacts in electronic documents for successive use, e.g. for document annotation or for information\r\nstoring (such as populating an ontology with instances). IE can provide support in\r\ndocument annotation either in an automatic way (unsupervised extraction of information)\r\nor semi-automatic way (e.g. as support for human annotators in locating relevant facts in\r\ndocuments, via information highlighting). In this paper we present Amilcare, an adaptive IE system designed as support to document\r\nannotation in the SW framework. Amilcare is currently used at a number of sites and has been integrated in a number of SW annotation systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ciravegna, Professor Fabio","Wilks, Professor Yorick"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D APPELT, J HOBBS, J BEAR, D ISRAEL and M TYSON.

One accepted goal is to construct\r\nontologies from a domain specific set of texts. An ontology\r\nreflects the background knowledge used in writing and reading a text. However, a text is an act of knowledge maintenance, in that it re-enforces the background assumptions, alters links and associations in the ontology, and adds new concepts. This means that background knowledge is rarely expressed in a machine interpretable manner. When it is, it is usually in the conceptual boundaries of the domain, e.g. in textbooks or when ideas are borrowed into other domains. We argue that a partial solution to this lies in searching external resources such as specialized glossaries and the internet. We show that a random selection of concept pairs from the Gene Ontology do not occur in a relevant corpus of texts from the journal Nature. In contrast, a significant proportion can be found on the internet. Thus, we conclude that sources external to the domain corpus are necessary for the automatic construction of ontologies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brewster, Mr. Christopher","Ciravegna, Prof. Fabio","Wilks, prof.

Specifically, we focus on two critical\r\nissues in intelligent tutoring - student diagnosis and generation of adaptive explanations. Both\r\ntasks are demonstrated in terminological domains where learners have to familiarize themselves with\r\nconcepts in a specific subject area (e.g. computing, finance, chemistry). Based on CG reasoning,\r\nrobust and computationally tractable algorithms for student modelling and adaptive explanation\r\ngeneration are defined. Two intelligent systems are presented - STyLE-OLM and HYLITE+. STyLE-OLM is\r\nan interactive learner modelling system that extracts extended models of the learners\u0027 cognition.\r\nHYLITE+ is a natural language generation system that generates adaptive Web pages based on a\r\nlearner model(LM).

The model takes into account a reflective nature of designing, and it is based on the interplay between two conceptually distinct knowledge sources – an explicit specification of a problem and a solution to it. The approach is novel in the former investigated aspect that is presented as a semi-formal operation of framing, i.e. interpretation of a\r\nproblem using selected conceptual primitives. We argue that the interpretation of design problems lacks a similar rigorous investigation as problem solving received in both design theory and methodology. Furthermore, two design schemas of frame refinement and problem re-framing are discussed and exemplified.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dzbor, Dr Martin","Zdrahal, Dr Zdenek"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Smithers.

Magpie is an extension to the Internet Explorer that automatically creates a semantic layer for web pages using a user-selected ontology. Semantic layers are annotations of a web page, with a set of applicable semantic services attached to the annotated items. We argue that the ability to generate different semantic layers for a web resource is vital to support the interpretation of web pages. Moreover, the assignment of semantic web services to the entities allows users to browse their neighbourhood semantically. At the same time, the Magpie suite offers trigger functionality based on the patterns of an automatically updated semantic log. The benefits of such an approach are illustrated by a semantically enriched browsing history management.","bibo:AuthorList":["Domingue, Dr John","Dzbor, Dr Martin","Motta, Prof Enrico"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Berners-Lee, J Hendler and O Lassila.

The methodology is based on a combination of information extraction, information integration and machine learning techniques. Learning is seeded by extracting information from structured\r\nsources (e.g. databases and digital libraries) or a user-defined lexicon. Retrieved information is then used to partially annotate documents. Annotated documents are used to bootstrap learning for simple Information Extraction (IE) methodologies, which in turn will produce more annotation\r\nto annotate more documents that will be used to train more complex IE engines and so on. In this paper we describe the methodology and its implementation in the Armadillo system, compare it with the current state of the art, and describe the details of an implemented application. Finally we draw some conclusions and highlight some challenges and future work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ciravegna, Prof Fabio","Chapman, Sam","Dingli, Alexiei","Wilks, Prof Yorick"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Sergey Brin.

We then define a lightweight protocol language\r\n  which can express a wide range of inter-agent dialogues, and we use\r\n  the SPIN model checker to verify properties of this language.  Our\r\n  initial results show this approach has a satisfactory success rate\r\n  in the detection of failures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walton, Dr Christopher"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Booth, H Haas, F McCabe, E Newcomer, M Champion, C Ferris and D Orchard.

Web browsing involves two tasks: finding the right web page and then making sense of its content. So far, research has focused on supporting the task of finding web resources through ‘standard’ information retrieval mecha-nisms, or semantics-enhanced search. Much less attention has been paid to the second problem. In this paper we describe Magpie, a tool which supports the in-terpretation of web pages. Magpie offers complementary knowledge sources, which a reader can call upon to quickly gain access to any background knowl-edge relevant to a web resource. Magpie automatically associates an ontology-based semantic layer to web resources, allowing relevant services to be invoked within a standard web browser. Hence, Magpie may be seen as a step towards a semantic web browser. The functionality of Magpie is illustrated using exam-ples of how it has been integrated with our lab’s web resources.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dzbor, Dr Martin","Domingue, Dr John","Motta, Prof Enrico"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Berners-Lee, J Hendler and O Lassila.

However, the precise nature of these favourable conditions is poorly articulated, and as a result organisations run the risk of instigating costly and time-consuming data mining episodes upon inappropriate or irrelevant data. In response to this problem, the authors have applied expert systems technologies to the task of predicting the extent to which a given database contains knowledge that is both valuable and susceptible to mining. It is intended that this system will form a component of a `knowledge auditing\u0027 method for appraising an organisation\u0027s (existing and potential) knowledge resources.

With the benefit of 15 years\u0027 hindsight, we can see the failure of so many DR systems to be adopted as symptomatic of the more general problem of fostering new kinds of \u0027literacy\u0027 in real working environments. Pursuing Engelbart\u0027s goal of \"augmenting human intellect\", we describe the Compendium approach to collective sensemaking, which demonstrates the impact that a facilitator can have on the learning and adoption problems that plagued earlier DR systems. We also describe how conventional documents and modelling notations can be morphed into and out of Compendium\u0027s \u0027native hypertext\u0027 in order to support other modes of working across diverse communities of practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Conklin, Dr Jeff","Selvin, Dr Albert","Buckingham Shum, Dr Simon","Sierhuis, Dr Maarten"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Aakhus.

The proliferation of ontologies and other similar knowledge-rich and labour-intensive structures as well as their exposure to a distributed environment like the Web, and eventually its successor, the Semantic Web, justifies the need. Although a plethora of solutions have been proposed and used, there are many issues which remain unclear. The most striking one is the antithesis in the availability of solutions for semantic integration as opposed to the abundance of techniques and methods for syntactic integration. In this paper we make the first step towards semantic integration by proposing a mathematically sound application of channel theory to enable semantic interoperability of separate ontologies representing similar domains.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schorlemmer, Dr Marco","Kalfoglou, Dr Yannis"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934425,"sim:weight":0.454448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933284,"sim:weight":0.410677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934830,"sim:weight":0.387606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934682,"sim:weight":0.383266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000278,"sim:weight":0.379137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929797,"sim:weight":0.376312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931000,"sim:weight":0.353062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1505140,"sim:weight":0.351232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933095,"sim:weight":0.337521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930751,"sim:weight":0.336314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1510168,"sim:weight":0.323928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934068,"sim:weight":0.313108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1507702,"sim:weight":0.312093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931322,"sim:weight":0.287033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930371,"sim:weight":0.267797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.225926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.211928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.169122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, from the perspective of these environments, these resources are often under-characterised, lacking the ontological characterisation that would enable them to be exploited fully. In this chapter we discuss a technique which can be applied to identify ontological knowledge implicit in a knowledge base. Based on this technique, a tool has been implemented which allows this knowledge to be extracted, thereby promoting the re-use of the resource. A discussion of some complementary research into brokering services within distributed knowledge architectures serves to illustrate the sort of environment in which such re-use might be enacted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sleeman, Derek","Robertson, David","Potter, Stephen","Schorlemmer, Marco"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Crubezy, W Lu, E Motta and M Musen.

This need becomes more pressing when one considers the potential of the Internet for distributed knowledge-based problem solving --- and the pragmatic issues surrounding knowledge integrity and trust this raises.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a formal calculus for describing\r\ntransformations in the `lifecycles\u0027 of knowledge components, along with ideas about the nature of distributed environments in which the ideas underpinning the calculus can be realised. The formality and level of abstraction of this language encourages the analysis of knowledge histories and allows useful properties about this knowledge to be inferred.  These ideas are illustrated through the discussion of a particular case-study in knowledge evolution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schorlemmer, Dr Marco","Potter, Dr Stephen","Robertson, Dr David","Sleeman, Prof Derek"],"dc:date":"2002-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"W M Schorlemmer, S Potter, D Robertson and D Sleeman.

Our interest is to assess whether a chosen problem solver, together with one or more knowledge bases, can satisfy a given problem-solving goal. In general, this is an intractable problem. We therefore introduce an effective, practical, approximation to fitness-for-purpose based on the plausibility of the goal. We believe that constraint programming provides a natural approach to the implementation of such approximations.

The important issues for Socrates were trust and control: he felt the radical decontextualisation that resulted from the portability and stasis of written forms would obscure the author’s intentions, and allow the misuse of the written outside of the local context. Trust has once more become a central problem, both politically and epistemologically, but since Socrates’ day, various technologies have undermined his distinction, making the relationship between trustworthiness and linguistic mode more complex. In this paper, I review the state of the art in Internet technologies, showing (a) how developers and authors attempt to establish trust in their websites or e-commerce processes, and (b) how new work in dynamic content creation further blurs the spoken/written and global/local distinctions.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Hara, Dr Kieron"],"dc:date":"2003-08-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Bal.

They act as corporate memories, transfer best practice, provide mechanisms for situated learning, and act as foci for innovation. Increasingly, organizations are harnessing communities of practice to carry out important knowledge management functions. However, a significant first step is identifying the community, which often doesn’t designate itself as such, and its members, who don’t know they belong! So, this step involves determining which people in a community of practice have common interests in particular practices or functions and producing sets or clusters of related individuals. Community identification traditionally demands heavy resources and often includes extensive interviewing.\r\nIn this article, we describe Ontocopi (Ontology-Based Community of Practice Identifier), a tool to help identify communities. Ontocopi lets you infer the informal relations that define a community of practice from the presence of more formal relations. For instance, if A and B have no formal relation but they have both authored papers with C (formal relation), they might share interests (informal relation). Because Ontocopi works in this way, we cannot claim without qualification that it identifies communities of practice. Significant informal relations might have little or no connection to the formal ones. Here, we refer to the networks uncovered by Ontocopi as COPs and to informal social networks as communities of practice. We work under the assumption that COPs are sometimes decent proxies for communities of practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alani, Harith","Dasmahapatra, Srinandan","O\u0027Hara, Kieron","Shadbolt, Nigel"],"dc:date":"2003-03-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"H Alani, S Dasmahapatra, K O\u0027Hara and N Shadbolt.

At present, these service descriptions are semantically impoverished, being concerned with describing the functional signature of the services rather than characterising their meaning. In the Semantic Web community, the DAML Services effort attempts to rectify this by providing a more expressive way of describing Web services using ontologies. However, this approach does not separate the domain-neutral communicative intent of a message considered in terms of speech acts) from its domain-specific content, unlike similar developments from the multi-agent systems community.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we describe our experiences of designing and building an ontologically motivated Web Services system for situational awareness and information triage in a simulated humanitarian aid scenario. In particular, we discuss the merits of using techniques from the multi-agent systems community for separating the intentional force of messages from their content, and the implementation of these techniques within the DAML Services model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gibbins, Dr Nicholas","Harris, Mr Stephen","Shadbolt, Professor Nigel"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"V Benjamins, E Plaza, E Motta, D Fensel, R Studer, B Wielinga, G Schreiber and Z Zdrahal.

In addition to the cost, time and complexity involved, problems such as knowledge sharing between multiple models and achieving and maintaining integrity between them  are also important. We argue that Multi-Perspective Enterprise Modelling is helpful and in some situations necessary. This paper gives examples of how formal methods, such as logical languages, can provide assistance in making such an approach more appealing and transparent.

This paper describes the multi-perspective modelling approach that has been adopted as a part of the Air Operation Enterprise Modelling (AOEM) project.  Three models have been developed: a  Business Model to describe the concepts and processes that are used in the context of air operations, a  Role Activity and Communication Model to identify actors involved and the operations and interactions between them, and a  Domain-Model to provide a taxonomic structure to capture all concepts that are important to the air operation.\r\n\r\nTo assist the  Multi-Perspective modelling efforts, a formal framework has been proposed which uses  Domain-Model as a light-weight ontology to provide communication of domain knowledge between models which was carried out under the AKT (Advanced Knowledge Technologies) project. This paper shows how the underlying formal method provides the basis for the automation of communication and translation for semi-formal enterprise modelling methods. We also demonstrate how the light-weight ontology Domain-Model can be used as a foundation to provide error-checking and partial quality assurance of multiple models. We suggest that the  MPM approach is valuable in representing, understanding and analysing a complex domain, but that much automated support is still needed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen-Burger, Dr. Yun-Heh"],"dc:date":"2001-02-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh and Ivar Jacobson.

EM methods are used in practice, particularly during the early stages of software system development, e.g. during the phase of business requirements elicitation. The built model, however, has not always \r\nprovided direct input to software system development. Despite the provision of adequate training to understand and use EM methods, informality is often seen in enterprise models and presents a major obstacle. \r\n\r\nThis paper focuses on one type of EM methods: business\r\nprocess modelling (BPM) methods. We advocate the use of a BPM language  within a three-layer framework. The BPM language merges two main and complimentary business process representations, IDEF3 and PSL, to introduce a Fundamental Business Process Modelling Language (FBPML) that is designed for simplicity of use and under-pinned by rich formality that may be used directly to support software and workflow system development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen-Burger, Dr. Yun-Heh","Tate, Prof. Austin","Robertson, Dr. Dave"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A J Bonner.

{"identifier":42621,"ep:Repository":4,"dc:type":["Conference Paper"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Compendium: Making Meetings into Knowledge Events","bibo:abstract":"In this paper, we describe the Compendium methodology and suite of tools. Compendium is the result of over a decade\u0027s research and development at the intersection of collaborative modeling, organizational memory, computer-supported argumentation and meeting facilitation. \r\n\r\nWe claim that Compendium offers innovative strategies for tackling several of the key challenges in managing knowledge: \r\n\r\n· improving communication between disparate communities tackling ill-structured problems \r\n\r\n· real time capture and integration of hybrid material (both predictable/formal, and unexpected/informal) into a reusable group memory \r\n\r\n· transforming the resulting resource into the right representational formats for different stakeholders. \r\n\r\nOur starting point is the face-to-face meeting, potentially the most pervasive knowledge-based activity in working life, but also one of the hardest to do well. Meetings in Compendium\u0027s perspective: \r\n\r\n1. are untapped knowledge-intensive events: often they are unfocused, but they can be improved with facilitated tools that help participants express and visualize views in a shared, common display; \r\n\r\n2. can be more tightly woven into the fabric of work: they are preceded and followed by much other communication and the generation of associated artifacts. \r\n\r\nWeaving the process and products of meetings into this broader web of activity must therefore be a priority. Firstly, we introduce the core elements of Compendium\u0027s approach to mediating face-to-face meetings (now used in a variety of large scale projects). We have found that a combination of facilitation with visual hypertext tools can improve potentially unproductive or explosive meetings between multiple stakeholders with competing priorities. Diverse perspectives can be captured, structured and integrated in a way that all participants collectively own as a trace of their discussions. In the process this constructs a structured, group memory which shows where the same concepts have been discussed in different contexts, why decisions were made, and allows one to harvest related concepts from multiple meetings. \r\n\r\nSecondly, we describe how these \u0027conversational maps\u0027 can be integrated with pre/post-meeting activities and documents. Compendium\u0027s maps are designed to support the granular representation of concepts (as hypertext database objects) so that they can be spatially organized, recombined and reused in multiple contexts. We are developing ways to convert material in conventional applications such as written documents, emails and spreadsheets into concept maps, so that their contents can be analysed in new ways, and integrated with other maps. \r\n\r\nConversely, we have placed great emphasis on generating alternate documents directly from maps, since one of the most common purposes of meetings is to advance a project deliverable of some sort, typically, an organizational document of an established genre, using established notations and stylistic conventions. We automatically transform visual maps to file formats for other applications, so that other user communities can immediately benefit from the meeting\u0027s collective work. This is illustrated in a number of ways: \r\n\r\n· Transforming maps into formal notations (eg. data flow diagrams), and requirements documents following established formats \r\n\r\n· Using maps as a collaborative knowledge-elicitation interface, generating input for knowledge-based applications and simulations \r\n\r\n· From synchronous to asynchronous interaction: transforming maps created in real time into web-based interactive discussion-documents to solicit wider, asynchronous input \r\n\r\n· Ontology-based formalization: in domains where it is possible to work with formal knowledge models, discussion-documents can be annotated with links to ontologies \r\n\r\n· Engaging with visual, emotional knowledge: using maps to capture collaborative sense-making using images to express intuitions and metaphors. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, Compendium excels in enabling groups to collectively elicit, organize and validate information required by a particular community for a particular purpose. In order to integrate this with pre/post-meeting processes and artifacts, these maps can be generated by, and transformed into, other document formats, enabling asynchronous discussions around the contents of maps, and other forms of computation and analysis. In our experiences to date, the domain independence of Compendium\u0027s mapping technique for meetings, combined with its interoperability with domain-specific applications, provides a powerful platform for knowledge construction and negotiation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Selvin, A","Buckingham Shum, S","Sierhuis, M","Conklin, J","Zimmermann, B","Palus, C","Drath, W","Horth, D","Domingue, J","Motta, E","Li, G"],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Buckingham Shum, S Motta, E and J ScholOnto Domingue.

Within an organisation, organisational ontologies capture precise knowledge about organisational entities: people, projects, activities, information sources and so on. We extract useful entities and their relationships from an ontology-driven knowledge base. We also process collections of documents (archives) accumulated in heterogeneous information-bases within an organisation and derive indexing parameters. This information is then mapped to a weighted graph (spreading activation network). The network contains three distinct sets of nodes representing documents, ontological entities and statistically derived entities. Document nodes are connected to both ontology-driven entities and statistically derived entities, and vice-versa with relevant weights. Retrieval is performed by spreading query-based activation into the network and selecting the most-activated nodes. Experts as well as users in the organisation either navigate the network using associative relations among nodes or with specific queries. Expert’s feedback is captured and the network weights are continuously adapted. This framework essentially combines precise knowledge (ontology-driven), non-precise knowledge (statistically driven) and Expert’s feedback (adaptation and refining) into a single framework for effective information retrieval and navigation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hasan, Dr Md Maruf"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.572811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930463,"sim:weight":0.399453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.397468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.387599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.368358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930480,"sim:weight":0.352526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929779,"sim:weight":0.338536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2037,"sim:weight":0.335358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.334086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932725,"sim:weight":0.324863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.321047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18693,"sim:weight":0.306436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930488,"sim:weight":0.289542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42669,"sim:weight":0.278126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":274,"sim:weight":0.250163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999577,"sim:weight":0.248911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42512,"sim:weight":0.248478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930507,"sim:weight":0.242845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827200,"sim:weight":0.239488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.23082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Currently, the semantic web community is necessarily preoccupied with infrastructure design (e.g., knowledge representation languages for the web, scaling issues,standardising terminologies and agent interoperability). But once this infrastructure is in place, more persistent questions will remain concerning the technology\u0027s relationship to the people expected to use it.

The sorts of transformations used in knowledge engineering are not always trustworthy: some may not preserve the semantics of the knowledge transformed; some may not be able to perform a given transformation reliably under all circumstances. Therefore, it is crucial to have ways of inspecting the key properties we expect to be preserved by each transformational component and of describing how these properties change as new transformations are applied.\r\nWe present initial experiments on a large-scale knowledge engineering problem and show how an abstract characterisation of knowledge-transformation steps, accompanied by a customisable editor, can allow a high degree of automation in this task.

However, from the perspective of these environments, these resources are often undercharacterised, lacking the ontological and structural characterisation that would enable them to be exploited fully.\r\nIn this paper we discuss two currently independent services, both integrated with their environment via a brokering mechanism. The first of these services is an ontology extraction tool, which can be used to identify ontological knowledge implicit in a knowledge base. The second service involves characterising a given knowledge base in terms of the topic it addresses and the structure of its knowledge. This characterisation should permit a knowledge base to be located and assessed as a potential candidate for re-use in a more intelligent and flexible manner. The discussion of some related research into brokering systems illustrates the roles that these services can play in distributed knowledge architectures as precursors to problem-directed transformation and reuse of knowledge resources.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sleeman, Prof Derek","Robertson, Dr David","Potter, Dr Stephen","Schorlemmer, Dr Marco"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Crubezy, W Lu, E Motta and M A Musen.

This need becomes more pressing when one considers the potential of the Internet for distributed knowledge-based problem solving --- and the pragmatic issues surrounding knowledge integrity.\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a formal calculus for describing transformations in the `life cycles\u0027 of knowledge components, along with ideas about the nature of distributed environments in which the ideas underpinning the calculus can be realised. The formality and level of abstraction of this language encourage the analysis of knowledge histories and allows useful properties about this knowledge to be inferred. These ideas are illustrated through the discussion of a particular case-study in knowledge evolution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schorlemmer, Dr Marco","Potter, Dr Stephen","Robertson, Dr David","Sleeman, Prof Derek"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Barwise and J Seligman.

The essential issues for\r\nthe proposed design are scalability, together with the ability to learn and adapt to changing resources.\r\nAs knowledge is often implicit within electronic resources, and therefore difficult to locate, we have\r\nproposed the use of ontologies, to extract the semantics and infer meaning to obtain the results required.\r\nWe explore the use of communities of practice, applying ontology-based networks, and e-mail message\r\nexchanges to aid the resource discovery process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wills, Dr Gary","Alani, Dr Harith","Ashri, Mr Ronald","Kalfoglou, Dr Yannis","Kim, Dr Sanghee"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930480,"sim:weight":0.464213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26701,"sim:weight":0.294566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827200,"sim:weight":0.279988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.273705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42661,"sim:weight":0.262247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930463,"sim:weight":0.255783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1009635,"sim:weight":0.255704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934804,"sim:weight":0.22919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.223409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1507014,"sim:weight":0.211369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934976,"sim:weight":0.207353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.204698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932706,"sim:weight":0.202818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.1988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930751,"sim:weight":0.191806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932374,"sim:weight":0.190687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933285,"sim:weight":0.170042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.167293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9633940,"sim:weight":0.154998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.135733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Operating over the Semantic Web, there will be a network of collaborating agents, each with their own ontologies or knowledge bases. Change in the knowledge state of one agent may need to be propagated across a number of agents and their associated ontologies. The challenge is to decide how to propagate a change of knowl-edge state. The effects of a change in knowledge state cannot be known in advance, and so an agent cannot know who should be informed unless it adopts a simple ‘tell everyone – every-thing’ strategy. This situation is highly reminis-cent of the classic Frame Problem in AI. We argue that for agent-based technologies to suc-ceed, far greater attention must be given to creat-ing an appropriate model for knowledge update. In a closed system, simple strategies are possible (e.g. ‘sleeping dog’ or ‘cheap test’ or even com-plete checking). However, in an open system where cause and effect are unpredictable, a co-herent cost-benefit based model of agent interac-tion is essential. Otherwise, the effectiveness of every act of knowledge update/maintenance is brought into question.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brewster, Mr. Christopher"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler and Ora Lassila.

Given the continuous and rapid change and dynamic nature of knowledge in all fields, automated methods for construct-ing ontologies are of great importance. All ontologies or taxonomies currently in use have been hand built and require consider-able manpower to keep up to date. Taxono-mies are less logically rigorous than ontolo-gies, and in this paper we consider the re-quirements for a system which automatically constructed taxonomies. There are a number of potentially useful methods for construct-ing hierarchically organised concepts from a collection of texts and there are a number of automatic methods which permit one to as-sociate one word with another. The impor-tant issue for the successful development of this research area is to identify techniques for labelling the relation between two candi-date terms, if one exists. We consider a number of possible approaches and argue that the majority are unsuitable for our re-quirements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brewster, Mr. Christopher"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Berners-Lee, J Hendler and O Lassila.

The\r\ntraditional knowledge management process for knowledge engineers has been to manually identify and\r\nextract knowledge—a complex and time-consuming process that requires a great deal of manual input. As\r\nan example consider the collection of interviews to experts (protocols) and their analysis by knowledge\r\nengineers in order to codify, model and extract the knowledge of an expert in a particular domain.

This paper presents a user-centred methodology for ontology construction based on the use of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. In our approach, the user selects a corpus of texts and sketches a preliminary ontology (or selects an existing one) for a domain with a preliminary vocabulary associated to the elements in the ontology (lexicalisa-tions). Examples of sentences involving such lexicalisation (e.g. ISA relation) in the corpus are automatically retrieved by the system. Retrieved examples are validated by the user and used by an adaptive Information Extraction system to generate patterns that discover other lexicalisations of the same objects in the ontology, possibly identifying new concepts or relations. New instances are added to the existing ontology or used to tune it. This process is repeated until a satisfactory ontology is obtained. The methodology largely automates the on-tology construction process and the output is an ontology with an associated trained leaner to be used for further ontology modifications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brewster, Mr. Christopher","Ciravegna, Dr. Fabio","Wilks, Prof. Yorick"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Fensel, F van Harmelen, I Horrocks, D L McGuiness and P F Patel-Schneider.

Successful comme rcial products have been created and there is an increasing interest on IE in the Internet market. The more the focus is on the user, the more the need for user-specific tools arises. Most of the current approaches are based on an adaptation phase in which the user provides a set of texts with the relevant information highlighted or with associated filled templates. Tagging is just one part of the adaptation task, though, in building real world applications. Adaptation as a one-way process (from tagged examples to rules) is unlikely to provide optimized results for specific users, as different uses will require different types of results (e.g., high recall in some cases, high precision in others). There is the necessity, we believe, to fully support users during the whole adaptation process so to maximize effectiveness and appropriateness of the final application, and to minimize the burden of system adaptation. In this paper we discuss requirements for user involvement in application development in Amilcare, a system for adaptive IE.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ciravegna, Dr. Fabio","Petrelli, Dr. Daniella"],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"Fabio Ciravegna and Daniela Petrelli.

There is currently a strong \r\ninterest in Text Mining technologies (and in particular in \r\nHuman Language-based Technologies), for reducing the \r\nburden of text annotation e.g. for Knowledge Management \r\n[Maybury2001]. In this poster we present Melita, \r\nan annotation interface that uses Adaptive Information \r\nExtraction from texts (IE) for reducing the burden of \r\ntext annotation. In Melita, adaptation starts with the \r\ndefinition of a scenario, including a tag set for annotation \r\n(possibly organized as an ontology) and a corpus of \r\ntexts to be annotated. Annotations are inserted by first \r\nselecting a tag from the ontology and then identifying \r\nthe text area to annotate with the mouse. Differently \r\nfrom similar annotation tools [Day1997, Cunningham2001], \r\nMelita actively supports corpus annotation \r\nusing Amilcare, an adaptive Information Extraction (IE) \r\ntool based on the (LP)2 algorithm [Ciravegna2001].","bibo:AuthorList":["Ciravegna, Dr. Fabio","Dingli, Mr. Alexiei","Petrelli, Dr. Daniela"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Ciravegna.

It is difficult to choose the right information to include in such systems, and the right information is also a prerequisite for maximizing the uptake and relevance. To tackle this problem, most developers adopt heavyweight solutions and rely on a faithful continuous interaction with users to create and improve content. In this paper, we explore the use of an automatic, lightweight ontology-based solution to the bootstrapping problem, in which domain-describing ontologies are analysed to uncover significant yet implicit relationships between instances. We illustrate the approach by using such an analysis to provide content automatically for the initial set-up of an organizational memory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alani, Harith","Kalfoglou, Yannis","O\u0027Hara, Kieron","Shadbolt, Nigel"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Abecker, A Bernardi, K Hinkelmann, O Kuhn and M Sintek.

Although Web page annotations could facilitate such knowledge gathering, annotations are rare and will probably never be rich or detailed enough to cover all the knowledge these documents contain. Manual annotation is impractical and unscalable, and automatic annotation tools remain largely undeveloped.\r\nSpecialized knowledge services therefore require tools that can search and extract specific knowledge directly from unstructured text on the Web, guided by an ontology that details what type of knowledge to harvest. An ontology uses concepts and relations to classify domain knowledge. Other researchers have used ontologies to support knowledge extraction,1,2 but few have explored their full potential in this domain.\r\nThe Artequakt project links a knowledge-extraction tool with an ontology to achieve continuous knowledge support and guide information extraction.//au: rewrite okay?// The extraction tool searches online documents and extracts knowledge that matches the given classification structure. It provides this knowledge in a machine-readable format that will be automatically maintained in a knowledge base (KB). Users could further enhance knowledge extraction using a lexicon-based term expansion mechanism that provides extended ontology terminology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alani, Harith","Kim, Sanghee","Millard, David","Weal, Mark","Hall, Wendy","Lewis, Paul","Shadbolt, Nigel"],"dc:date":"2003-02-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Vargas-Vera.

Agents will need metadata that describes the content of resources in order to perform operations, such as retrieval, over those resources. In addition, if rich semantic metadata is supplied, those agents can then employ reasoning over the metadata, enhancing their processing power. Key to this approach is the provision of annotations, both through automatic and human means. The semantics of these\r\nannotations, however, in terms of the mechanisms through which they are interpreted and presented to the user, are sometimes unclear. In this paper, we identify a number of candidate interpretations of annotation, and discuss the impact these interpretations may have on Semantic Web\r\napplications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bechhofer, Mr Sean","Goble, Prof Carol","Carr, Dr Leslie","Kampa, Dr Simon","Hall, Prof Wendy"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Bechhofer, I Horrocks, C Goble and R Stevens.

One way of achieving this\r\n  ambitious goal is to provide mechanised ways for mapping and merging\r\n  ontologies. This has been the focus of recent research in knowledge\r\n  engineering. However, we observe a dearth of mapping methods that\r\n  are based on a strong theoretical ground, are easy to replicate in\r\n  different settings, and use semantically-rich mechanisms for\r\n  performing ontology mapping. In this paper, we aim to fill in these\r\n  gaps with a method we propose for Information-Flow-based ontology\r\n  mapping. Our method draws on the proven theoretical ground of\r\n  Information Flow and channel theory, and we provide a systematic and\r\n  mechanised methodology for deploying it on a distributed environment\r\n  to perform ontology mapping among a variety of different\r\n  ontologies. We applied our method at a large-scale experiment of\r\n  mapping five ontologies modelling Computer Science departments in\r\n  five UK Universities. We elaborate on a theory for ontology mapping,\r\n  analyse the mechanised steps of applying it, and assess its ontology\r\n  mapping results.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kalfoglou, Dr Yannis","Schorlemmer, Dr Marco"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98509,"sim:weight":0.276198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98506,"sim:weight":0.247504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997739,"sim:weight":0.243751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49420,"sim:weight":0.242621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1568227,"sim:weight":0.241599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102010,"sim:weight":0.234591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997747,"sim:weight":0.19121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98517,"sim:weight":0.190463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98508,"sim:weight":0.189308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96725,"sim:weight":0.182801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98522,"sim:weight":0.180592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998226,"sim:weight":0.177815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16040,"sim:weight":0.151137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73778,"sim:weight":0.134721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929856,"sim:weight":0.129606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98528,"sim:weight":0.129018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933921,"sim:weight":0.126988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15975,"sim:weight":0.12571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16044,"sim:weight":0.120967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30600,"sim:weight":0.109645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Alice is an ontology based e-commerce project which aims to support online users in the task of shopping. Ontologies describing customers, products, typical shopping tasks and the external context form the basis for the Alice architecture. We also exploit two novel interface metaphors originally developed for navigating databases: the Guides metaphor and Dynamic Queries. The Guides metaphor was developed at Apple to reduce the cognitive load on learners navigating a large hypermedia database. Within Alice we use the Guides metaphor to allow online shoppers to classify themselves. We discuss the link between Alice Guides and Kozinet’s notion of e-tribes or Virtual Communities of Consumption. Our second interface metaphor Dynamic Queries (coupled with Starfield displays) allow users to very quickly find relevant items by displaying the results of queries, posed via specialised slider widgets, within 100 milliseconds. We have constructed a tool, Quiver, which constructs Dynamic Query interfaces on-the-fly as the result of queries to knowledge models stored on the Alice server.","bibo:AuthorList":["Domingue, Dr John","Martins, Dr Maria","Tan, Dr Jaicheng","Stutt, Dr Arthur","Pertusson, Mr Helgi"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Agrawal, H Mannila, R Srikant, H Toivonen and A I Verkamo.

This reduces the burden of creating explicit queries. Recommender systems do, however, suffer from cold-start problems where no initial information is available early on upon which to base recommendations.\r\nSemantic knowledge structures, such as ontologies, can provide valuable domain knowledge and user information. However, acquiring such knowledge and keeping it up to date is not a trivial task and user interests are particularly difficult to acquire and maintain.\r\nThis paper investigates the synergy between a web-based research paper recommender system and an ontology containing information automatically extracted from departmental databases available on the web. The ontology is used to address the recommender systems cold-start problem. The recommender system addresses the ontology’s interest-acquisition problem. An empirical evaluation of this approach is conducted and the performance of the integrated systems measured.","bibo:AuthorList":["Middleton, Mr Stuart","Alani, Dr Harith","Shadbolt, Prof Nigel","De Roure, Prof Dave"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Kibler Aha, D Albert and M.

We explore the acquisition of user profiles by unobtrusive monitoring of browsing behaviour and application of supervised machine-learning techniques coupled with an ontological representation to extract user preferences. A multi-class approach to paper classification is used, allowing the paper topic taxonomy to be utilised during profile construction. The Quickstep recommender system is presented and two empirical studies evaluate it in a real work setting, measuring the effectiveness of using a hierarchical topic ontology compared with an extendable flat list.","bibo:AuthorList":["Middleton, Mr Stuart E","De Roure, Prof David C","Shadbolt, Prof Nigel R"],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Kibler Aha, D Albert and M.

At the core of the framework is a well-established semantic data model (P/FDM) with an associated expressive constraint language (Colan). To allow data instances to be transported across a network, we map our data model to the RDF Schema specification. To allow constraints to be transported, we define a Constraint Interchange Format (CIF) in the form of an RDF Schema for Colan, allowing each constraint to be defined as a resource in its own right. We show that, because Colan is essentially a syntactically-sugared form of first-order logic, and P/FDM is based on the widely-used extended ER model, our CIF is actually very widely applicable and reusable. Finally, we outline a set of services for constraint fusion and solving, which are particularly applicable to business-to-business e-commerce applications. All of these services can be accessed using the CIF.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gray, Prof Peter","Hui, Dr Kit","Preece, Dr Alun"],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Gray, K Hui and A Preece.

APECKS takes a different line to most ontology servers, in that it is designed for use by domain experts, possibly in the absence of a knowledge engineer, and its aim is to foster and support debate about domain ontologies. To that end, it does not enforce ideals of consistency or correctness, and instead allows different conceptualisations of a domain to coexist. The system architecture and lifecycle are introduced, and three extensive scenarios are outlined, showing how APECKS supports ontology construction, learning, ontology comparison and discussion. APECKS has also been used by several subjects during an evaluation experiment, and the results of this experiment are described. A particular factor about APECKS is that, as well as providing internal KA support, it is designed to interface with web-accessible KA tools, thereby allowing theoretically unlimited KA support for users. The prototype used WebGrid-II as external KA support, and the issues involved in integrating APECKS and WebGrid are discussed in detail.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tennison, Dr Jeni","O\u0027Hara, Dr Kieron","Shadbolt, Prof Nigel"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.363033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930751,"sim:weight":0.290353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.269005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932706,"sim:weight":0.258812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930463,"sim:weight":0.245096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.234893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26701,"sim:weight":0.234488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930945,"sim:weight":0.233748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.193307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.187906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45717,"sim:weight":0.179004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932725,"sim:weight":0.166854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9633940,"sim:weight":0.164427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933440,"sim:weight":0.151363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An ideal approach would combine these with the ability to create knowledge content that can be either formal or informal in nature, in a rapid, real-time manner. We will call this Rapid Knowledge Construction (RKC). This paper describes the concepts underpinning our approach to RKC, and provides a case study of the approach in an industry context. The Compendium approach, which has been applied in projects in both industry and academic settings, facilitates the rapid creation of the content of a KM repository, by combining collaborative hypermedia, group facilitation techniques, and an analytical methodology rooted in knowledge acquisition and structured analysis. Compendium addresses key challenges for the successful introduction of KM technologies into work practice: (i) customization for different use contexts; (ii) integration of formal and informal communication; (iii) integration of both prescribed and ad hoc representations; (iv) validation and cross-referencing of the repository ‘on the fly’ at the point of entry; (v) conversion of organizational documents/emails into a hypertext database, and (vi) conversion of hypertext databases into organizational document formats.","bibo:AuthorList":["Selvin, A M","Buckingham Shum, S J"],"dc:date":"2002-03-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L J Bannon and K Kuutti.

However, the concept of applying multiple modelling languages to describe the same domain may still sound frightening to many. In addition to the cost, time and complexity involved, problems such as knowledge sharing between multiple models and achieving and maintaining integrity between them are also important. We argue that Multi-Perspective Enterprise Modelling is helpful and in some situations necessary. This paper gives examples of how formal methods, such as logical languages, can provide assistance in making such an approach more appealing and transparent. We suggest that the MPM approach is valuable in representing, understanding and analysing a complex domain, but that much automated support is needed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen-Burger, Dr. Yun-Heh"],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh and Ivar Jacobson.

However, as exemplified in this paper, in some cases choosing appropriate content can depend on text length and\r\nformatting, which in a pipeline architecture are determined after content planning is completed. Unlike pipelines, interleaved and revision-based architectures can deal with such dependencies but tend to be more expensive computationally. Since our system needs to generate acceptable hypertext explanations reliably and quickly, the pipeline architecture was modified instead to allow additional content to be requested in later stages of the\r\ngeneration process if necessary.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bontcheva, Dr Kalina","Wilks, Prof Yorick"],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Ballim and Y Wilks.

Any knowledge management decision to capture tacit knowledge needs to be informed by the costs incurred and benefits produced. These costs and benefits vary radically depending on properties of the domain, the organization, the knowledge to be captured and the importance of excluding others from the benefits of the knowledge. The picture is further complicated by the difficulties involved in valuing knowledge. We survey these factors, and seek to integrate such considerations into standard knowledge management methodologies (using CommonKADS as an example), and into methodologies for the qualitative valuation of intangible assets.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Hara, Dr Kieron","Shadbolt, Prof Nigel"],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K O’Hara and N Shadbolt.

Knowledge, like customer goodwill or a brand, is an intangible asset for a firm; that is, a non-physical, non-financial claim to future wealth. Intangibles are notoriously difficult to value, but there are a number of reasons why we should try. A series of factors affecting the value of knowledge are discussed, and an ontology that could be used to express some of these is sketched. Such an ontology could be imported by e-business models, to help understand how an organisation’s knowledge adds value to its operations, and therefore to enable informed management of its knowledge assets.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Hara, Dr Kieron","Shadbolt, Prof Nigel"],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Verna Allee.

Hypermedia systems are considered one solution to this problem as they provide a means for representing higher level relationships between the underlying information. However, the amount of information available electronically is increasing at an accelerated rate. Using standard hypermedia authoring techniques, the effort required managing and maintaining large-scale hypermedia systems is enormous. Hypermedia authoring in the large requires new methodologies if it is going to be feasible.\r\n\r\nThis paper presents a new model for building and structuring large-scale hypermedia applications. It describes a case study that explored the delivery of hypermedia information in an industrial environment on a small scale. Models and techniques developed for that case study were then refined and augmented so they could support the construction of large-scale hypermedia systems. In order to support such endeavours a new linking model is presented that allows the author to explicitly represent abstract concepts contained within the underlying information and interconnect them in some meaningful manner. An example usage of this linking technique is then presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heath, Dr Ian","Wills, Dr Gary","Crowder, Dr Richard","Hall, Prof Wendy","Ballantyne, Mr Jim"],"dc:date":"2000-11-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Aichison and A Gilchrist.

Moreover, advances in Internet technology makes it possible to perform most of these task on heterogeneous and distributed environments such as the Web. These advances though, have raised the need for knowledge services to accommodate the ever increasing number of Web users. To provide such a service one needs to combine key technologies for different aspects of knowledge management: capturing, modelling, navigating. This should be tightly integrated with the intented service. We describe such an integration effort in this paper. Our domain is a Web-based news repository and we aimed to provide personalised ontology-driven services on the top of it. We used knowledge capturing technologies to populate the underlying ontologies, knowledge modelling techniques to provide reasoning capabilities for the ontology-driven service, and navigating technologies to overlay Web pages with the ontology driven service","bibo:AuthorList":["Kalfoglou, Yannis","Domingue, John","Carr, Leslie","Motta, Enrico","Vargas-Vera, Maria","Buckingham Shum, Simon"],"dc:date":"2001-04-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934807,"sim:weight":0.533739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997954,"sim:weight":0.477614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997469,"sim:weight":0.452449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.43859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929797,"sim:weight":0.432588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933284,"sim:weight":0.406853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929779,"sim:weight":0.393209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":901763,"sim:weight":0.383596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998000,"sim:weight":0.383596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930867,"sim:weight":0.364142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998042,"sim:weight":0.346775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26701,"sim:weight":0.314964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934425,"sim:weight":0.310679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933440,"sim:weight":0.283967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.279834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1505815,"sim:weight":0.263268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.261136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.236864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000223,"sim:weight":0.231419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9633940,"sim:weight":0.169709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We show that when a community\u0027s perspective on an issue is stable, it opens the possibility for introducing knowledge services, based on an ontology co-constructed by knowledge engineers with stakeholders. Using a case study we describe our approach, ontology-driven document enrichment, looking at how ontology construction and population can be supported by Web based technologies","bibo:AuthorList":["Domingue, John","Motta, Enrico","Buckingham Shum, Simon","Vargas-vera, Maria","Kalfoglou, Yannis"],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934867,"sim:weight":0.49832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934807,"sim:weight":0.427542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.383448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933284,"sim:weight":0.326477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934163,"sim:weight":0.309931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930343,"sim:weight":0.248887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383613,"sim:weight":0.236965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.201816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333889,"sim:weight":0.17526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.165358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45900,"sim:weight":0.157656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We believe that a possible answer to the problem of finding a means through the morass of information on the web to the philosophical insights it conceals and can be made to reveal lies in the process of narrative pathway generation. That is, the active linking of resources into a learning path that contextualizes them with respect to one another. This result can be achieved only if the content of the resources is indexed, not just their status as a text document, an image or a video. To this aim, we propose a formal conceptualization of the domain of philosophy, an ontology that would allow the categorization of resources according to a series of pre-agreed content descriptors. Within an e-learning scenario, a teacher could use a tool comprising such an ontology to annotate at various levels of granularity available philosophical materials, and let the students explore this semantic space in an unsupervised manner, according to pre-defined narrative pathways.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pasin, Michele","Motta, Enrico"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.307072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.289953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930751,"sim:weight":0.289933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.284357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513322,"sim:weight":0.281588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.27392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98772,"sim:weight":0.271656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382496,"sim:weight":0.259149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930973,"sim:weight":0.23502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45717,"sim:weight":0.228878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9633940,"sim:weight":0.197871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383671,"sim:weight":0.187453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.186474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.160877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Induction is performed by \r\nbottom-up generalisation of examples in a \r\ntraining corpus. Training is performed in two \r\nsteps: initially a set of tagging rules is learned; \r\nthen additional rules are induced to correct \r\nmistakes and imprecision in tagging. Shallow \r\nNLP is used to generalise rules beyond the flat \r\nword structure. Generalization allows a better \r\ncoverage on unseen texts, as it limits data \r\nsparseness and overfitting in the training phase. \r\nIn experiments on publicly available corpora the \r\nalgorithm outperforms any other algorithm \r\npresented in literature and tested on the same \r\ncorpora.

One persistent and pervasive problem is that of the resolution or elimination of coreference that arises when more than one identifier is used to refer to the same resource. Tackling this problem is crucial for the referential integrity, and subsequently the quality of results, of any ontology-based knowledge service. We have built a coreference management service to be used alongside the population and maintenance of an ontology. An ontology based knowledge service that identifies communities of practice (CoPs) is also used to maintain the heuristics used in the coreference management system. This approach is currently being applied in a large scale experiment harvesting resources from various UK computer science departments with the aim of building a large, generic web-accessible ontology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alani, Dr Harith","Dasmahapatra, Dr Srinandan","Gibbins, Dr Nicholas","Glaser, Hugh","Harris, Steve","Kalfoglou, Dr Yannis","O\u0027Hara, Dr Kieron","Shadbolt, Prof Nigel"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"H Alani, S Dasmahapatra, N Gibbins, H Glaser, S Harris, Y Kalfoglou, K O’Hara and N Shadbolt.

{"identifier":363587,"ep:Repository":4,"dc:type":["Book Chapter"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Formal Support for Adaptive Workflow Systems in a Distributed Environment","bibo:abstract":"To achieve more widespread application, Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) need to be developed to operate in dynamic environments where they are expected to ensure that users are supported in performing flexible and creative tasks while maintaining organisational norms. In order to cope with these demands, the systems must provide knowledge about the business process itself and the organisational context in that these processes operate. It, however, is not an easy task to provide the appropriate and sufficient knowledge at the right level of abstraction that supports a workflow system at all stages of operation in a dynamic environment and for different types of users. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, Enterprise Modelling (EM) methods are well recognised for their value in describing complex domains in an organised but usually informal structure. In particular, business process modelling techniques provide rich conceptualisations that tend to describe the type of information required by the adaptive workflow systems. However, because of their lack of formal structure the use of Enterprise Models that have been developed is limited. \r\n\r\nWe propose the use of a formal language within a three-layered framework. This language helps to turn the information contained in an informal Enterprise Model into the kind of formal model required by an adaptive Workflow System. In its current state of development, FBPML (Fundamental Business Process Modelling Language) covers business processes, organisational structure, agents and their capabilities as well as execution logic that gives direct instructions to a workflow engine. \r\n\r\nWe assist modelling efforts of Enterprise Modellers by giving them a visual modelling language, underpinned by a formal representation, that is expressive and easy to use and that lets them specify the information required by a workflow engine. In this paper, we present our formal enterprise modelling language, FBPML. We show how adaptive workflow systems, like those developed at AIAI (e.g. the Task Based Process Manager, AKT Workflow and I-X system), can take advantage of Enterprise Models represented in FBPML to provide effective support to users in real business environments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen-Burger, Dr. Yun-Heh","Stader, Ms. Jussi"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930718,"sim:weight":0.506391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933305,"sim:weight":0.374591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929818,"sim:weight":0.325661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44505,"sim:weight":0.296245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99444,"sim:weight":0.269741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47237,"sim:weight":0.262707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335006,"sim:weight":0.239143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44432,"sim:weight":0.237375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.232006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.222532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.198909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46712,"sim:weight":0.191142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933440,"sim:weight":0.143395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334468,"sim:weight":0.121356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper analyses these obstacles in the way of re-engineering in Singapore – a democratic one-party state where legislative and executive power lies with the People’s Action Party – and considers how that hegemony has aided the development of e-government.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9428799,"sim:weight":0.669028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932942,"sim:weight":0.383887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47192,"sim:weight":0.303717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512276,"sim:weight":0.24859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1923603,"sim:weight":0.245732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930945,"sim:weight":0.242739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47375,"sim:weight":0.233603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930155,"sim:weight":0.220324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47461,"sim:weight":0.216705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":464480,"sim:weight":0.199132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":791981,"sim:weight":0.194997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929828,"sim:weight":0.192853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1511206,"sim:weight":0.178497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47362,"sim:weight":0.170487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47601,"sim:weight":0.168872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48344,"sim:weight":0.166719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45399,"sim:weight":0.162958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.15425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.150303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45224,"sim:weight":0.13778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":363602,"ep:Repository":4,"dc:type":["Conference Paper"],"bibo:shortTitle":"LRD: Latent Relation Discovery for Vector Space Expansion and Information Retrieval","bibo:abstract":"In this paper, we propose a text mining method called LRD (latent relation discovery), which extends the traditional vector space model of document representation in order to improve information retrieval (IR) on documents and document clustering. Our LRD method extracts terms and entities, such as person, organization, or project names, and discovers relationships between them by taking into account their co-occurrence in textual corpora. Given a target entity, LRD discovers other entities closely related to the target effec-tively and efficiently. With respect to such relatedness, a measure of relation strength between entities is defined. LRD uses relation strength to enhance the vector space model, and uses the enhanced vector space model for query based IR on documents and clustering documents in order to discover complex rela-tionships among terms and entities. Our experiments on a standard dataset for query based IR shows that our LRD method performed significantly better than traditional vector space model and other five standard statistical methods for vector expansion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gonçalves, Mr. Alexandre","Zhu, Dr. Jianhan","Song, Dr. Dawei","Uren, Dr. Victoria","Pacheco, Prof. Roberto"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1019191,"sim:weight":0.242182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1083612,"sim:weight":0.2412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133706,"sim:weight":0.239352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1024016,"sim:weight":0.223428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997461,"sim:weight":0.21418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":779129,"sim:weight":0.213714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":707237,"sim:weight":0.2083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":960717,"sim:weight":0.20184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934124,"sim:weight":0.200064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1116445,"sim:weight":0.195976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997910,"sim:weight":0.176997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.132292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930470,"sim:weight":0.12436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46042,"sim:weight":0.10424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.0998788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":363603,"ep:Repository":4,"dc:type":["Conference Paper"],"bibo:shortTitle":"ConEditor+: Capture and Maintenance of Constraints in Engineering Design","bibo:abstract":"The Designers’ Workbench is a system, developed to support designers in large organizations, such as Rolls-Royce, by making sure that the design is consistent with the specification for the particular design as well as with the company’s design rule book(s). Currently, to capture the constraint information, a domain expert (design engineer) has to work with a knowledge engineer to identify the constraints, and it is then the task of the knowledge engineer to encode these into the Workbench’s knowledge base (KB). This is an error prone and time consuming task. It is highly desirable to relieve the knowledge engineer of this task, and so we have developed a tool, ConEditor+ that enables domain experts themselves to capture and maintain these constraints. The tool allows the user to combine selected entities from the domain ontology with keywords and operators of a constraint language to form a constraint expression. Further, we hypothesize that to apply constraints appropriately, it is necessary to understand the context in which each constraint is applicable. We refer to this as “application conditions”. We show that an explicit representation of application conditions, in a ma-chine interpretable format, along with the constraints and the domain ontology can be used to support the verification and maintenance of constraints.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ajit, S","Sleeman, D","Fowler, D W","Knott, D","Hui, K"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999828,"sim:weight":0.721899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931821,"sim:weight":0.689673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931798,"sim:weight":0.662422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000201,"sim:weight":0.62975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929227,"sim:weight":0.564058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999731,"sim:weight":0.537887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934865,"sim:weight":0.487814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26701,"sim:weight":0.36743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42626,"sim:weight":0.356761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929769,"sim:weight":0.343486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998300,"sim:weight":0.336201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42594,"sim:weight":0.334053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.315494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930565,"sim:weight":0.310042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934035,"sim:weight":0.305975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.238077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930751,"sim:weight":0.227488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.224019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1507968,"sim:weight":0.160569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.126645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Presented with it are also opportunities to exploit this information meaningfully and benefiting from it. \r\n\r\nModern organisations have to quickly adapt to this new phenomenon: software applications, database and expert systems that were designed and run by a closed group of software and knowledge engineers who had centralised control over the entire lifecycle of IT artefacts seem to be old practice today. Moreover, the distributed nature of IT systems has experienced a dramatic explosion with the arrival and generalised use of the Internet and its associated technologies – hypertext and XML based documents, online databases, terminological repositories, Web services, blogs - which continually challenge the traditional roles of IT in our society.  \r\n\r\nTo address these problems, we investigate the important roles played by human, Organisational Memory (OM) and business processes in an organisation and how they relate to each other. We also speculate that formal logical methods, such as the semantic-based ADP (Actor, Data and Process-oriented) framework proposed here, can interface these important organisational components to help improve the utilisation of an OM, thus lead to organisational performance enhancements. We start our exploration of KM support for enterprise distributed systems by focussing on a core component of many enterprises: the Organisational Memory (OM).","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen-Burger, Dr. Yun-Heh","Kalfoglou, Dr. Yannis"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8933305,"sim:weight":0.423806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1075496,"sim:weight":0.345448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383613,"sim:weight":0.287361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.271569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.263261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827052,"sim:weight":0.259667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.243494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47237,"sim:weight":0.235225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934482,"sim:weight":0.230693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44505,"sim:weight":0.228166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
