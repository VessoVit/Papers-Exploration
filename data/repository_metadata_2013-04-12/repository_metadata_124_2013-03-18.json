DNA ligases are enzymes that catalyze joining of breaks in the backbone of DNA and are of significant scientific interest due to their essential nature in DNA metabolism and their importance to a range of molecular biological methodologies. The electrochemical behavior of DNA at mercury and some amalgam electrodes is strongly influenced by its backbone structure, allowing a perfect discrimination between DNA molecules containing or lacking free ends. This variation in electrochemical behavior has been utilized previously for a sensitive detection of DNA damage involving the sugar−phosphate backbone breakage. Here we show that the same principle can be utilized for monitoring of a reverse process, i.e., the repair of strand breaks by action of the DNA ligases. We demonstrate applications of the electrochemical technique for a distinction between ligatable and unligatable breaks in plasmid DNA using T4 DNA ligase, as well as for studies of the DNA backbone-joining activity in recombinant fragments of E. coli DNA ligase.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vacek, J","Cahova, K","Palecek, E","Bullard, DR","Lavesa-Curto, M","Bowater, RP","Fojta, M"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2776258,"sim:weight":0.575075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

More recently the observation that anaerobically grown E. coli nrf mutants were more sensitive to NO· than the parent strain led to the proposal that NrfA might also participate in NO· detoxification. Here we describe protein film voltammetry that presents a quantitative description of NrfA NO· reductase activity. NO· reduction is initiated at similar potentials to NrfA-catalyzed reduction of nitrite and hydroxylamine. All three activities are strongly inhibited by cyanide. Together these results suggest a common site for reduction of all three substrates as axial ligands to the lysine-coordinated NrfA heme rather than nonspecific NO· reduction at one of the four His-His coordinated hemes also present in each NrfA subunit. NO· reduction by NrfA is described by a Km of the order of 300 μm. The predicted turnover number of ∼840 NO· s–1 is much higher than that of the dedicated respiratory NO· reductases of denitrification and the flavorubredoxin and flavohemoglobin of E. coli that are also proposed to play roles in NO· detoxification. In considering the manner by which anaerobically growing E. coli might detoxify exogenously generated NO· encountered during invasion of a human host it appears that the periplasmically located NrfA should be effective in maintaining low NO· levels such that any NO· reaching the cytoplasm is efficiently removed by flavorubredoxin (Km ∼ 0.4 μm).","bibo:AuthorList":["Van Wonderen, J","Burlat, B","Richardson, DJ","Cheesman, M","Butt, JN"],"dc:date":"2008-04-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.233851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90586,"sim:weight":0.188906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225451,"sim:weight":0.145407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.137644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.136359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.133315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870225,"sim:weight":0.132762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229189,"sim:weight":0.123372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4894185,"sim:weight":0.122356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98673,"sim:weight":0.12088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381911,"sim:weight":0.105419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47544,"sim:weight":0.10341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99284,"sim:weight":0.0945437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710587,"sim:weight":0.0918919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710562,"sim:weight":0.0889186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5228600,"sim:weight":0.088096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43583,"sim:weight":0.0847076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145767,"sim:weight":0.0789018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99459,"sim:weight":0.0764396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Classically, the ‘Bacterial’ Nar system is oriented such that nitrate reduction takes place on the inside of this membrane. However, the active site subunit of the ‘Archaeal’ Nar systems has a twin arginine (‘RR’) motif, which is a suggestion of translocation to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. These ‘Archaeal’ type of nitrate reductases are part of a group of molybdoenzymes with an ‘RR’ motif that are predicted to have an aspartate ligand to the molybdenum ion. This group includes selenate reductases and possible sequence signatures are described that serve to distinguish the Nar nitrate reductases from the selenate reductases. The ‘RR’ sequences of nitrate reductases of Archaea and some that have recently emerged in Bacteria are also considered and it is concluded that there is good evidence for there being both Archaeal and Bacterial examples of Nar-type nitrate reductases with an active site on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Finally, the bioenergetic consequences of nitrate reduction on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane have been explored.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martinez-Espinosa, R.M.","Dridge, E.J.","Bonete, M.J.","Butt, J.N.","Butler, C.S.","Sargent, F.","Richardson, D.J."],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8764026,"sim:weight":0.168602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4869622,"sim:weight":0.159681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229189,"sim:weight":0.14439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.13758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145640,"sim:weight":0.133301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.12694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205917,"sim:weight":0.126843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43352,"sim:weight":0.126126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46909,"sim:weight":0.115892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47544,"sim:weight":0.114669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4869277,"sim:weight":0.114401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870225,"sim:weight":0.107836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154372,"sim:weight":0.107559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":511559,"sim:weight":0.105875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98866,"sim:weight":0.102944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45405,"sim:weight":0.102669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4868971,"sim:weight":0.0998272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4893986,"sim:weight":0.0981533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316361,"sim:weight":0.0981127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46512,"sim:weight":0.0968763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) by apoptotic as well as necrotic cells is one major eat-me-signal for macrophages. Annexin A5 (Anx A5) preferentially binds to PS. The availability of Anx A5 knock out (KO) mice allowed us to investigate for the first time if endogenous Anx A5 modulates the immune response towards allogeneic cells. Furthermore, the effect of Anx A5 gene deletion on the phagocytic process as well as on the inflammatory reaction of macrophages was explored. We found that Anx A5 KO mice have a strongly reduced allogeneic cellular immune reaction against primary as well as secondary necrotic cells. In vivo phagocytosis experiments revealed that macrophages of Anx A5 KO mice displayed an increased uptake of necrotic cells. Additionally, an increased secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 of isolated macrophages of Anx A5 KO mice after contact with necrotic cells was observed. Furthermore, the promoter activity of the Anx A5 gene was enhanced after stimulation of macrophages. The tumour size of an allogeneic tumour regressed faster when endogenous Anx A5 was present. These data demonstrate that endogenous Anx A5 influences the phagocytosis of necrotic cells, modulates the immune response towards allogeneic cells and acts as an inflammatory protein.","bibo:AuthorList":["Frey, B","Munoz, LE","Pausch, F","Sieber, R","Franz, S","Brachvogel, B","Poschl, E","Schneider, H","Rodel, F","Sauer, R","Fietkau, R","Herrmann, M","Gaipl, US"],"dc:date":"2008-07","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Hirt UA and Leist M Rapid.

However, skeletal development appears to be normal in mice deficient for either A5 or A6, and the highly conserved structures led to the assumption that A5 and A6 may fulfill redundant functions. We have now generated mice deficient of both proteins. These mice were viable and fertile and showed no obvious abnormalities. Assessment of skeletal elements using histologic, ultrastructural, and peripheral quantitative computed tomographic methods revealed that mineralization and development of the skeleton were not significantly affected in mutant mice. Otherwise, global gene expression analysis showed subtle changes at the transcriptome level of genes involved in cell growth and intermediate metabolism. These results indicate that annexins A5 and A6 may not represent the essential annexins that promote mineralization in vivo.","bibo:AuthorList":["Belluoccio, D","Grskovic, I","Niehoff, A","Schlotzer-Schrehardt, U","Rosenbaum, S","Etich, J","Frie, C","Pausch, F","Moss, SE","Poschl, E","Bateman, JF","Brachvogel, B"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Balcerzak, E Hamade and L Zhang.

Here, we show that sigH and the upstream gene prsH (encoding a putative antisigma factor of σH) form an operon transcribed from two developmentally regulated promoters, sigHp1 and sigHp2. While sigHp1 activity is confined to the early phase of growth, transcription of sigHp2 is dramatically induced at the time of aerial hyphae formation. Localization of sigHp2 activity using a transcriptional fusion to the green fluorescent protein reporter gene (sigHp2–egfp) showed that sigHp2 transcription is spatially restricted to sporulating aerial hyphae in wild-type S. coelicolor. However, analysis of mutants unable to form aerial hyphae (bld mutants) showed that sigHp2 transcription and σH protein levels are dramatically upregulated in a bldD mutant, and that the sigHp2–egfp fusion was expressed ectopically in the substrate mycelium in the bldD background. Finally, a protein possessing sigHp2 promoter-binding activity was purified to homogeneity from crude mycelial extracts of S. coelicolor and shown to be BldD. The BldD binding site in the sigHp2 promoter was defined by DNase I footprinting. These data show that expression of σH is subject to temporal and spatial regulation during colony development, that this tissue-specific regulation is mediated directly by the developmental transcription factor BldD and suggest that stress and developmental programmes may be intimately connected in Streptomyces morphogenesis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kelemen, GH","Viollier, PH","Tenor, J","Marri, L","Buttner, MJ","Thompson, CJ"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In this paper we show that transcription of ssgA and of the upstream-located ssgR, an iclR-type regulatory gene, is developmentally regulated in Streptomyces coelicolor and activated towards the onset of sporulation. A constructed ssgR null mutant was phenotypically very similar to the ssgA mutant. The absence of ssgA transcription in this mutant is probably the sole cause of its sporulation deficiency, as wild-type levels of sporulation could be restored by the SsgR-independent expression of ssgA from the ermE promoter. Binding of a truncated version of SsgR to the ssgA promoter region showed that ssgA transcription is directly activated by SsgR; such a dependence of ssgA on SsgR in S. coelicolor is in clear contrast to the situation in S. griseus, where ssgA transcription is activated by A-factor, and its control by the SsgR orthologue, SsfR, is far less important. Our failure to complement the ssgR mutant with S. griseus ssfR suggests functional differences between the genes. These observations may explain some of the major differences in developmental control between the phylogenetically divergent species S. coelicolor and S. griseus, highlighted in a recent microreview (Chater and Horinouchi (2003) Mol Microbiol 48: 9–15).

Several temperature-sensitive mutant strains of Escherichia coli, including strain GR501, have been described which can be complemented by functional DNA ligases. Here, it is shown that the ligA251 mutation in E. coli GR501 strain is a cytosine to thymine transition at base 43, which results in a substitution of leucine by phenylalanine at residue 15. The protein product of this gene (LigA251) is accumulated to a similar level at permissive and non-permissive temperatures. Compared to wild-type LigA, at 20 °C purified LigA251 has 20-fold lower ligation activity in vitro, and its activity is reduced further at 42 °C, resulting in 60-fold lower ligation activity than wild-type LigA. It is proposed that the mutation in LigA251 affects the structure of the N-terminal region of LigA. The resulting decrease in DNA ligase activity at the non-permissive temperature is likely to occur as the result of a conformational change that reduces the rate of adenylation of the ligase.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lavesa-Curto, M","Sayer, H","Bullard, D","MacDonald, A","Wilkinson, A","Smith, Andrew","Bowater, L","Hemmings, A","Bowater, RP"],"dc:date":"2004-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Subcloning and sequencing showed that bldC encodes a member of a previously unrecognized family of small (58- to 78-residue) DNA-binding proteins, related to the DNA-binding domains of the MerR family of transcriptional activators. BldC family members are found in a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Constructed {Delta}bldC mutants were defective in differentiation and antibiotic production. They failed to form an aerial mycelium on minimal medium and showed severe delays in aerial mycelium formation on rich medium. In addition, they failed to produce the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin, and bldC was shown to be required for normal and sustained transcription of the pathway-specific activator gene actII-orf4. Although {Delta}bldC mutants produced the tripyrrole antibiotic undecylprodigiosin, transcripts of the pathway-specific activator gene (redD) were reduced to almost undetectable levels after 48 h in the bldC mutant, in contrast to the bldC+ parent strain in which redD transcription continued during aerial mycelium formation and sporulation. This suggests that bldC may be required for maintenance of redD transcription during differentiation. bldC is expressed from a single promoter. S1 nuclease protection assays and immunoblotting showed that bldC is constitutively expressed and that transcription of bldC does not depend on any of the other known bld genes.

NAD+-dependent DNA ligases comprise several discrete structural domains, including a BRCT domain at the C-terminus that is highly-conserved in this group of proteins. The over-expression and purification of various fragments of E. coli LigA allowed the investigation of the different domains in DNA-binding and ligation by this enzyme. Compared to the full-length protein, the deletion of the BRCT domain from LigA reduced in vitro ligation activity by 3-fold and also reduced DNA binding. Using an E. coli strain harbouring a temperature-sensitive mutation of ligA, the over-expression of protein with its BRCT domain deleted enabled growth at the non-permissive temperature. In gel-mobility shift experiments, the isolated BRCT domain bound DNA in a stable manner and to a wider range of DNA molecules compared to full LigA. Thus, the BRCT domain of E. coli LigA can bind DNA, but it is not essential for DNA nick-joining activity in vitro or in vivo.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilkinson, A","Smith, A","Bullard, D","Lavesa-Curto, M","Sayer, H","Bonner, A","Hemmings, A","Bowater, R"],"dc:date":"2005-05-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929813,"sim:weight":0.583412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In line with the remarkable functional versatility of p53, which can act on DNA as a transcription, repair, recombination, replication, and chromatin accessibility factor, the modes of p53 interaction with DNA are also versatile. One feature common to all modes of p53-DNA interaction is the extraordinary sensitivity of p53 to the topology of its target DNA. Whereas the strong impact of DNA topology has been demonstrated for p53 binding to sequence-specific sites or to DNA lesions, the possibility that DNA structure-dependent recognition may underlie p53 interaction with other types of DNA has not been addressed until now. We demonstrate for the first time that conformationally flexible CTG·CAG trinucleotide repeats comprise a novel class of p53-binding sites targeted by p53 in a DNA structure-dependent mode in vitro and in vivo. Our major finding is that p53 binds to CTG·CAG tracts by different modes depending on the conformation of DNA. Although p53 binds preferentially to hairpins formed by either CTG or CAG strands, it can also bind to linear forms of CTG·CAG tracts such as canonic B DNA or mismatched duplex. Intriguingly, by binding to a mismatched duplex p53 can induce further topological alterations in DNA, indicating that p53 may act as a DNA topology-modulating factor.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walter, K","Warnecke, G","Bowater, R","Deppert, W","Kim, E"],"dc:date":"2005-12-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2709980,"sim:weight":0.273497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.260114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710687,"sim:weight":0.254704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710568,"sim:weight":0.206127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98501,"sim:weight":0.202078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.197497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709941,"sim:weight":0.190408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99431,"sim:weight":0.189068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98866,"sim:weight":0.183658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.16554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.165452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98670,"sim:weight":0.161148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710361,"sim:weight":0.157276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.149933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.146511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76666,"sim:weight":0.133087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98669,"sim:weight":0.124063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.123821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.122978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.115794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We generated four lens epithelial cell lines derived from DM1 cataracts and two from age-matched, non-DM cataracts. Small-pool PCR revealed typical large triplet repeat expansions in the DM1 cells. Furthermore, real-time PCR analysis showed reduced SIX5 expression and increased expression of the Ca2+-activated K+ channel SK3 in the DM1 cells. These cells also exhibited longer population doubling times which did not arise through reduced proliferation, but rather increased cell death as shown by increased release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Using 86Rb+ as a tracer for K+, we found no difference in the resting K+ influx or efflux kinetics. In all cases, the ouabain sensitive component of the influx contributed ∼50% of the total. However, stimulating internal Ca2+ by exposure to ionomycin not only caused greater stimulation of K+ (86Rb) efflux in the DM1 cells but also induced a higher rate of cell death (LDH assay). Since both the hyper-stimulation of K+ efflux and cell death were reduced by the highly specific SK inhibitor apamin, we suggest that increased expression of SK3 has a critical role in the increased Ca2+-induced fragility in DM1 cells. The present data, therefore, both help explain the lower epithelial cell density previously observed in DM1 cataracts and provide general insights into mechanisms underlying the fragility of other DM1-affected tissues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rhodes, JD","Monckton, DG","McAbney, JP","Prescott, AR","Duncan, G"],"dc:date":"2006-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2777913,"sim:weight":0.602143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755907,"sim:weight":0.468797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75980,"sim:weight":0.355744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.341051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.337641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75685,"sim:weight":0.333193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76804,"sim:weight":0.3294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.326077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.309731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146196,"sim:weight":0.303218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.303217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.294055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.284454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.28317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.278269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.273701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.262924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.254028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631653,"sim:weight":0.253988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75427,"sim:weight":0.253274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The NapA holoenzyme associates with a di-heme c-type cytochrome redox partner (NapB). These proteins have been purified and studied by spectropotentiometry, and the structure of NapA has been determined. In contrast to the well characterized heterodimeric NapAB systems ofα-proteobacteria, such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Paracoccus pantotrophus, the γ-proteobacterial E. coli NapA and NapB proteins purify independently and not as a tight heterodimeric complex. This relatively weak interaction is reflected in dissociation constants of 15 and 32 μm determined for oxidized and reduced NapAB complexes, respectively. The surface electrostatic potential of E. coli NapA in the apparent NapB binding region is markedly less polar and anionic than that of the α-proteobacterial NapA, which may underlie the weaker binding of NapB. The molybdenum ion coordination sphere of E. coli NapA includes two molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide dithiolenes, a protein-derived cysteinyl ligand and an oxygen atom. The Mo–O bond length is 2.6 Å, which is indicative of a water ligand. The potential range over which the Mo6+ state is reduced to the Mo5+ state in either NapA (between +100 and -100 mV) or the NapAB complex (-150 to -350 mV) is much lower than that reported for R. sphaeroides NapA (midpoint potential Mo6+/5+ \u003e +350 mV), and the form of the Mo5+ EPR signal is quite distinct. In E. coli NapA or NapAB, the Mo5+ state could not be further reduced to Mo4+. We then propose a catalytic cycle for E. coli NapA in which nitrate binds to the Mo5+ ion and where a stable des-oxo Mo6+ species may participate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jepson, BJN","Mohan, S","Clarke, TA","Gates, AJ","Cole, JA","Butler, CS","Butt, JN","Hemmings, AM","Richardson, DJ"],"dc:date":"2007-03-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5229189,"sim:weight":0.195238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4879522,"sim:weight":0.181011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4869277,"sim:weight":0.168615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.164469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4877016,"sim:weight":0.123269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870225,"sim:weight":0.120492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4875844,"sim:weight":0.117767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4884268,"sim:weight":0.116636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185139,"sim:weight":0.115836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2971,"sim:weight":0.11259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269928,"sim:weight":0.112135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113592,"sim:weight":0.108072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652822,"sim:weight":0.107795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4877454,"sim:weight":0.101214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870226,"sim:weight":0.101051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.100871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.099571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.0972246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46869,"sim:weight":0.0970603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225451,"sim:weight":0.0964159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of two distinct sigN promoters, sigNP1, was active only during growth on solid medium, when its activation coincided with aerial hyphae formation. Transcription from sigNP1 was readily detected in several whi mutants (interrupted in morphogenesis of aerial mycelium into spores), but was absent from all bld mutants tested, suggesting that sigNP1 activity was restricted to the aerial hyphae. It also depended on sigN, thus sigN was autoregulated. Mutational and transcription studies revealed no functional significance to the location of sigN next to sigF, encoding another SigB-like sigma factor. We identified another potential SigN target, nepA, encoding a putative small secreted protein. Transcription of nepA originated from a single, aerial hyphae-specific and sigN-dependent promoter. While in vitro run-off transcription using purified SigN on the Bacillus subtilis ctc promoter confirmed that SigN is an RNA polymerase sigma factor, SigN failed to initiate transcription from sigNP1 and from the nepA promoter in vitro. Additional in vivo data indicated that further nepA upstream sequences, which are likely to bind a potential activator, are required for successful transcription. Using a nepA–egfp transcriptional fusion we located nepA transcription to a novel compartment, the ‘subapical stem’ of the aerial hyphae. We suggest that this newly recognized compartment defines an interface between the aerial and vegetative parts of the Streptomyces colony and might also be involved in communication between these two compartments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dalton, KA","Thibessard, A","Hunter, JI","Kelemen, GH"],"dc:date":"2007-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":59314,"sim:weight":0.50031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773714,"sim:weight":0.404431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767998,"sim:weight":0.379006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Tendon is a comparatively poorly vascularised tissue that relies heavily upon synovial fluid diffusion to provide nutrition. During tendon injury, as with damage to any tissue, there is a requirement for cell infiltration from the blood system to provide the necessary reparative factors for tissue healing. We describe in this review the response of the vasculature to tendon damage in a number of forms, and how and when the revascularisation or neovascularisation process occurs. We also include a section on the revascularisation of tendon during its use as a tendon graft in both ligament reconstruction and tendon–tendon grafting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fenwick, SA","Hazleman, BL","Riley, GP"],"dc:date":"2002-02-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2776643,"sim:weight":0.763694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776585,"sim:weight":0.728294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5471900,"sim:weight":0.657987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":898731,"sim:weight":0.650182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776591,"sim:weight":0.630765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":955202,"sim:weight":0.346892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13987,"sim:weight":0.241348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55436,"sim:weight":0.18588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using a homologous recombination system, direct evidence is presented that wild-type ligA cannot be deleted from the chromosome of Mycobacterium smegmatis. Deletions of native ligA in M. smegmatis could be obtained only after the integration of an extra copy of M. smegmatis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis ligA into the attB site of the chromosome, with expression controlled by chemically inducible promoters. The four ATP-dependent DNA ligases encoded by the M. smegmatis chromosome were unable to replace the function of LigA. Interestingly, the LigA protein from M. smegmatis could be substituted with the NAD+-dependent DNA ligase of Escherichia coli or the ATP-dependent ligase of bacteriophage T4. The conditional mutant strains allowed the analysis of the effect of LigA depletion on the growth of M. smegmatis. The protein level of the conditional mutants was estimated by Western blot analysis using antibodies raised against LigA of M. tuberculosis. This revealed that a strong overproduction or depletion of LigA did not affect the growth or survival of mycobacteria under standard laboratory conditions. In conclusion, although NAD+-dependent DNA ligase is essential for mycobacterial viability, only low levels of protein are required for growth. These findings suggest that very efficient inhibition of enzyme activity would be required if NAD+-dependent DNA ligase is to be useful as an antibiotic target in mycobacteria. The strains developed here will provide useful tools for the evaluation of the efficacy of any appropriate compounds in mycobacteria.","bibo:AuthorList":["Korycka-Machala, M","Rychta, E","Brzostek, A","Sayer, HR","Rumijowska-Galewicz, A","Bowater, RP","Dziadek, J"],"dc:date":"2007-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2756421,"sim:weight":0.328394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.251571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387289,"sim:weight":0.211428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101609,"sim:weight":0.209811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45241,"sim:weight":0.204687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44537,"sim:weight":0.195887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98501,"sim:weight":0.191338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98662,"sim:weight":0.183252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98866,"sim:weight":0.180386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99353,"sim:weight":0.173173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.163765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.159963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46554,"sim:weight":0.158225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.139391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.136908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99459,"sim:weight":0.127992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98774,"sim:weight":0.121886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98796,"sim:weight":0.116915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98838,"sim:weight":0.113696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":124093,"sim:weight":0.111134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We have characterized the expression of ADAMTS-4 in human Achilles tendon and tendon-derived cells. ADAMTS-4 mRNA levels were higher in ruptured tendon compared with normal tendon or chronic painful tendinopathy. In tissue extracts probed by Western blotting, mature ADAMTS-4 (68 kDa) was detected only in ruptured tendons, while processed ADAMTS-4 (53 kDa) was detected also in chronic painful tendinopathy and in normal tendon. In cultured Achilles tendon cells, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) stimulated ADAMTS-4 mRNA expression (typically 20-fold after 24 h), while interleukin-1 induced a smaller, shorter-term stimulation which synergised markedly with that induced by TGF-β. Increased levels of immunoreactive proteins consistent with mature and processed forms of ADAMTS-4 were detected in TGF-β-stimulated cells. ADAMTS-4 mRNA was expressed at higher levels by tendon cells in collagen gels than in monolayer cultures. In contrast, the expression of ADAMTS-1 and -5 mRNA was lower in collagen gels compared with monolayers, and these mRNA showed smaller or opposite responses to growth factors and cytokines compared with that of ADAMTS-4 mRNA. We conclude that both ADAMTS-4 mRNA and ADAMTS-4 protein processing may be differentially regulated in normal and damaged tendons and that both the matrix environment and growth factors such as TGF-β are potentially important factors controlling ADAMTS aggrecanase activities in tendon pathology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Corps, AN","Jones, GC","Harrall, RL","Curry, VA","Hazleman, BL","Riley, GP"],"dc:date":"2008-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2776591,"sim:weight":0.64401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5837006,"sim:weight":0.530305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776643,"sim:weight":0.456547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776590,"sim:weight":0.410074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776586,"sim:weight":0.391396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776649,"sim:weight":0.325183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776648,"sim:weight":0.305309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776647,"sim:weight":0.299274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776639,"sim:weight":0.271803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.226747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631895,"sim:weight":0.226061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75980,"sim:weight":0.216875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.207119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.20179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.19764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98986,"sim:weight":0.197274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.196862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.194767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.193074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98535,"sim:weight":0.190765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular Graphic (InsP6) is involved in mRNA export and editing or chromatin remodeling among other events. InsP6 accumulates as mixed salts (phytate) in storage tissues of plants and plays a key role in their physiology. Human diets that are exclusively grain-based provide an excess of InsP6 that, through chelation of metal ions, may have a detrimental effect on human health. Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 2-kinase (InsP5 2-kinase or Ipk1) catalyses the synthesis of InsP6 from InsP5 and ATP, and is the only enzyme that transfers a phosphate group to the axial 2-OH of the myo-inositide. We present the first structure for an InsP5 2-kinase in complex with both substrates and products. This enzyme presents a singular structural region for inositide binding that encompasses almost half of the protein. The key residues in substrate binding are identified, with Asp368 being responsible for recognition of the axial 2-OH.

It aims to posit a model for the combination of these long- and short-term organisational activities as a framework for a senior level to manage a firm\u0027s strategic fit as an integrated organisation-wide system that links top management goals to daily management. Design/rnethodology/approach - The resource-based view of strategy is explored for its relevance to how a combined balanced scorecard and hoshin kanri approach serves as a high-order dynamic capability. Examples are given from Canon, Toyota and Nissan, of how core capabilities are managed to show how strategy is executed cross-functionally across a firm\u0027s functional hierarchy. Findings - The study finds that strategic management of the organisation should consider the long-term strategy as well as the short-term capability. Important to this are core capabilities and core competences, cross-functional management, and top executive audits, which, when managed properly, explicate a new view of strategic fit, as a form of nested hierarchies of dynamic capabilities.

Extremely weakly coordinating anions based on perfluorophenyl borates allow the synthesis and structural characterization of complexes in which cation–anion interactions are minimized. The metals are therefore able to coordinate weakly donating ligands without the structural distortions and limitations in coordination geometry that are always encountered when coordinating anions are present. This has led to the isolation of thallium mono-, bis- and tris-arene complexes, thallium–ferrocene multidecker structures and the determination of their bond energies. New types of ether and crown ether adducts, as well as the first examples of cationic alkylzinc derivatives have become similarly accessible. These ionic Zn compounds very effectively polymerize cyclic esters and epoxides. Arene coordination is also a feature of strongly Lewis acidic bis(perfluoroaryl)zinc compounds, which when combined with activated alkyl chlorides provide an excellent new type of initiator for the homo and copolymerization of isoalkenes. These systems have given rise to a new family of elastomer materials.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Thallium; Zinc; Arene complex; Ether complex; Weakly coordinating anion; Crystal structure; DFT calculations","bibo:AuthorList":["Bochmann, M"],"dc:date":"2009-01-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":17964,"sim:weight":0.304932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44701,"sim:weight":0.299625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4878690,"sim:weight":0.287514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1078954,"sim:weight":0.26952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44152,"sim:weight":0.268058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43467,"sim:weight":0.25731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46355,"sim:weight":0.229506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57272,"sim:weight":0.220947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632243,"sim:weight":0.210295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384218,"sim:weight":0.190984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46353,"sim:weight":0.188318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382769,"sim:weight":0.18032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890301,"sim:weight":0.16767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890299,"sim:weight":0.16652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387390,"sim:weight":0.166072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.165005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108515,"sim:weight":0.160401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47587,"sim:weight":0.155104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26068,"sim:weight":0.154206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768991,"sim:weight":0.151655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is of interest, therefore, to identify a means of producing a much more greatly directed character to such a near field, imposing features that are more commonly associated with longer-range, wave-zone electromagnetic propagation. In this paper, it is shown that nonlinear optical coupling with off-resonant, throughput laser light can achieve this effect. Based on a quantum electrodynamical analysis it is shown that two mechanisms contribute; one requires both the source and detector to be irradiated by the throughput radiation, the other can operate with the source alone irradiated. The analysis leads to results identifying the dependence of each mechanism on the relative directions of the laser beam and the sourceï¿½detector displacement. Contour maps of the ensuing near field, at the source emission frequency, exhibit a directionality that grows with the off-resonant beam intensity. The phenomenon affords a means of achieving optical control over the near-field distribution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bradshaw, D. S.","Andrews, D.

Given a suitable geometric configuration it is possible to completely inhibit this energy transfer in such a way that it can only be activated by application of an off-resonant laser beam: this is the principle of optically controlled resonance energy transfer, the basis for an all-optical switch. This paper begins with an investigation of optically controlled energy transfer between a single donor and acceptor molecule, identifying the symmetry and structural constraints and analyzing in detail the dependence on molecular energy level positioning. Spatially correlated donor and acceptor arrays with linear, square, and hexagonally structured arrangements are then assessed as potential configurations for all-optical switching. Built on quantum electrodynamical principles the concept of transfer fidelity, a parameter quantifying the efficiency of energy transportation, is introduced and defined. Results are explored by employing numerical simulations and graphical analysis. Finally, a discussion focuses on the advantages of such energy transfer based processes over all-optical switching of other proposed forms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bradshaw, David S.","Andrews, David L."],"dc:date":"2008-04-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4876220,"sim:weight":0.277388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154249,"sim:weight":0.23446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108107,"sim:weight":0.230896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154431,"sim:weight":0.228097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108049,"sim:weight":0.226454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199834,"sim:weight":0.211165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25943,"sim:weight":0.207614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.206361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98805,"sim:weight":0.202424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108578,"sim:weight":0.202292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268391,"sim:weight":0.199261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734395,"sim:weight":0.198997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23890,"sim:weight":0.197849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98896,"sim:weight":0.197556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154454,"sim:weight":0.187707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108056,"sim:weight":0.185665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271192,"sim:weight":0.185151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154271,"sim:weight":0.184727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43163,"sim:weight":0.183977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271195,"sim:weight":0.182314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this paper, analytical results for this integral are derived for bands of Gaussian and log normal line shape; the methods also prove applicable to double Gaussian curves under suitable conditions. Underlying principles have been ascertained through further development of theory, with physically reasonable assumptions. Consideration of the Gaussian case, widely applicable to spectra of symmetric form, reveals that the directional efficiency of energy transfer depends equally on a frequency shift characterizing the spectroscopic gradient and the Stokes shift.

For the observation of such effects, quantitative assessments of the coupling mechanism suggest levels of intensity that are now routinely available from pulsed lasers. In this paper, a theoretical analysis of the principal mechanism is followed by a development for two specific systems, chosen to illustrate the broad significance and the range of systems in which such effects might be manifest. The first system is a van der Waals dimer, a loosely bound and essentially isolated molecular pair in which a small optically induced shift in the equilibrium bond length proves to be well within the limits of measurement by microwave rotational spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nThe second system illustrates the opposite extreme, where an optically induced modification of the forces between densely packed molecules in the condensed phase is shown to produce anisotropic patterns of laser-induced compression and expansion, an effect termed optical electrostriction. Again, such an effect should be readily measurable, although the necessary conditions are such that a number of secondary effects might also be likely to arise. The experimental challenge of precluding those secondary effects in the condensed phase and unequivocally identifying optically induced intermolecular forces is discussed. Possible applications are also entertained, including optical actuators for nanoscale electromechanical systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andrews, David L","Crisp, Richard G","Bradshaw, David S"],"dc:date":"2006-07-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84813,"sim:weight":0.241341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199834,"sim:weight":0.231095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154454,"sim:weight":0.220797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108049,"sim:weight":0.219517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154271,"sim:weight":0.208277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98502,"sim:weight":0.204922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271192,"sim:weight":0.200326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268391,"sim:weight":0.199372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84924,"sim:weight":0.198615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.197647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890299,"sim:weight":0.191044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270720,"sim:weight":0.18969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.187512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890301,"sim:weight":0.185927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154299,"sim:weight":0.185221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154326,"sim:weight":0.184853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99146,"sim:weight":0.183494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383678,"sim:weight":0.181169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43560,"sim:weight":0.180597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385382,"sim:weight":0.179346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These forces, associated with a pairwise process of stimulated scattering, prove to enable the possibility of producing significant modifications to both the form and magnitude of interparticle forces, with additional contributions arising in the case of dipolar materials. Moreover, such forces have the capacity to generate unusual patterns of nanoscale response, entirely controlled by the input beam characteristics, principally the optical frequency, intensity, and polarization. Based on quantum electrodynamical theory, a general result is secured for the laser-induced force under arbitrary conditions, incorporating both static and dynamic coupling mechanisms. Specific features of the results are identified for pairs of particles with prolate cylindrical symmetry, e.g., carbon nanotubes, where it is shown that the laser-induced forces and torques are sensitive functions of the pair spacing and orientation, and the laser beam geometry; significantly, they can be either repulsive or attractive according to conditions. For nanoparticles trapped in a Laguerre-Gaussian laser beam the results also reveal additional and highly distinctive torques that suggest further possibilities for nanomanipulation with light. The paper concludes with a discussion on several potential applications of such forces.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bradshaw, David S.","Andrews, David L."],"dc:date":"2005-09-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383678,"sim:weight":0.340827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154271,"sim:weight":0.338622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586174,"sim:weight":0.315254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199834,"sim:weight":0.313627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84813,"sim:weight":0.289726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268391,"sim:weight":0.282335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586167,"sim:weight":0.269202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154249,"sim:weight":0.268544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585904,"sim:weight":0.255861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26743,"sim:weight":0.254503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.244733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154454,"sim:weight":0.240018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.231657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154445,"sim:weight":0.227074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269914,"sim:weight":0.218343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270720,"sim:weight":0.218001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585885,"sim:weight":0.217618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109340,"sim:weight":0.214032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154261,"sim:weight":0.207468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154299,"sim:weight":0.199051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Starting from a thorough treatment of the underlying theory based on the principles of molecular quantum electrodynamics, it is possible to identify and characterize several optically nonlinear mechanisms for directed energy transfer and energy pooling in multichromophore dendrimers. Such mechanisms fall into two classes: first, those where two-photon absorption by individual donors is followed by transfer of the net energy to an acceptor;\r\nsecond, those where the excitation of two electronically distinct but neighboring donor groups is followed by a collective migration of their energy to a suitable acceptor. Each transfer process is\r\nsubject to minor dissipative losses. In this paper we describe in detail the balance of factors and the constraints that determines the favored mechanism, which include the excitation statistics, structure of the energy levels, laser coherence factors, chromophore selection rules and architecture, possibilities for the formation of delocalized excitons, spectral overlap, and the overall distribution of donors and acceptors. Furthermore, it transpires that quantum interference between different mechanisms can play an important role. Thus, as the relative importance of each mechanism determines the relevant nanophotonic characteristics, the results reported here afford the means for optimizing highly efficient light-harvesting dendrimer devices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andrews, David L.","Bradshaw, David S."],"dc:date":"2004-05-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1094548,"sim:weight":0.355997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66419,"sim:weight":0.347709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108775,"sim:weight":0.330741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25921,"sim:weight":0.303014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4876220,"sim:weight":0.284855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154189,"sim:weight":0.271885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154235,"sim:weight":0.269117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108107,"sim:weight":0.267916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154320,"sim:weight":0.255187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154316,"sim:weight":0.252449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154454,"sim:weight":0.250613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.243619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154288,"sim:weight":0.239455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573481,"sim:weight":0.230956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22874,"sim:weight":0.213249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.212019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.210574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.210574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.210574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.210574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using an ultrafast Ti:sapphire laser system, a quadratic dependence of the Tb(III) luminescence intensity was observed on excitation with photons at 503 and 566 nm, and a cubic dependence with photons at 800 nm. The two-photon cross-sections at 503 and 566 nm are 7.4 × 10−50 and 0.37 × 10−50 cm4 s photon−1 mol−1, respectively, which compare favourably with values reported for the green fluorescent protein. Three-photon excitation at 800 nm gives rise to a Tb(III) emission spectrum with excellent signal to noise ratios. These results lead to a proposal that if a Tb(III)–protein complex with similar luminescent properties could be formed in vivo, an intra-cellular imaging system that uses multiphoton-excited, long-lived lanthanide ion luminescence could be developed.

Most established theory of Raman and associated light scattering employs a constant-sign rule at odds with a variable sign commonly used in nonlinear optics. However, by focusing on the polarizability it is demonstrated that arguments for the constant-sign convention vindicate standard Raman theory; flaws in the counterpropositions undermine the case for variable signing.

In terms of fundamental quantum interactions, the process is properly described in terms of a virtual photon transit between the pre-excited donor and a lower energy (usually ground-state) acceptor. The detailed quantum amplitude for RET is calculated by molecular quantum electrodynamical techniques with the observable, the transfer rate, derived via application of the Fermi golden rule. In the treatment reported here, recently devised state-sequence techniques and a novel calculational protocol is applied to RET and shown to circumvent problems associated with the usual method. The second-rank tensor describing virtual photon behavior evolves from a Greenï¿½s function solution to the Helmholtz equation, and special functions are employed to realize the coupling tensor. The method is used to derive a new result for energy transfer systems sensitive to both magnetic- and electric-dipole transitions. The ensuing result is compared to that of pure electric-dipoleï¿½electric-dipole coupling and is analyzed with regard to acceptable transfer separations.

Furthermore it is shown how the presence of the third species can effectively ï¿½switch onï¿½ the energy transfer process, under circumstances where conventional energy transfer is forbidden due to orientational effects or on symmetry grounds. For example it is indicated that it is possible to instigate energy transfer when the salient acceptor or donor transitions are one-photon forbidden.

It is shown that although the two mechanisms play significant roles in pooling and cutting, only the accretive mechanism is responsible for sensitization processes. Both mechanisms are shown to invoke Raman selection rules, which govern transitions of the mediator ions in the accretive mechanisms and transitions of the acceptor ions in the cooperative mechanisms. The local, microscopic level results are used to gauge the lattice response, encompassing concentration and structural effects.

A quantum electrodynamical formulation provides a rigorous basis to assess the first of these, specifically addressing the relative significance of higher multipole contributions to the process of energy transfer in donor-acceptor systems where electric dipole transitions are precluded by symmetry. Working within the near-zone limit, where donor-acceptor separations are small in comparison to the chromophore scale, the analysis highlights the contributions of both electric quadrupole-electric quadrupole (E12-E12) coupling and the seldom considered second-order electric dipole-electric dipole (E12-E12) coupling. For both forms of interaction, experimentally meaningful rate equations are secured by the use of orientational averaging, and the mechanisms are analyzed with reference to systems in which E1-forbidden transitions are commonly reported.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andrews, David L.","Leeder, Jamie M"],"dc:date":"2009-05-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":268952,"sim:weight":0.204251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108107,"sim:weight":0.202882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23890,"sim:weight":0.197328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66419,"sim:weight":0.19511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85896,"sim:weight":0.193798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98580,"sim:weight":0.183016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103048,"sim:weight":0.181878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85213,"sim:weight":0.177611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382487,"sim:weight":0.177408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145691,"sim:weight":0.172601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98875,"sim:weight":0.171369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4876220,"sim:weight":0.163514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86239,"sim:weight":0.159911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43176,"sim:weight":0.158881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271192,"sim:weight":0.15667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512958,"sim:weight":0.154514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.151706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890307,"sim:weight":0.146332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101597,"sim:weight":0.141425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385382,"sim:weight":0.138706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper focuses on a system in which there are two absorptive components, each one represented by surface adsorbates arrayed on a pair of juxtaposed interfaces. The adsorbates are chosen to be chemically distinct from the material of the underlying surface. On promotion of any adsorbate molecule to an electronic excited state, its local electronic environment is duly modified, and its London interaction with nearest neighbor molecules becomes accommodated to the new potential energy landscape. If the absorbed energy then transfers to a neighboring adsorbate of another species, so that the latter acquires the excitation, the local electronic environment changes and compensating motion can be expected to occur. Physically, this is achieved through a mechanism of photon absorption and emission by molecular pairs, and by the engagement of resonance transfer of energy between them. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the possibility of optically effecting such modifications to the London force between neutral adsorbates, based on quantum electrodynamics (QED). Thus, a precise link is established between the transfer of excitation and ensuing mechanical effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cizmar, T","Davila Romero, L C","Dholakia, K","Andrews, D L"],"dc:date":"2010-08-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.234695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154235,"sim:weight":0.231821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934790,"sim:weight":0.229894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108049,"sim:weight":0.227167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108107,"sim:weight":0.225447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98609,"sim:weight":0.221845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386605,"sim:weight":0.218022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4876220,"sim:weight":0.212779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45702,"sim:weight":0.21256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25943,"sim:weight":0.211248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271195,"sim:weight":0.210378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145691,"sim:weight":0.203204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890307,"sim:weight":0.202337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85213,"sim:weight":0.201455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.199423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268391,"sim:weight":0.195543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154454,"sim:weight":0.195058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385382,"sim:weight":0.194754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43163,"sim:weight":0.191737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85991,"sim:weight":0.189239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study of a complete free-living species reveals a cost of blood parasitism to an endangered host, the Pink Pigeon Columba mayeri, endemic to Mauritius. We investigated the prevalence and effect of infection of the blood parasite, Leucocytozoon marchouxi, in the free-living Pink Pigeon population. Overall, L. marchouxi infection prevalence detected was 18·3%. Juveniles were more likely to be infected than older birds and there was geographical variation in infection prevalence. Survival of birds infected with L. marchouxi was lower than that of uninfected birds to 90 days post-sampling. This study suggests that while common haematozoa are well tolerated in healthy adults, these parasites may have greater pathogenic potential in susceptible juveniles. The study is unusual given its completeness of species sampling (96%) within a short time-period, the accurate host age data, and its focus on blood parasites in a threatened bird species. Species for which long-term life-history data are available for every individual serve as valuable models for dissecting the contribution of particular pathogens to species decline.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bunbury, N","Barton, E","Jones, CG","Greenwood, AG","Tyler, KM","Bell, DJ"],"dc:date":"2007-01-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":62510,"sim:weight":0.360689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154239,"sim:weight":0.344757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.337139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387066,"sim:weight":0.328661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62227,"sim:weight":0.319305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764132,"sim:weight":0.313917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98856,"sim:weight":0.309825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101909,"sim:weight":0.307329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.303454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.296724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.296487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643700,"sim:weight":0.294618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.293296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.293292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154206,"sim:weight":0.278359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59935,"sim:weight":0.274055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.272055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.272055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108766,"sim:weight":0.271758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.271682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Scores for four Class A drugs (heroin, methadone, speed and crack/cocaine) from both formats were compared.\r\n\r\nResults: The observed agreement was 87% or more and Cohen\u0027s kappa was 0.7 (p \u003c 0.001) or more for all four Class A drugs. Sensitivity for each Class A drugs was 56% or higher and specificity was 87% or higher. Sensitivity for severe heroin dependency was 98% (CI 89–100%). There was a 100% correlation between the ONS-sc and positive urine analysis for heroin use. However, methadone and crack/cocaine drug use appeared under reported.\r\n\r\nConclusion: ONS-sc is a feasible, practical and time-saving alternative to a detailed interview on drug dependence. Further research with a larger sample size and non-opiate-dependent clients are needed, as this could prove a useful tool for monitoring clients in everyday practice, or for survey purposes where interviews are impractical.","bibo:AuthorList":["Uddin, M","Maskrey, VL","Holland, RC"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145923,"sim:weight":0.34056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.315166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.228624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145722,"sim:weight":0.226571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156320,"sim:weight":0.223811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.221845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.216744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.209577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.209231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11157,"sim:weight":0.206088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229643,"sim:weight":0.205363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.201417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.19944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.19944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.19944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.19944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.19944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.19944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.19944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.19944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As an example of an archetypal conserved eukaryotic protein we considered the active site of β-tubulin. Our analysis identified one amino acid substitution—β-tubulin F224—which was highly lineage specific. Investigation of β-tubulin for other phylogenetically restricted amino acids identified several with apparent specificity for well-defined phylogenetic groups. Intriguingly, none showed specificity for “supergroups” other than the unikonts. To understand why, we analysed the β-tubulin Neighbor-Net and demonstrated a fundamental division between core β-tubulins (plant-like) and divergent β-tubulins (animal and fungal). F224 was almost completely restricted to the core β-tubulins, while divergent β-tubulins possessed Y224. Thus, our specific example offers insight into the restrictions associated with the co-evolution of β-tubulin during the radiation of eukaryotes, underlining a fundamental dichotomy between F-type, core β-tubulins and Y-type, divergent β-tubulins. More broadly our study provides proof of principle for the taxonomic utility of critical amino acids in the active sites of conserved proteins.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tyler, KM","Wagner, GK","Wu, Q","Huber, KT"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is shown that non-rotating fluid theory and the Reynolds number are appropriate for describing the occurrence of eddy shedding. For islands at higher lalitudes, thresholds move nearer those found in rotating laboratory experiments Strouhal numbers calculated from the model results agree with those predicted theoretically, confirming that the frequency of eddy shedding does not increase indefinitely with Reynolds number.

A streamwise coordinate system is used, rather than a more conventional approach of considering zonally averaged quantities. The motivation for this approach is the large deviation from a purely zonal flow made by the current. Comparisons are made with a zonal-mean analysis of the same model. It is found that the topographic form drag is the main sink of the momentum that is input by the wind. However, in contrast to a zonal-mean analysis other terms, namely, horizontal mixing, bottom friction, and advection of momentum, are no longer negligible. The total effect of transient eddies is to produce a drag on the mean flow, again in contrast to the zonally averaged case. The vertical penetration of stress is considered. A generalized formula is derived for the interfacial form stress averaged along a convoluted path and that includes nonquasigeostrophic effects. The interfacial form stress is found to be related not only to the local wind stress but also to changes in stratification and the Coriolis parameter along the path of integration. The vertical gradient of the extra terms is found to be proportional to the quasimeridional velocity averaged along an isopycnic surface. Using the model data, the nonquasigeostrophic effects are found to be important, particularly toward the northern flank of the ACC. Relating the vertical shear of the flow to the interfacial form stress, it is shown that the vertical structure of the flow is set by a combination of the wind stress and the meridional overturning. There is, therefore, an intimate linking of the wind and thermohaline-driven circulations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ivchenko, VO","Richards, KJ","Stevens, DP"],"dc:date":"1996","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Forcing taking the form of heat and freshwater fluxes calculated using bulk aerodynamic formulae (with an effective salt flux representing freshwater forcing) failed to simulate the low salinity region in the Labrador Sea and north of the Gulf Stream. By contrast, the use of this form of surface forcing, but with direct freshwater forcing and transport instead of the more commonly used salt flux, reproduces the low salinity in these regions and gives a circulation in good agreement with that obtained using the robust diagnostic mode. Since coupled climate models currently use an artificial salt flux form for the freshwater fluxes between ocean and atmosphere, the poor performance of this surface forcing reported here has significant implications for climate prediction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wadley, MR","Bigg, GR","Stevens, DP","Johnson, JA"],"dc:date":"1996","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Their study also provides information about diverse geophysical processes, as varied as ocean circulation, air-sea fluxes, calving rates of glaciers or the mass balance of ice sheets. As a first step to obtaining this information from iceberg data we have developed a model of iceberg drift driven by ocean and atmospheric forcing derived from general circulation models. We have applied the drift model to a distribution of typical icebergs released from the main tidewater glaciers of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. We demonstrate that the main driving force of iceberg motion is rooted in the unsteady component of oceanic advection. From simulated trajectories we are able to reproduce the observed southwards limit of iceberg penetration and demonstrate sometimes surprising geographical links between iceberg origin and ultimate melting zones.

Geostrophic current velocities and transports were calculated from the temperature and salinity fields available from the atlas and compared with results from FRAM and previous studies. We have identified the Agulhas Return Front (ARF) and the Subtropical Front (STF), as well as the following fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC): the Subantarctic Front (SAP), the Polar Front (PF), and the Southern ACC Front (SACCF), from temperature and salinity characteristics and from geostrophic currents. This analysis of model and atlas data indicates that the jets associated with the ARF, STF, and SAF are topograpliically steered into a unique frontal system north of the islands, having some of the largest temperature and salinity gradients anywhere in the world ocean. The frontal jet associated with the ARF is detectable up to 75°E and has associated with it several northward branching jets. The PF bifurcates in the region of the Ob\u0027Lena (Conrad) seamount; subsurface and surface expressions are identified, separated by as much as 8° of latitude immediately west of the Kerguelen Plateau. The surface expression, carrying the bulk of the transport (∼65 Sv), is steered through the col in the Kerguelen Plateau at 56°S, 6° south of the latitude normally associated with the PF at this meridian. On crossing the plateau it rejoins the subsurface expression. In the south, passing eastward along the margin of the Antarctic continent and through the Princess Elizabeth Trough, a frontal jet is identified transporting up to 35 Sv, believed to be the SACCF [Orsi et al., 1995], placing the southern extent of the ACC in the region at 67°S.

In Drake Passage, a distinct high-3He signal is observed that is centered\r\njust above the boundary of the Lower and the Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW, UCDW), and is concentrated\r\ntowards the northern continental slope. 3He concentrations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) upstream of\r\nDrake Passage (World Ocean Circulation Experiment section P19 at 88�W) are markedly lower than those found in\r\nDrake Passage, and a regional source of primordial helium in the path of the ACC that might cause the high-3He\r\nfeature can be ruled out. We explain the feature by addition of high-3He waters present at the 43�S Pacific section. This\r\nsupports a previous, similar interpretation of a low-salinity anomaly in Drake Passage (Naveira Garabato et al., Deep-\r\nSea Research I 49 (2002) 681), that is strongly related to the high-3He feature. Employing multiparameter water mass\r\nanalysis (including 3He as a parameter), we find that deep waters as met at the 43�S Pacific section, flowing south along\r\nthe South American continental slope, contribute substantially to the ACC waters in Drake Passage (fractions exceed\r\n50% locally). Lesser, but laterally more extended contributions are found east of the Malvinas, and still smaller ones are\r\npresent at 35�W and at the Greenwich Meridian. Using velocity measurements from one of the two Drake Passage\r\nsections, we estimate the volume transport of these waters to be 7.071.2 Sv, but the average transport may be\r\nsomewhat lower as the other realization had a less pronounced signal. The enhanced 3He signature in Drake Passage is\r\nessentially confined north of the Polar Front. Further downstreamthe signature crosses this front, to the extent that at\r\n35�W the contributions south and north of it are of similar magnitude. At the same time, the 3He levels north of the\r\nfront are reduced due to a substantial admixture of low-3He North Atlantic Deep Water, such that 3He becomes highest\r\nsouth of the front. The flow of Southeast Pacific deep slope waters entering the ACC constitutes the predominant exit\r\npathway of the primordial helium released in the deep Pacific, and represents a considerable fraction of the deep water\r\nreturn flow fromthe Pacific into the ACC. Therefore and also because the density range of the added deep slope waters\r\nis intermediate between those of UCDW and LCDW, they must be considered a distinct water mass.\r\nr 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a significant warming of the warm deep water (WDW) south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC); waters are approximately 0.1°–0.2°C warmer in 1999 than 1995. This is due mainly to raised WDW potential temperatures in the Weddell Sea being fed through to the Scotia Sea as the WDW flows northeastward in the Weddell Gyre. There is a warming of the Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW) of approximately 0.05°C across the whole extent of the section, and an accompanying change in salinity that maintains the potential temperature–salinity relationship. This is caused by variability in the properties of the water overflowing the South Scotia Ridge, rather than enhanced outflow of the bottom layer of the Scotia Sea or movements of the ACC fronts, and may be related to changes in the intensity of the Weddell Gyre circulation. Consideration of other works suggests that the colder WSDW of 1995 is likely to be the anomalous case, rather than the warmer WSDW of 1999. The 1999 section reveals an inflow of Lower WSDW from east of the South Sandwich Arc via the Georgia Passage; this is constrained to the south of the southern boundary, and is not apparent in the 1995 measurements. Meanders in the southern boundary at Georgia Passage are likely to play a role in controlling the inflow of Lower WSDW, although changes in the peak density of the WSDW flowing across the South Scotia Ridge may be important also, with a denser inflow from the south acting to preclude an inflow of similar density from the northeast.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meredith, MP","Naveira Garabato, AC","Stevens, DP","Heywood, KJ","Sanders, RJ"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766137,"sim:weight":0.747853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62686,"sim:weight":0.746994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.574437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766142,"sim:weight":0.513676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766138,"sim:weight":0.479429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27273,"sim:weight":0.395905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31918,"sim:weight":0.39372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24765,"sim:weight":0.381713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32061,"sim:weight":0.354618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.344036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28847,"sim:weight":0.32597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.303617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31927,"sim:weight":0.294086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31144,"sim:weight":0.292988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26000,"sim:weight":0.291377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29454,"sim:weight":0.291086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.290457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269883,"sim:weight":0.290443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28324,"sim:weight":0.287076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.269653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Winds are derived from five different products: ERS winds that have been bin-averaged, weekly gridded ERS winds produced by the Centre ERS d\u0027Archivage et de Traitement, 5 day winds from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager, analysis winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and reanalysis winds from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Barotropic transport is estimated from the pressure difference between bottom pressure gauges deployed on either side of Drake Passage by Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment. Surface transport is estimated from TOPEX altimetry. Results indicate that transport and wind forcing are coherent over a broad range of frequencies, corresponding to time periods of roughly 10–256 days. Highest coherences occur for winds at latitudes on the south side of Drake Passage. Barotropic ocean transport lags wind forcing not by a constant time interval but by a constant phase lag of about one eighteenth of a cycle at a broad range of frequencies, suggesting that the oceanic response to wind is controlled by both the tendency term and a frequency-dependent viscous process. Surface transport lags by a longer phase interval. Wind stress curl north of Drake Passage is more coherent with transport than is wind stress curl in the latitudes of Drake Passage. Ocean transport lags wind stress curl, suggesting that transport fluctuations are not governed by a simple Sverdrupian vorticity balance. Like the observations, general circulation model transports from the Parallel Ocean Program and from the Parallel Ocean Climate Model are coherent with wind stress from the south side of Drake Passage and with wind stress curl from latitudes north of Drake Passage. Unlike the observations, model transport and bottom pressure vary almost simultaneously with the wind and do not replicate the observed phase lags, implying that the effective model viscosity may be too large.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gille, ST","Stevens, DP","Tokmakian, RT","Heywood, KJ"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Regression calculations show that the submonthly (30-day high-pass filtered) surface wind variability is significantly modulated during the MJO. Regions of increased (decreased) submonthly surface wind variability propagate eastward, approximately in phase with the intraseasonal surface westerly (easterly) anomalies of the MJO. Due to the dependence of the surface latent heat flux on the magnitude of the total wind speed, this systematic modulation of the submonthly surface wind variability produces a significant component in the intraseasonal latent heat flux anomalies, which partially cancels the latent heat flux anomalies due to the slowly varying intraseasonal wind anomalies, particularly south of 10S. A method is derived that demodulates the submonthly surface wind variability from the slowly varying intraseasonal wind anomalies. This method is applied to the wind forcing fields of a one-dimensional ocean model. The model response to this modified forcing produces larger intraseasonal SST anomalies than when the model is forced with the observed forcing over large areas of the southwest Pacific Ocean and southeast Indian Ocean during both phases of the MJO. This result has implications for accurate coupled modeling of the MJO. A similar calculation is applied to the surface shortwave flux, but intraseasonal modulation of submonthly surface shortwave flux variability does not appear to be important to the dynamics of the MJO.","bibo:AuthorList":["Batstone, CP","Matthews, AJ","Stevens, DP"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2772852,"sim:weight":0.69651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767047,"sim:weight":0.592086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768886,"sim:weight":0.591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772851,"sim:weight":0.582214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771088,"sim:weight":0.567872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771792,"sim:weight":0.554811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769392,"sim:weight":0.552256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769372,"sim:weight":0.507167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771411,"sim:weight":0.497667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29494,"sim:weight":0.493595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772854,"sim:weight":0.483109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.470301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27356,"sim:weight":0.469516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772847,"sim:weight":0.458182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32133,"sim:weight":0.453861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31869,"sim:weight":0.452211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30697,"sim:weight":0.449272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.435144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31910,"sim:weight":0.426834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30700,"sim:weight":0.413601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study region includes the southern part of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the northern Weddell Gyre. Despite similar formulations, the models have different strengths and weaknesses. OCCAM simulates well the horizontal circulation around South Georgia but loss of Antarctic Bottom Water distorts the mean circulation in the central Scotia Sea. A poorer bathymetric dataset in POCM_4C means that the circulation is not adequately topographically steered leading to greater zonal flow and a southward shift of the fronts of the southern ACC. In a comparison with sea surface height variability data, OCCAM overestimates and POCM_4C underestimates the maximum values. Both models have higher background variability than the satellite data. Mean monthly model output is compared with a meridional hydrographic section from the study region. The regional water masses at the time of the hydrographic section (April 1995) are recognisably reproduced in both models despite some discrepancies. The surface waters are too saline in OCCAM (by 0.12–0.40) and too warm in POCM_4C (by \u003e2 °C) suggesting problems with the air-sea surface heat and freshwater fluxes used to force both models and the models\u0027 vertical mixing parameterisations. Anomalous mixed layer properties in winter lead to inaccurate Winter Water characteristics in both models. Slumping of Circumpolar Deep Water occurs in OCCAM, associated with the loss of the bottom water. Subsurface restoration to climatology at buffer zones prevents this slumping in POCM_4C although the densest waters are not reproduced. The models overestimate the baroclinic transport of the section by up to a factor of two and simulate a significant barotropic component of transport. Overall, both models can be used in this region in ways that utilise their strengths. Further improvements are likely to come from better bathymetric representations, surface fluxes, and bottom water formation processes, elimination of spurious diapycnal mixing, improvement of vertical mixing parameterisations, and higher resolution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thorpe, S","Stevens, DP","Heywood, KJ"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766137,"sim:weight":0.566099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766142,"sim:weight":0.53678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.524884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766123,"sim:weight":0.518341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27273,"sim:weight":0.502857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766152,"sim:weight":0.469462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766155,"sim:weight":0.46642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766157,"sim:weight":0.46514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31146,"sim:weight":0.460831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30695,"sim:weight":0.45775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31918,"sim:weight":0.450118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24765,"sim:weight":0.449087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28620,"sim:weight":0.439181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28135,"sim:weight":0.431242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269883,"sim:weight":0.428079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32061,"sim:weight":0.413963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28847,"sim:weight":0.406394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31150,"sim:weight":0.397368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.391779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33802,"sim:weight":0.389917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Localized increases in chlorophyll concentration measured in the wake of bathymetric features near South Georgia demonstrate variations in the factors governing the HNLC condition. We explore the possibility that the contrast between these areas of high-chlorophyll and surrounding HNLC areas is associated with variations in phytoplankton photophysiology. Total dissolvable iron concentrations, phytoplankton photophysiology and community structure were investigated in late April 2003 on a transect along the North Scotia Ridge (53–54°S) between the Falkland Islands and South Georgia (58–33°W). Total dissolvable iron concentrations suggested a benthic source of iron near South Georgia. Bulk community measurements of dark-adapted photochemical quantum efficiency (F v/F m) exhibited a sharp increase to the east of 46°W coincident with a decrease in the functional absorption cross-section (σPSII). Phytoplankton populations east of 46°W thus displayed no physiological symptoms of iron or nitrate stress. Contrasting low F v/F m west of 46°W could not be explained by variations in the macronutrients nitrate and silicic acid and may be the result of taxon specific variability in photophysiology or iron stress. We hypothesize that increased F v/F m resulted from local relief from iron-stress near South Georgia, east of Aurora Bank, an area previously speculated to be a “pulse point” source of iron. Our measurements provide one of the first direct physiological confirmations that iron stress is alleviated in phytoplankton populations near South Georgia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holeton, CL","Nédélec, F","Sanders, R","Brown, L","Moore, CM","Stevens, DP","Heywood, KJ","Statham, PJ","Lucas, CH"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2767706,"sim:weight":0.52271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The North Tropical Atlantic","bibo:abstract":"The interannual variability of the tropical Atlantic ocean-atmosphere system is examined using 50 years of sea-surface temperature (SST) and re-analysis data, and satellite data when available. A singular value decomposition analysis of 12- to 72-month bandpass filtered SST and zonal wind stress reveals two dominant modes of interannual variability. The SST anomalies are confined to the North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) in the first mode and extend over the equatorial and South Tropical Atlantic in the second mode. No evidence is found for an Atlantic SST dipole. The structure of the first (NTA) mode is examined in detail here, while the second mode has been described in a companion paper. In particular, the relationship of the NTA mode with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is investigated. There are 12 NTA events (seven warm and five cold) that are associated with ENSO, and 18 NTA events (seven warm and 11 cold) that are independent of ENSO.\r\n\r\nThe ENSO-associated NTA events appear to be a passive response to remote ENSO forcing, mainly via a Pacific-North America (PNA)-like wave train that induces SST anomalies over the NTA through changes in the surface wind and latent heat flux. The NTA anomalies peak four months after ENSO. There does not appear to be an atmospheric response to the NTA SST anomalies as convection over the Atlantic is suppressed by the anomalous Walker circulation due to ENSO.\r\n\r\nThe ENSO-independent NTA events also appear to be induced by an extratropical wave train from the Pacific sector (but one that is independent of Pacific SST), and forcing by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) also contributes. As the event matures, the atmosphere does respond to the NTA SST anomalies, with enhanced convection over the Caribbean and a wave train that propagates northeastward to Europe.","bibo:AuthorList":["Handoh, IC","Matthews, AJ","Bigg, GR","Stevens, DP"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.639441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31927,"sim:weight":0.627888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30697,"sim:weight":0.597642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31928,"sim:weight":0.570392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31920,"sim:weight":0.557419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32133,"sim:weight":0.500065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30700,"sim:weight":0.498974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31932,"sim:weight":0.497671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.47675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772852,"sim:weight":0.471711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27635,"sim:weight":0.461514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.456524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31926,"sim:weight":0.456472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27259,"sim:weight":0.444081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29494,"sim:weight":0.443716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31918,"sim:weight":0.423146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31931,"sim:weight":0.419186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.406742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31937,"sim:weight":0.389397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":490666,"sim:weight":0.387003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this paper we focus on the STA mode that covers the equatorial and sub-tropical South Atlantic. We show that STA events occurring in conjunction with ENSO have a preference for the southern summer season and seem to be forced by an atmospheric wave train emanating from the central tropical Pacific and travelling via South America, in addition to the more direct ENSO-induced change in the Walker circulation. They are lagged by one season from the peak of ENSO. These events show little evidence for other-than-localised coupled ocean-atmosphere interaction.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, STA events occurring in the absence of ENSO favour the southern winter season. They appear to be triggered by a Southern Hemisphere wave train emanating from the Pacific sector, and then exhibit features of a self-sustaining climate mode in the tropical Atlantic. The southward shift of the inter tropical convergence zone that occurs during the warm phase of such an event triggers an extra tropical wave train that propagates downstream in the Southern Hemisphere. We present a unified view of the NTA and STA modes through our observational analysis of the interannnual tropical Atlantic variability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Handoh, I","Bigg, GR","Matthews, AJ","Stevens, DP"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2772852,"sim:weight":0.482565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here, it is demonstrated that these two models can be viewed\r\nas opposite limits of a single theory. Stommel’s model represents unlimited diapycnal mixing, whereas the thermocline\r\nscaling represents weak mixing. The latter limit is more applicable to the modern ocean, and previous studies suggest\r\nthat it is associated with a more stable THC. A new box model, which can operate near either limit, is developed to\r\nenable explicit analysis of the transient behaviour. The model is perturbed from equilibrium with an increase in surface\r\nfreshwater forcing, and initially behaves as if the only feedbacks are those present in Stommel’s model. The response\r\nis buffered by any upper ocean horizontal mixing, then by propagation of salinity anomalies, each of which are stabilizing\r\nmechanisms. However, negative feedback associated with limited diapycnal mixing only prevents thermohaline\r\ncatastrophe in a modest parameter domain. This is because the time-scale associated with vertical advective-diffusive\r\nbalance is much longer than the time required for the THC to change mode. The model is then tuned to allow equilibrium\r\nTHC transport to be independent of the rate of mixing. The equilibrium surface salinity difference controls the classical\r\nTHC-transport/salinity positive feedback, whereas the equilibrium interior density difference controls the mean-flow\r\nnegative feedback. When mixing is strong, unrealistic vertical homogenization occurs, causing a convergence in surface\r\nand interior meridional gradients. This reduces positive feedback, and increases stability, in the tuned model. Therefore,\r\nStommel’s model appears to overestimate, rather than underestimate, THC stability to high-frequency changes in\r\nforcing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Oliver, KIC","Watson, AJ","Stevens, DP"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85030,"sim:weight":0.615245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27386,"sim:weight":0.594081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2678531,"sim:weight":0.545083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4392,"sim:weight":0.519211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27273,"sim:weight":0.51258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32064,"sim:weight":0.507453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30695,"sim:weight":0.507028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000100,"sim:weight":0.501368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":481859,"sim:weight":0.493844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269883,"sim:weight":0.470714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28135,"sim:weight":0.467185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29454,"sim:weight":0.464797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1098230,"sim:weight":0.451133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24808,"sim:weight":0.450754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26000,"sim:weight":0.42596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271218,"sim:weight":0.419496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30700,"sim:weight":0.41806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27356,"sim:weight":0.412165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.400791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28324,"sim:weight":0.397848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The decomposition requires the following information: 1) a density profile wherever bathymetry changes to construct the vertical shears component, 2) the zonal-mean zonal wind stress for the Ekman component, and 3) the mean depth-independent velocity information over each isobath to construct the external mode. The decomposition is applied to the third-generation Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere General Circulation Model (HadCM3) to determine the meridional variability of these individual components within the Atlantic Ocean. The external mode component is shown to be extremely important where western boundary currents impinge on topography, and also in the area of the overflows. The Sverdrup balance explains the shape of the external mode MOC component to first order, but the time variability of the external mode exhibits only a very weak dependence on the wind stress curl. Thus, the Sverdrup balance cannot be used to determine the external mode changes when examining temporal change in the MOC. The vertical shears component allows the time-mean and the time-variable upper North Atlantic MOC cell to be deduced at 25°S and 50°N. A stronger dependency on the external mode and Ekman components between 8° and 35°N and in the regions of the overflows means that hydrographic sections need to be supplemented by bottom pressure and wind stress information at these latitudes. At the decadal time scale, variability in Ekman transport is less important than that in geostrophic shears. In the Southern Hemisphere the vertical shears component is dominant at all time scales, suggesting that hydrographic sections alone may be suitable for deducing change in the MOC at these latitudes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sime, LC","Stevens, DP","Heywood, KJ","Oliver, KIC"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930628,"sim:weight":0.601391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31927,"sim:weight":0.558786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28324,"sim:weight":0.538729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31146,"sim:weight":0.530919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269886,"sim:weight":0.506431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271214,"sim:weight":0.494321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30700,"sim:weight":0.481611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28620,"sim:weight":0.474258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.472312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30697,"sim:weight":0.460598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27273,"sim:weight":0.455713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29454,"sim:weight":0.455494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30695,"sim:weight":0.452903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269883,"sim:weight":0.449212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24765,"sim:weight":0.44609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":666644,"sim:weight":0.443852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31934,"sim:weight":0.429744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31932,"sim:weight":0.42708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.426789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31933,"sim:weight":0.424467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Owing to sparse sampling of the northern and southern boundaries of the basin, the modification and pathways of deep water masses in the Scotia Sea had remained poorly documented despite their global significance.\r\n\r\nWeddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW) of two distinct types is observed spilling over the South Scotia Ridge to the west and east of the western edge of the Orkney Passage. The colder and fresher type in the west, recently ventilated in the northern Antarctic Peninsula, flows westward to Drake Passage along the southern margin of the Scotia Sea while mixing intensely with eastward-flowing Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) of the antarctic circumpolar current (ACC). Although a small fraction of the other WSDW type also spreads westward to Drake Passage, the greater part escapes the Scotia Sea eastward through the Georgia Passage and flows into the Malvinas Chasm via a deep gap northeast of South Georgia. A more saline WSDW variety from the South Sandwich Trench may leak into the eastern Scotia Sea through Georgia Passage, but mainly flows around the Northeast Georgia Rise to the northern Georgia Basin.\r\n\r\nIn Drake Passage, the inflowing CDW displays a previously unreported bimodal property distribution, with CDW at the Subantarctic Front receiving a contribution of deep water from the subtropical Pacific. This bimodality is eroded away in the Scotia Sea by vigorous mixing with WSDW and CDW from the Weddell Gyre. The extent of ventilation follows a zonation that can be related to the CDW pathways and the frontal anatomy of the ACC. Between the Southern Boundary of the ACC and the Southern ACC Front, CDW cools by 0.15°C and freshens by 0.015 along isopycnals. The body of CDW in the region of the Polar Front splits after overflowing the North Scotia Ridge, with a fraction following the front south of the Falkland Plateau and another spilling over the plateau near 49.5°W. Its cooling (by 0.07°C) and freshening (by 0.008) in crossing the Scotia Sea is counteracted locally by NADW entraining southward near the Maurice Ewing Bank. CDW also overflows the North Scotia Ridge by following the Subantarctic Front through a passage just east of Burdwood Bank, and spills over the Falkland Plateau near 53°W with decreased potential temperature (by 0.03°C) and salinity (by 0.004). As a result of ventilation by Weddell Sea waters, the signature of the Southeast Pacific Deep Water (SPDW) fraction of CDW is largely erased in the Scotia Sea. A modified form of SPDW is detected escaping the sea via two distinct routes only: following the Southern ACC Front through Georgia Passage; and skirting the eastern end of the Falkland Plateau after flowing through Shag Rocks Passage.","bibo:AuthorList":["Naveira Garabato, AC","Heywood, KJ","Stevens, DP"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766116,"sim:weight":0.747853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62686,"sim:weight":0.685792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766155,"sim:weight":0.68301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766142,"sim:weight":0.596965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766138,"sim:weight":0.59472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766121,"sim:weight":0.566099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.488657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766157,"sim:weight":0.487431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24765,"sim:weight":0.445853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27273,"sim:weight":0.44527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.408335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28847,"sim:weight":0.39982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32061,"sim:weight":0.392882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33801,"sim:weight":0.379556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269883,"sim:weight":0.347271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31146,"sim:weight":0.335627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31927,"sim:weight":0.335063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.33335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761092,"sim:weight":0.323548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29454,"sim:weight":0.317577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One is associated with the Subantarctic Front (SAF; 52 ± 6 Sv), and the other two with branches of the Polar Front (PF) over the sill of the Falkland Plateau (44 ± 9 Sv) and in the northwestern Georgia Basin (45 ± 9 Sv). The latter includes a local reinforcement (20 Sv) by a deep anticyclonic recirculation around the Maurice Ewing Bank. While the classical hydrographic signature of the PF stands out in this eastbound branch, it is less distinguishable in the northbound branch over the plateau. Other circulation features are a southward entrainment of diluted North Atlantic Deep Water from the Argentine Basin over the eastern part of the Falkland Plateau, and an abyssal anticyclonic flow in the western Georgia Basin, opposite to what was generally assumed.\r\n\r\nThe different behavior of the SAF and PF at the Falkland Plateau (no structural modification of the former and partitioning of the latter) is attributed to the PF being deeper than the sill depth on the upstream side of the plateau, unlike the SAF. It is suggested that the partitioning takes place at a location where the 2500-m and 3000-m isobaths diverge at the southern edge of the plateau. The western branch of the PF crosses the plateau at a distance of 250 km to the east of the SAF. Comparison with a section across the Falkland Current farther downstream shows that its deep part subsequently joins the SAF on the northern side of the plateau where the 2000–3000 m isobaths converge in the steep Falkland Escarpment. The result of this two-stage bathymetric effect is a net transfer of at least 10 Sv from the PF to the SAF at the crossing of the Falkland Plateau.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arhan, M","Naveira Garabato, AC","Heywood, KJ","Stevens, DP"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766155,"sim:weight":0.608073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766137,"sim:weight":0.59472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766157,"sim:weight":0.570879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766142,"sim:weight":0.501699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24765,"sim:weight":0.485001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766116,"sim:weight":0.479429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27273,"sim:weight":0.472569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.471948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32061,"sim:weight":0.401547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28324,"sim:weight":0.39702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28847,"sim:weight":0.388895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269886,"sim:weight":0.372517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26679,"sim:weight":0.370874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31927,"sim:weight":0.369844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29454,"sim:weight":0.366851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29433,"sim:weight":0.36339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26000,"sim:weight":0.35378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495164,"sim:weight":0.347434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931226,"sim:weight":0.345309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.341595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There is a pattern of northward (southward) flow on the western (eastern) side of each of four deep passages in the ridge, which is supported by tracer measurements. The net full-depth LADCP-referenced geostrophic transport over the ridge is 22±7 Sv (1 Sv\u003d106 m3 s−1) northward, with the jets on either side of the passages transporting 5–10 Sv in alternating directions. The corresponding Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW) transport over the ridge is 6.7±1.7 Sv. This is a factor of 4 larger than the only previous estimate in the literature, and suggests that a significant proportion of the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) invading the world ocean abyss escapes the Weddell Sea via the Scotia Sea.\r\n\r\nThe net full-depth and WSDW transports over the ridge are modified to 7±6 and 4.7±0.7 Sv, respectively, by a box inverse model of the western Weddell Gyre. The model incorporates the WOCE A23 crossing of the central part of the gyre and a set of five constraints synthesizing our previous oceanographic knowledge of the region. It diagnoses that 9.7±3.7 Sv of AABW are formed in the Weddell Sea, and that comparable amounts are exported over the South Scotia Ridge (48%) and further east (52%) assuming that no AABW enters the Weddell Gyre from the Indian Ocean. The WSDW fraction with neutral density γn\u003e28.31 kg m−3transported over the ridge upwells in the Scotia Sea at a rate of 6×10−6 m s−1, an order of magnitude larger than many basin-scale estimates of deep upwelling in the literature. In contrast, the Weddell Sea Bottom Water exported to the eastern Weddell Gyre entrains upward at a rate of 8×10−7 m s−1, more typical of other open-ocean regions. When their different ventilation histories are considered, the comparable transports and disparate upwelling rates of the AABW exported over the South Scotia Ridge and farther east may be crucial to our understanding of teleconnections between the Weddell Sea and the global ocean.","bibo:AuthorList":["Naveira Garabato, AC","McDonagh, EL","Stevens, DP","Heywood, KJ","Sanders, RJ"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766157,"sim:weight":0.483292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766154,"sim:weight":0.337981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771807,"sim:weight":0.331722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The southern ACC front (SACCF), one of three major fronts associated with the ACC, wraps anticyclonically around South Georgia and then retroflects north of the island. This paper investigates temporal variability in the position of the SACCF north of South Georgia that is likely to have an effect on the South Georgia ecosystem by contributing to the variability in local krill abundance.\r\n\r\nA meridional hydrographic section that crossed the SACCF three times demonstrates that the SACCF is associated with a geopotential anomaly of 4.5 J kg−1 in the eastern Scotia Sea. A high resolution (1/4°×1/4°) map of historical geopotential anomaly shows the mean position of the SACCF retroflection north of South Georgia to be at 36°W, 400 km further east than in previous work. It also reveals temporal variability associated with the SACCF in the South Georgia region. A near-surface drifter provides evidence for variability in the western extent of the SACCF north of South Georgia and for the presence of eddies in the region. Output from a 3-year (1993–1995) high frequency wind forced run of the eddy-permitting Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling project (OCCAM) model, used to investigate the frontal variability, shows two periods of anomalous westward extent of the SACCF north of South Georgia and associated eddy-shedding.

In Drake Passage, a distinct high-3He signal is observed that is centered\r\njust above the boundary of the Lower and the Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW, UCDW), and is concentrated\r\ntowards the northern continental slope. 3He concentrations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) upstream of\r\nDrake Passage (World Ocean Circulation Experiment section P19 at 88�W) are markedly lower than those found in\r\nDrake Passage, and a regional source of primordial helium in the path of the ACC that might cause the high-3He\r\nfeature can be ruled out. We explain the feature by addition of high-3He waters present at the 43�S Pacific section. This\r\nsupports a previous, similar interpretation of a low-salinity anomaly in Drake Passage (Naveira Garabato et al., Deep-\r\nSea Research I 49 (2002) 681), that is strongly related to the high-3He feature. Employing multiparameter water mass\r\nanalysis (including 3He as a parameter), we find that deep waters as met at the 43�S Pacific section, flowing south along\r\nthe South American continental slope, contribute substantially to the ACC waters in Drake Passage (fractions exceed\r\n50% locally). Lesser, but laterally more extended contributions are found east of the Malvinas, and still smaller ones are\r\npresent at 35�W and at the Greenwich Meridian. Using velocity measurements from one of the two Drake Passage\r\nsections, we estimate the volume transport of these waters to be 7.071.2 Sv, but the average transport may be\r\nsomewhat lower as the other realization had a less pronounced signal. The enhanced 3He signature in Drake Passage is\r\nessentially confined north of the Polar Front. Further downstreamthe signature crosses this front, to the extent that at\r\n35�W the contributions south and north of it are of similar magnitude. At the same time, the 3He levels north of the\r\nfront are reduced due to a substantial admixture of low-3He North Atlantic Deep Water, such that 3He becomes highest\r\nsouth of the front. The flow of Southeast Pacific deep slope waters entering the ACC constitutes the predominant exit\r\npathway of the primordial helium released in the deep Pacific, and represents a considerable fraction of the deep water\r\nreturn flow fromthe Pacific into the ACC. Therefore and also because the density range of the added deep slope waters\r\nis intermediate between those of UCDW and LCDW, they must be considered a distinct water mass.\r\nr 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The model provides an estimate of the time-mean three-dimensional circulation as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) crosses the region. It concurrently solves for geostrophic and wind-driven Ekman transports across the boundaries of the basin, air–sea-driven diapycnal fluxes, and “interior” diapycnal fluxes below the ocean surface. An increase is diagnosed in the ACC volume transport from 143 ± 13 Sv (Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1) at Drake Passage to 149 ± 16 Sv on leaving the Scotia Sea, supplied by the import of 5.9 ± 1.7 Sv of Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW) over the South Scotia Ridge. There is a lateral redistribution of the transport, primarily in response to a topographically induced branching of the 70–80 Sv polar front (PF) jet and an increase in the transport associated with the subantarctic front (SAF) from 31 ± 7 to 48 ± 4 Sv. A vertical rearrangement of the transport also occurs, with differences O(2 Sv) in the transports of intermediate and deep water masses. These volume transport changes are accompanied by a net reduction (increase) in the heat (freshwater) flux associated with the ACC by 0.02 ± 0.020 PW (0.020 ± 0.017 Sv), the main cause of which is the cooling and freshening of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) layer in the Scotia Sea. The model suggests that the Scotia Sea hosts intense diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior extending 1500–2000 m above the rough topography of the basin. Despite these model results, no evidence is found for a significant diapycnal link between the upper and lower classes of CDW (and hence between the “shallow” and “deep” cells of the Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation). On the contrary, the boundary between Upper and Lower CDW separates two distinct regimes of diapycnal mixing involving volume fluxes of 1–3 Sv. Whereas in the denser waters topographic mixing is important, in lighter layers air–sea-driven diapycnal volume fluxes are dominant and diapycnal transfers of heat and freshwater are mainly effected by upper-ocean mixing processes. The model indicates that the ventilation of the deep ACC in the Scotia Sea is driven primarily by isopycnal exchanges with the northern Weddell Sea and to a lesser extent by diapycnal mixing with WSDW. The model reveals the existence of a mesoscale eddy-driven overturning circulation across the ACC core involving an isopycnal poleward transport of 8 ± 1 Sv of CDW and an equatorward transport of intermediate water of the same magnitude. This circulation induces a cross-ACC poleward heat flux of 0.022 ± 0.009 PW and an equatorward freshwater flux of 0.02 ± 0.01 Sv. Adequately scaled, the former compares favorably to measurements of the cross-stream eddy heat flux by moored current meters and floats in the ACC and to budget estimates of the circumpolar cross-ACC heat flux.","bibo:AuthorList":["Naveira Garabato, AC","Stevens, DP","Heywood, KJ"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766157,"sim:weight":0.680869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27273,"sim:weight":0.663203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771807,"sim:weight":0.633736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001917,"sim:weight":0.633233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766137,"sim:weight":0.596965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766155,"sim:weight":0.543238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766121,"sim:weight":0.53678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31146,"sim:weight":0.534382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766116,"sim:weight":0.513676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32061,"sim:weight":0.513043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.507637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766138,"sim:weight":0.501699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29454,"sim:weight":0.498936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766154,"sim:weight":0.488609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28324,"sim:weight":0.485127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28847,"sim:weight":0.471972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269883,"sim:weight":0.466535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24808,"sim:weight":0.464763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766152,"sim:weight":0.455898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.449308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Antarctic Coastal Current flows over the Antarctic continental shelf and is not tied to a particular isobath. It transports ∼1 Sv westward to the Bransfield Strait. Its subsequent course is uncertain, but we speculate that it may continue southwest along the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula, close to the coast. The Antarctic Slope Front, present almost all the way around Antarctica tied to the continental slope, has not previously been mapped after it reaches the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. We show that the frontal jet splits into two branches in the northwest Powell Basin where the isobaths diverge. The shoreward portion of the water associated with the front (lying above isobaths shallower than 1500 m) is able to cross the South Scotia Ridge and head northwestward and retains many of the properties of the Antarctic Slope Front. It is associated with a transport of ∼7 Sv. The portion of the front constrained to lie above isobaths deeper than 1500 m becomes the Weddell Front. This takes a path around the northern Powell Basin and south of the South Orkney Islands. Of the ∼13 Sv that circulates around the southern flank of the South Orkney Plateau, ∼8 Sv of Weddell Sea Deep Water and Warm Deep Water leaves the front to continue west. The remaining shallow and intermediate water retroflects and returns south associated with the Weddell Front through the Orkney Passage.

In HiGEM, the horizontal resolution has been increased to 0.83° latitude × 1.25° longitude for the atmosphere, and 1/3° × 1/3° globally for the ocean. Multidecadal integrations of HiGEM, and the lower-resolution HadGEM, are used to explore the impact of resolution on the fidelity of climate simulations.\r\n\r\nGenerally, SST errors are reduced in HiGEM. Cold SST errors associated with the path of the North Atlantic drift improve, and warm SST errors are reduced in upwelling stratocumulus regions where the simulation of low-level cloud is better at higher resolution. The ocean model in HiGEM allows ocean eddies to be partially resolved, which dramatically improves the representation of sea surface height variability. In the Southern Ocean, most of the heat transports in HiGEM is achieved by resolved eddy motions, which replaces the parameterized eddy heat transport in the lower-resolution model. HiGEM is also able to more realistically simulate small-scale features in the wind stress curl around islands and oceanic SST fronts, which may have implications for oceanic upwelling and ocean biology.\r\n\r\nHigher resolution in both the atmosphere and the ocean allows coupling to occur on small spatial scales. In particular, the small-scale interaction recently seen in satellite imagery between the atmosphere and tropical instability waves in the tropical Pacific Ocean is realistically captured in HiGEM. Tropical instability waves play a role in improving the simulation of the mean state of the tropical Pacific, which has important implications for climate variability. In particular, all aspects of the simulation of ENSO (spatial patterns, the time scales at which ENSO occurs, and global teleconnections) are much improved in HiGEM.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shaffrey, LC","Stevens, I","Norton, WA","Roberts, MJ","Vidale, PL","Harle, JD","Jrrar, A","Stevens, DP","Woodage, MJ","Demory, ME","Donners, J","Clark, DB","Clayton, A","Cole, JW","Wilson, SS","Connolley, WM","Davies, TM","Iwi, AM","Johns, TC","King, JC","New, AL","Slingo, JM","Slingo, A","Steenman-Clark, L","Martin, GM"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1175/2008JCLI2508.1","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766153,"sim:weight":0.746932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766167,"sim:weight":0.684845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1053795,"sim:weight":0.672349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":980364,"sim:weight":0.654142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":481859,"sim:weight":0.638842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1098228,"sim:weight":0.596821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773323,"sim:weight":0.583197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":481862,"sim:weight":0.571522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":744519,"sim:weight":0.564298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1053854,"sim:weight":0.543249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771201,"sim:weight":0.54226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2781458,"sim:weight":0.540346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768036,"sim:weight":0.505695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9441553,"sim:weight":0.497004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772411,"sim:weight":0.490654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773322,"sim:weight":0.489743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766121,"sim:weight":0.469462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":886062,"sim:weight":0.461789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766142,"sim:weight":0.455898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":833998,"sim:weight":0.448588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The mean state of the tropical Pacific is found to be improved in the models with a higher ocean resolution. Such an improved mean state arises from the development of tropical instability waves, which are poorly resolved at low resolution; these waves reduce the equatorial cold tongue bias. The improved ocean state also allows for a better simulation of the atmospheric Walker circulation.\r\n\r\nSeveral sensitivity studies have been performed to further understand the processes involved in the different component models. Significantly decreasing the horizontal momentum dissipation in the coupled model with the lower-resolution ocean has benefits for the mean tropical Pacific climate, but decreases model stability. Increasing the momentum dissipation in the coupled model with the higher-resolution ocean degrades the simulation toward that of the lower-resolution ocean.\r\n\r\nThese results suggest that enhanced ocean model resolution can have important benefits for the climatology of both the atmosphere and ocean components of the coupled model, and that some of these benefits may be achievable at lower ocean resolution, if the model formulation allows.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roberts, MJ","Clayton, A","Demory, M-E","Donners, J","Vidale, PL","Norton, W","Shaffrey, L","Stevens, DP","Stevens, I","Wood, RA","Slingo, J"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766167,"sim:weight":0.753223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766152,"sim:weight":0.746932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28135,"sim:weight":0.675594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28620,"sim:weight":0.652968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31934,"sim:weight":0.636041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30695,"sim:weight":0.633551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30700,"sim:weight":0.589175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":980377,"sim:weight":0.585707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29494,"sim:weight":0.580614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30697,"sim:weight":0.574817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31869,"sim:weight":0.572342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":481859,"sim:weight":0.568075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.560307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31937,"sim:weight":0.548985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.5387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31933,"sim:weight":0.535287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1053795,"sim:weight":0.532934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31927,"sim:weight":0.52517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27356,"sim:weight":0.518343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1098230,"sim:weight":0.516045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both water masses have experienced substantial variability on interannual to interdecadal time scales. SAMW is formed by winter overturning on the equatorward flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in and to the west of the Drake Passage. Its interannual variability is primarily driven by variations in wintertime air–sea turbulent heat fluxes and net evaporation modulated by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Despite their spatial proximity, the AAIW in the Drake Passage has a very different source than that of the SAMW because it is ventilated by the northward subduction of Winter Water originating in the Bellingshausen Sea. Changes in AAIW are mainly forced by variability in Winter Water properties resulting from fluctuations in wintertime air–sea turbulent heat fluxes and spring sea ice melting, both of which are linked to predominantly ENSO-driven variations in the intensity of meridional winds to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula. A prominent exception to the prevalent modes of SAMW and AAIW formation occurred in 1998, when strong wind forcing associated with constructive interference between ENSO and the southern annular mode (SAM) triggered a transitory shift to an Ekman-dominated mode of SAMW ventilation and a 1–2-yr shutdown of AAIW production.\r\n\r\nThe interdecadal evolutions of SAMW and AAIW in the Drake Passage are distinct and driven by different processes. SAMW warmed (by 0.3°C) and salinified (by 0.04) during the 1970s and experienced the reverse trends between 1990 and 2005, when the coldest and freshest SAMW on record was observed. In contrast, AAIW underwent a net freshening (by 0.05) between the 1970s and the twenty-first century. Although the reversing changes in SAMW were chiefly forced by a 30-yr oscillation in regional air–sea turbulent heat fluxes and precipitation associated with the interdecadal Pacific oscillation, with a SAM-driven intensification of the Ekman supply of Antarctic surface waters from the south contributing significantly too, the freshening of AAIW was linked to the extreme climate change that occurred to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades. There, a freshening of the Winter Water ventilating AAIW was brought about by increased precipitation and a retreat of the winter sea ice edge, which were seemingly forced by an interdecadal trend in the SAM and regional positive feedbacks in the air–sea ice coupled climate system. All in all, these findings highlight the role of the major modes of Southern Hemisphere climate variability in driving the evolution of SAMW and AAIW in the Drake Passage region and the wider South Atlantic and suggest that these modes may have contributed significantly to the hemispheric-scale changes undergone by those waters in recent decades.","bibo:AuthorList":["Naveira Garabato, AC","Jullion, L","Stevens, DP","Heywood, KJ","King, BA"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2781458,"sim:weight":0.573204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766157,"sim:weight":0.553268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766166,"sim:weight":0.53405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768036,"sim:weight":0.519872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766142,"sim:weight":0.488609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495342,"sim:weight":0.477826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771201,"sim:weight":0.431138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.421547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768928,"sim:weight":0.369661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771807,"sim:weight":0.345543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766139,"sim:weight":0.337981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773358,"sim:weight":0.319617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":744504,"sim:weight":0.306096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Analysis of thermohaline properties of hydrographic sections in the BMC reveals strong interactions between the ACC and subtropical fronts. In the Subantarctic Front, Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW), Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), and Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) warm (become saltier) by 0.4° (0.08), 0.3° (0.02), and 0.6°C (0.1), respectively.

A high resolution configuration of the same model has a much improved response that is similar to observations. The errors in the low resolution model are traced to an incorrect representation of the atmospheric teleconnection mechanism that controls the extra-tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during El Nino. This is due to an unrealistic atmospheric mean state, which changes the propagation characteristics of Rossby waves. These erroneous upper tropospheric circulation anomalies then induce erroneous surface circulation features over the North Pacific. The associated surface wind speed and direction errors create erroneous surface flux and upwelling anomalies which finally lead to the incorrect extra-tropical SST response to El Nino in the low resolution model.

In this paper we examine the electricity sectors of Germany, Greece, Poland and the UK in an attempt to identify the policy and technology choices implemented in each country. The country selection is deliberately made to facilitate an extended overview of national agendas, varying domestic energy resources and industrialisation levels but still within the common EU framework. The focus is placed on policies related to two objectives, climate change mitigation and improving electricity supply security. The theoretical framework developed provides the possibility to assess the electricity sector independence at a national level using a multi-parametric analysis of the fuel mix data.

The T4Dnl (T4 DNA ligase) and two RNA ligases [T4Rnl1 (T4 RNA ligase 1) and T4Rnl2] join a diverse array of substrates, including nicks that are present in double-stranded nucleic acids, albeit with different efficiencies. To unravel the biochemical and functional relationship between these proteins, a systematic analysis of their substrate specificity was performed using recombinant proteins. The ability of each protein to ligate 20 bp double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a single-strand break was determined. Between 4 and 37 Â°C, all proteins ligated substrates containing various combinations of DNA and RNA. The RNA ligases ligated a more diverse set of substrates than T4Dnl and, generally, T4Rnl1 had 50-1000-fold lower activity than T4Rnl2. In assays using identical conditions, optimal ligation of all substrates was at pH 8 for T4Dnl and T4Rnl1 and pH 7 for T4Rnl2, demonstrating that the protein dictates the pH optimum for ligation. All proteins ligated a substrate containing DNA as the unbroken strand, with the nucleotides at the nick of the broken strand being RNA at the 3\u0027-hydroxy group and DNA at the 5\u0027-phosphate. Since this RNA-DNA hybrid was joined at a similar maximal rate by T4Dnl and T4Rnl2 at 37 Â°C, we consider the possibility that this could be an unexpected physiological substrate used during some pathways of \u0027DNA repair\u0027.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bullard, DR","Bowater, RP"],"dc:date":"2006-05-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The dominant pattern of variability was one of enhanced deep convection over the whole African monsoon region. It appeared to arise at least partly as a remote response to the intraseasonal (Madden--Julian) oscillation over the warm pool sector. Twenty days prior to the maximum in convection over Africa, there was no signal over Africa but convection was reduced over the equatorial warm pool. An equatorial Kelvin wave response to this change in warm pool convection propagated eastward and an equatorial Rossby wave response propagated westward and between them they completed a circuit of the equator and met up twenty days later over Africa, where the negative mid-tropospheric temperature anomalies in the Kelvin and Rossby wave favoured deep convection. Over West Africa, the Kelvin wave component contained lower-tropospheric westerly anomalies which acted to increase the boundary layer monsoon flow and moisture supply. The westerly anomalies also increased the cyclonic shear on the equatorward flank of the African easterly jet, leading to enhanced African easterly wave and transient convective activity, which then contributed to the enhanced convection over Africa on the longer intraseasonal time scale.

Regression maps of NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data for northern winter show statistically significant upper-tropospheric equatorial wave patterns linked to the tropical convection anomalies, and extratropical wave patterns over the North Pacific, North America, the Atlantic, the Southern Ocean and South America. To assess the cause of the circulation anomalies, a global primitive equation model was initialised with the observed three-dimensional winter climatological-mean flow and forced with a time-dependent heat source derived from the observed MJO anomalies. A model MJO cycle was constructed from the global response to the heating, and both the tropical and extratropical circulation anomalies generally matched the observations well. The equatorial wave patterns are established in a few days, while it takes approximately two weeks for the extratropical patterns to appear. The model response is robust and insensitive to realistic changes in damping and basic state. The model tropical anomalies are consistent with a forced equatorial Rossby--Kelvin wave response to the tropical MJO heating, although it is shifted westward by approximately 20 longitude relative to observations. This may be due to a lack of damping processes (cumulus friction) in the regions of convective heating. Once this shift is accounted for, the extratropical response is consistent with theories of Rossby wave forcing and dispersion on the climatological flow, and the pattern correlation between the observed and modelled extratropical flow is up to 0.85. The observed tropical and extratropical wave patterns accounts for a significant fraction of the intraseasonal circulation variance, and this reproducibility as a response to tropical MJO convection has implications for global medium-range weather prediction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Matthews, AJ","Hoskins, BJ","Masutani, M"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2769392,"sim:weight":0.66356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772852,"sim:weight":0.641573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772851,"sim:weight":0.637042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772847,"sim:weight":0.531786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769386,"sim:weight":0.501972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769382,"sim:weight":0.496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769381,"sim:weight":0.493214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.214837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We present rainfall and seismic records that demonstrate, for the first time, a relationship between intense rainfall and lava dome collapse, with associated pyroclastic flow generation. After seven months of little rain and a period of sustained dome growth, the onset of intense rain was followed within hours by dome collapse and pyroclastic flows. The large-scale weather system responsible for the rain was identifiable in satellite images and predicted by meteorological forecasts issued 60 hours prior to the volcanic activity.

This ESPT reaction involves a proton relay from the phenol hydroxyl of the chromophore to the ionized side chain of E222, and results in formation of the anionic chromophore in a protein environment optimized for the neutral species (the I* state). Reorientation or replacement of E222, as occurs in the S65T and E222Q GFP mutants, disables the ESPT reaction and results in loss of green emission following excitation of the neutral chromophore. Previously, it has been shown that the introduction of a second mutation (H148D) into S65T GFP allows the recovery of green emission, implying that ESPT is again possible. A similar recovery of green fluorescence is also observed for the E222Q/H148D mutant, suggesting that D148 is the proton acceptor for the ESPT reaction in both double mutants. The mechanism of fluorescence emission following excitation of the neutral chromophore in S65T/H148D and E222Q/H148D has been explored through the use of steady state and ultrafast time-resolved fluorescence and vibrational spectroscopy. The data are contrasted with those of the single mutant S65T GFP. Time-resolved fluorescence studies indicate very rapid (\u0026lt;1 ps) formation of I* in the double mutants, followed by vibrational cooling on the picosecond time scale. The time-resolved IR difference spectra are markedly different to those of wtGFP or its anionic mutants. In particular, no spectral signatures are apparent in the picosecond IR difference spectra that would correspond to alteration in the ionization state of D148, leading to the proposal that a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) is present between the phenol hydroxyl of the chromophore and the side chain of D148, with different potential energy surfaces for the ground and excited states. This model is consistent with recent high-resolution structural data in which the distance between the donor and acceptor oxygen atoms is ≤2.4 Å. Importantly, these studies indicate that the hydrogen-bond network in wtGFP can be replaced by a single residue, an observation which, when fully explored, will add to our understanding of the various requirements for proton-transfer reactions within proteins.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stoner-Ma, D.","Jaye, A.A.","Ronayne, K.L.","Nappa, Jerome","Meech, Steve","Tonge, P.J."],"dc:date":"2008-01-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Let Rd \u003d Z[u1±1,...,ud±1] be the ring of Laurent polynomials in d commuting variables, and let M be an Rd-module. Then the dual group XM of M is compact, and multiplication by each of the d variables corresponds to an action aM of Zd by automorphisms of XM. Every action of Zd by automorphisms of a compact abelian group arises this way. If f Î Rd, our main formula shows that the topological entropy of aRd/áfñ \u003e is given by\r\n\r\n\u003cformula\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere M(f) is the Mahler measure of f. This reduces to the classical result for toral automorphisms via Jensen\u0027s formula. While the entropy of a single automorphism of a compact group is always the logarithm of an algebraic integer, this no longer seems to hold for joint entropy of commuting automorphisms since values such as 7z(3)/4p2 occur. If p is a non-principal prime ideal, we show h(aRd/p) \u003d 0. Using an analogue of the Yuzvinskii-Thomas addition formula, we compute h(aM) for arbitrary Rd-modules M, and then the joint entropy for an action of Zd on a (not necessarily abelian) compact group.\r\nUsing a result of Boyd, we characterize those aM which have completely positive entropy in terms of the prime ideals associated to M, and show this condition implies that aM is mixing of all orders. We also establish an analogue of Berg\u0027s theorem, proving that if aM has finite entropy then Haar measure is the unique measure of maximal entropy if and only if aM has completely positive entropy. Finally, we show that for expansive actions the growth rate of the number of periodic points equals the topological entropy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lind, Douglas","Schmidt, Klaus","Ward, Tom"],"dc:date":"1990","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2767302,"sim:weight":0.587682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767309,"sim:weight":0.568702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767308,"sim:weight":0.515614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767315,"sim:weight":0.504824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769437,"sim:weight":0.428069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767310,"sim:weight":0.383416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This\r\nrole, however, becomes subject to revision in the time of recession. Historically each period of economic\r\ndownturn is accompanied by severe critique and substantial limitation of the principles of free market with\r\nundistorted competition. Crisis cartels and similar otherwise restrictive practices often become not only\r\ntolerated but even encouraged by the regulators.This compromise is seen as an inevitable trade-off between\r\ncompetition and other legitimate societal goals, such as industrial growth, social stability, total welfare and\r\nsometimes even national security. On the other hand, each regulatory ‘turbulence’, which is caused by the\r\nrevision of the role of competition within the markets, can be also seen as a fruitful time for introducing\r\nnew elements to the competition policy itself and testing new theories of competition. Dialectical antitrust\r\nis one of these theories.This article explores the role of competition authorities in the period of economic\r\ncrisis applying methodological apparatus of the theory of dialectical antitrust.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andriychuk, Oles"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5086608,"sim:weight":0.755383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":600688,"sim:weight":0.689857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99495,"sim:weight":0.680384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":629524,"sim:weight":0.66579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9616993,"sim:weight":0.659971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775044,"sim:weight":0.645269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5075068,"sim:weight":0.634661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2774684,"sim:weight":0.582662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775043,"sim:weight":0.547406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684193,"sim:weight":0.53142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775069,"sim:weight":0.498129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67204,"sim:weight":0.49386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17354,"sim:weight":0.466801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":949107,"sim:weight":0.463997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7617,"sim:weight":0.4638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67088,"sim:weight":0.462615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821351,"sim:weight":0.458304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7602,"sim:weight":0.451209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5081977,"sim:weight":0.444309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710011,"sim:weight":0.433825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The impact of such variations is explored using idealised perturbation experiments with a coupled climate model, HadCM3. AAIW properties are altered between 10 and 20°S in the South Atlantic, maintaining constant potential density. The perturbed AAIW remains subsurface in the South Atlantic, but as it moves northwards, it surfaces and interacts with the atmosphere leading to density anomalies due to heat exchanges. For a cooler, fresher AAIW, there is a significant decrease in the mean North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST), of up to 1°C, during years 51-100. In the North Atlantic Current region there are persistent cold anomalies from 2,000 m depth to the surface, and in the overlying atmosphere. Atmospheric surface pressure increases over the mid-latitude Atlantic, and precipitation decreases over northwest Africa and southwest Europe. Surface heat flux anomalies show that these impacts are caused by changes in the ocean rather than atmospheric forcing. The SST response is associated with significant changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC). After 50 years there is a decrease in the MOC that persists for the remainder of the simulation, resulting from changes in the column-averaged density difference between 30°S and 60°N. Rather than showing a linear response, a warmer, saltier AAIW also leads to a decreased MOC strength for years 51-100 and resulting cooling in the North Atlantic. The non-linearity can be attributed to opposing density responses as the perturbed water masses interact with the atmosphere.","bibo:AuthorList":["Graham, JA","Stevens, DP","Heywood, KJ","Wang, Z"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":360450,"sim:weight":0.628293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28847,"sim:weight":0.617911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31927,"sim:weight":0.617046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.603835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30697,"sim:weight":0.587521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31932,"sim:weight":0.523876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766154,"sim:weight":0.519872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28620,"sim:weight":0.516247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766152,"sim:weight":0.505695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.503763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30700,"sim:weight":0.50346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269883,"sim:weight":0.496562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29454,"sim:weight":0.480791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28324,"sim:weight":0.469213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31937,"sim:weight":0.467294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27273,"sim:weight":0.45939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29494,"sim:weight":0.458282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.453874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31933,"sim:weight":0.448076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31931,"sim:weight":0.446582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two-component velocity and current density were measured with an ultrasonic Doppler velocity profiler and siphon sampler on the slope, just beyond the slope break and downstream on the horizontal floor. Three main factors influence longitudinal flow evolution and turbulence structure: sediment transport and sedimentation, slope angle, and the presence of a slope break. These controls interact differently depending on flow type. Sediment transport is accompanied by an inertial fluid reaction that enhances Reynolds stresses in turbidity flows. Thus turbidity flows mix more vigorously than equivalent saline density flows. For saline flows, turbulent kinetic energy is dependent on slope, and rapid deceleration occurs on the horizontal floor. For turbidity flows, normalized turbulent kinetic energy increases downstream, and mean streamwise deceleration is reduced compared with saline flows. The slope break causes mean bed-normal velocity of turbidity flows to become negative and have a gentler gradient compared with other locations. A reduction of peak Reynolds normal stress in the bed-normal direction is accompanied by an increase in turbulent accelerations across the rest of the flow thickness. Thus the presence of particles acts to increase Reynolds normal stresses independently of gradients of mean velocity, and sediment transport increases across the break in slope. The experiments illustrate that saline density currents may not be good dynamic analogues for natural turbidity currents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gray, TE","Alexander, J","Leeder, MR"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":177400,"sim:weight":0.157332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177320,"sim:weight":0.134303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

General results about these systems give a rather complete description of the well-known dynamics in one-dimensional additive cellular automata with prime alphabet, including simple formulae for the topological entropy and the number of periodic configurations. For these systems the periodic points are uniformly distributed along some subsequence with respect to the maximal measure, and in particular are dense. Periodic points may be constructed arbitrarily close to a given configuration, and rationality of the dynamical zeta function is characterized. Throughout the emphasis is to place this particular family of cellular automata into the wider context of S-integer dynamical systems, and to show how the arithmetic of rational function fields determines their behaviour. Using a covering space the dynamics of additive cellular automata are related to a form of hyperbolicity in completions of rational function fields. This expresses the topological entropy of the automata directly in terms of volume growth in the covering space.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ward, Thomas B."],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":2768407,"ep:Repository":124,"dc:type":["Article","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Arterial bends: the development and decay of helical flows.","bibo:abstract":"The macrocirculation is modelled by incompressible Newtonian flow through a rigid network of pipes for which possible simplifications are discussed. The common assumptions of two-dimensionality or axisymmetry can be generalised to helical symmetry, and in the first part of the paper, the three-dimensionality of arterial bends is considered by varying the curvature and torsion of a section of a helical pipe. The torsion is found to impart a preferential twist to the cross-sectional flow. This loss of symmetry ensures that flow separation is less severe for a helical bend than for a toroidal bend. The effects of variations in body size are examined using allometric scaling laws. In the second part of the paper, the approach to \"fully developed\" Dean or Womersley flow is considered in an attempt to quantify the regions of validity of idealised models. A perturbation approach, akin to hydrodynamic stability theory, is used. It is argued that often potential flows are more suitable for describing the rapid interactions between geometry and pulsatility rather than the eventual fully developed state so that, for example, the first 100 degrees of the aortic arch may be considered irrotational. Helical potential flows are found to develop faster than the corresponding toroidal flows, but slower than those in a straight pipe. The presence of vorticity in the core also retards the development of symmetric flows. It is concluded that while idealised flows can occur at some points in the body, in general experimental observation is needed to justify their use. Particular caution is recommended when interpreting calculations with Poiseuille input.","bibo:AuthorList":["Blyth, M.G.","Mestel, A.J.","Zabielski, L."],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.295602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9019941,"sim:weight":0.291227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48331,"sim:weight":0.289226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145764,"sim:weight":0.282625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58133,"sim:weight":0.28044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98614,"sim:weight":0.280438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9019114,"sim:weight":0.25484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.251753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99427,"sim:weight":0.246909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53534,"sim:weight":0.245431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102578,"sim:weight":0.243905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1568204,"sim:weight":0.239386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99491,"sim:weight":0.236577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.236457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30664,"sim:weight":0.233777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.232668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.232277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4872629,"sim:weight":0.229718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99097,"sim:weight":0.222881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98760,"sim:weight":0.213092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The magmatic gas mass flux, porosity and permeability of the rock are identified as key parameters. New, theoretical, nonlinear steady-state thermal profiles are reported which give a realistic surface temperature of 210 degC for a region of lava dome surface through which a gas flux of 3.5 x 10-3 kg s-1 m-2 passes. This contrasts favourably with earlier purely diffusive thermal models, which cool too quickly. Results are presented for time-dependent perturbations of the steady states as a response to: changes in surface pressure, a sudden rockfall from the lava dome surface, and a change in the magmatic gas mass flux at depth. Together with a generalized analysis using the method of multiple scales, this identifies two characteristic time scales associated with the thermal evolution of a dome carapace: a short time scale of several minutes, over which the magmatic gas mass flux, density, and pressure change to a new quasi-steady-state, and a longer time scale of several days, over which the thermal profile changes to a new equilibrium distribution. Over the longer time scale the dynamic properties of the dome continue to evolve, but only in slavish response to the ongoing temperature evolution. In the light of this time scale separation, the use of surface temperature measurements to infer changes in the magmatic gas flux for use in volcanic hazard prediction is discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hicks, PD","Matthews, AJ","Cooker, MJ"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2772846,"sim:weight":0.828121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767048,"sim:weight":0.609023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27356,"sim:weight":0.341061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3065,"sim:weight":0.330323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.308025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890336,"sim:weight":0.29892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97223,"sim:weight":0.277251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108347,"sim:weight":0.273137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145299,"sim:weight":0.245597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890284,"sim:weight":0.228378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26017,"sim:weight":0.224613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43270,"sim:weight":0.223312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.213454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108630,"sim:weight":0.203206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.199661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4872629,"sim:weight":0.189373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108048,"sim:weight":0.168797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108986,"sim:weight":0.16507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Karp\u0027s notion of a chain model of size κ is defined to be an ordinary model of size κ along with a decomposition of it into an increasing union of length cf(κ). With a notion of satisfaction and (chain)-isomorphism such models give an infinitary logic largely mimicking first order logic. In this paper we associate to this logic a notion of a dynamic EF-game which gauges when two chain models are chain-isomorphic. To this game is associated a tree which is a tree of size κ with no κ-branches (even no cf(κ)-branches). The measure of how non-isomorphic the models are is reflected by a certain order on these trees, called reduction. We study the collection of trees of size κ with no κ-branches under this notion and prove that when cf(κ) \u003d ω this collection is rather regular; in particular it has universality number exactly κ+. Such trees are then used to develop a descriptive set theory of the space cf(κ)κ.\r\n\r\nThe main result of the paper gives in the case of κ strong limit singular an exact connection between the descriptive set-theoretic complexity of the chain isomorphism orbit of a model, the reduction order on the trees and winning strategies in the corresponding dynamic EF games. In particular we obtain a neat analog of the notion of Scott watershed from the Scott analysis of countable models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Džamonja, M","Väänänen, J"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2768488,"sim:weight":0.568856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890296,"sim:weight":0.523762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890341,"sim:weight":0.477522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":240751,"sim:weight":0.467593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98983,"sim:weight":0.459276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2111921,"sim:weight":0.450588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934327,"sim:weight":0.446278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85430,"sim:weight":0.442878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86312,"sim:weight":0.424442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154383,"sim:weight":0.417441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9033271,"sim:weight":0.40252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890320,"sim:weight":0.397587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":72959,"sim:weight":0.383839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4881695,"sim:weight":0.383344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101552,"sim:weight":0.37903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.371321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4896009,"sim:weight":0.36646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.359133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708050,"sim:weight":0.356693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187692,"sim:weight":0.348025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I define the theory of a set of differential equations and give an axiomatization for the theory of the exponential differential equations of split semiabelian varieties. In particular, this includes the theory of the equations satisfied by the usual complex exponential function and the Weierstrass p-functions.\r\n\r\nThe theory consists of a description of the algebraic structure on the solution sets together with necessary and sufficient conditions for a system of equations to have solutions. These conditions are stated in terms of a dimension theory; their necessity generalizes Ax’s differential field version of Schanuel’s conjecture and their sufficiency generalizes recent work of Crampin. They are shown to apply to the solving of systems of equations in holomorphic functions away from singularities, as well as in the abstract setting.\r\n\r\nThe theory can also be obtained by means of a Hrushovski-style amalgamation construction, and I give a category-theoretic account of the method.\r\n\r\nRestricting to the usual exponential differential equation, I show that a “blurring” of Zilber’s pseudo-exponentiation satisfies the same theory. I conjecture that this theory also holds for a suitable blurring of the complex exponential maps and partially resolve the question, proving the necessity but not the sufficiency of the aforementioned conditions.\r\n\r\nAs an algebraic application, I prove a weak form of Zilber’s conjecture on intersections with subgroups (known as CIT) for semiabelian varieties. This in turn is used to show that the necessary and sufficient conditions are expressible in the appropriate first order language.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kirby, J"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1568223,"sim:weight":0.419815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382821,"sim:weight":0.307151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764022,"sim:weight":0.269738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96507,"sim:weight":0.246786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768531,"sim:weight":0.244743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43155,"sim:weight":0.23431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1151801,"sim:weight":0.234182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4886125,"sim:weight":0.232519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86312,"sim:weight":0.230864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85430,"sim:weight":0.227706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708050,"sim:weight":0.225954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9033271,"sim:weight":0.22553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708076,"sim:weight":0.219977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4892776,"sim:weight":0.218912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384318,"sim:weight":0.218819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2166669,"sim:weight":0.217508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85298,"sim:weight":0.21516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351913,"sim:weight":0.211106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4887416,"sim:weight":0.209611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890320,"sim:weight":0.209281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Over time, the deep ocean is presumably at steady state, with sources and sinks balanced. But recently compiled global budgets and intensive local field studies suggest that estimates of metabolic activity in the dark ocean exceed the influx of organic substrates. This imbalance indicates either the existence of unaccounted sources of organic carbon or that metabolic activity in the dark ocean is being over-estimated. Budgets of organic carbon flux and metabolic activity in the dark ocean have uncertainties associated with environmental variability, measurement capabilities, conversion parameters, and processes that are not well sampled. We present these issues and quantify associated uncertainties where possible, using a Monte Carlo analysis of a published data set to determine the probability that the imbalance can be explained purely by uncertainties in measurements and conversion factors. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the bacterial growth efficiencies and assumed cell carbon contents have the greatest effects on the magnitude of the carbon imbalance. Two poorly quantified sources, lateral advection of particles and a population of slowly settling particles, are discussed as providing a means of closing regional carbon budgets. Finally, we make recommendations concerning future research directions to reduce important uncertainties and allow a better determination of the magnitude and causes of the unbalanced carbon budgets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burd, AB","Hansell, DA","Steinberg, DK","Anderson, TR","Aristegui, J","Baltar, F","Beaupre, SR","Buesseler, KO","Dehairs, F","Jackson, GA","Kadko, DC","Koppelmann, R","Lampitt, RS","Nagata, T","Reinthaler, T","Robinson, C","Robison, BH","Tamburini, C","Tanaka, T"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":731597,"sim:weight":0.629457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":771016,"sim:weight":0.588716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772698,"sim:weight":0.56482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1097034,"sim:weight":0.546804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9630172,"sim:weight":0.490834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761077,"sim:weight":0.455904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":661459,"sim:weight":0.451264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771330,"sim:weight":0.423649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1083386,"sim:weight":0.417429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182425,"sim:weight":0.412718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767706,"sim:weight":0.400717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":771006,"sim:weight":0.385002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69725,"sim:weight":0.344261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771289,"sim:weight":0.306053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68665,"sim:weight":0.27757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96501,"sim:weight":0.227089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69159,"sim:weight":0.180759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772247,"sim:weight":0.177414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67751,"sim:weight":0.173313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.155559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Unique low-level observations of an Antarctic coastal polynya, the Ronne Polynya, were conducted using an instrumented aircraft. At the time of the observations, the polynya was mostly covered with thin ice perforated with holes and was composed of two distinct regimes: an inner region of newly formed and thin ice and an outer region of thicker more consolidated ice. The sensible heat flux over the polynya was ∼100 W m−2 and decreased with fetch, primarily as a result of the thickening ice cover. The mean sensible heat transfer and drag coefficients over the polynya were CHN10 \u003d (0.7 ± 0.1) × 10−3 and CDN10 \u003d (1.1 ± 0.2) × 10−3, respectively. The heat transfer coefficient is similar to that found over heterogeneous sea ice and is significantly lower than has been used in previous studies of heat fluxes over polynyas, which are often assumed to be open water. The transfer coefficients were not found to be a function of fetch or ice conditions as represented by the surface temperature and albedo.

This hypothesis is investigated with a set of three atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments. 1) When soil moisture is fully coupled with the atmospheric model, the 15-day mode of land--atmosphere variability is clearly identified. Precipitation anomalies lead soil moisture anomalies by 1--2 days, similar to the results from satellite observations. 2) In a sensitivity experiment, soil moisture is externally prescribed with all intraseasonal fluctuations suppressed. The 15-day precipitation signal is still present, as a purely internal atmospheric free mode, though its propagation is less coherent. 3) In a final experiment, the atmospheric model is forced with a 15-day westward-propagating cycle of regional soil moisture anomalies based on the observed mode. Through a reduced surface sensible heat flux, the imposed wet soil anomalies induce negative low-level temperature anomalies and increased pressure (a cool high). An anticyclonic circulation then develops around the region of wet soil which enhances northward moisture advection and convection to the west. This favours westward propagation, such that the atmospheric 15-day free mode becomes weakly phase locked to the imposed soil moisture forcing. Hence, although the 15-day wave can exist as a purely internal atmospheric mode, soil moisture and land--atmosphere coupling act to further organise the mode and increase its coherence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lavender, SL","Taylor, CM","Matthews, AJ"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2771088,"sim:weight":0.492135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.273006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43343,"sim:weight":0.217987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931226,"sim:weight":0.170208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the food web interactions that occur in the mesopelagic zone are difficult to measure and so, despite their crucial importance to global elemental cycles, are not very well known. Recent developments in technology and new approaches have advanced the study of the variability in and controls upon the distribution and diversity of organisms in the mesopelagic zone, including the roles of respiration, recycling, and repackaging of particulate and dissolved organic material. However, there are remarkably few syntheses of the ecology and biogeochemistry of the microbes and metazoa that permanently reside or habitually visit this \u0027twilight zone\u0027. Without this synthesis, it is difficult to assess the impact of ongoing changes in ocean hydrography and chemistry, due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, on the biological carbon pump. This paper reviews what is known about the distribution of microbes and metazoa in the mesopelagic zone in relation to their activity and impact on global biogeochemical cycles. Thus, gaps in our knowledge are identified and suggestions made for priority research programmes that will improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on carbon sequestration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Robinson, C","Steinberg, DK","Anderson, TR","Aristegui, J","Carlson, CA","Frost, JR","Ghiglione, JF","Hernandez-Leon, S","Jackson, GA","Koppelmann, R","Queguier, B","Ragueneau, O","Rassoulzadegan, F","Robison, BH","Tamburini, C","Tanaka, T","Wishner, KF","Zhang, J"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23922,"sim:weight":0.676767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":731597,"sim:weight":0.550011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9630172,"sim:weight":0.491084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24791,"sim:weight":0.44836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.428189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772698,"sim:weight":0.427465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":744449,"sim:weight":0.418127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":771016,"sim:weight":0.409534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31149,"sim:weight":0.40859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26714,"sim:weight":0.404282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1079894,"sim:weight":0.40357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23178,"sim:weight":0.397024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1097031,"sim:weight":0.3858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":661269,"sim:weight":0.385196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771330,"sim:weight":0.381995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":661459,"sim:weight":0.379187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761077,"sim:weight":0.378428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1018530,"sim:weight":0.37687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":760635,"sim:weight":0.374055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23541,"sim:weight":0.373644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The reasons behind these model inaccuracies are explored. The ocean mixed layer heat budget is examined in four of the CMIP3 models and by using observations- reanalyses. The SST response to the SAM is predominantly driven by sensible and latent heat flux and Ekman heat transport anomalies. The radiative heat fluxes play a lesser but nonnegligible role. Errors in the simulated SST responses are traced back to deficiencies in the atmospheric response to the SAM. The models exaggerate the surface wind response to the SAM leading to large unrealistic Ekman transport anomalies. During the positive phase of the SAM, this results in excessive simulated cooling in the 40°-65°S latitudes. Problems with the simulated wind stress responses, which relate partly to errors in the simulated winds themselves and partly to the transfer coefficients used in the models, are a key cause of the errors in the SST response. In the central Pacific sector (90°-150°W), errors arise because the simulated SAM is too zonally symmetric. Substantial errors in the net shortwave radiation are also found, resulting from a poor repre- sentation of the changes in cloud cover associated with the SAM. The problems in the simulated SST re- sponses shown by this study are comparable to deficiencies previously identified in the CMIP3 multimodel mean. Therefore, it is likely that the deficiencies identified here are common to other climate models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Screen, JA","Gillett, NaP","Karpechko, AY","Stevens, DP"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2771201,"sim:weight":0.533714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766154,"sim:weight":0.369661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43343,"sim:weight":0.363921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, viewing it as a strategic niche with aim to influence wider society, it is clear that it faces significant challenges in diffusing its ideas and practices beyond the niche. Its model is not necessarily suitable for scaling up or widespread replication; however, the scope for niche lessons to be adopted by mainstream builders is greater, given a supportive policy environment.

These jets are thought to play an important role in both preconditioning for, and triggering of, open-ocean convection in the Irminger Sea. However, the relatively small spatial scale of the jets prevents their accurate representation in the relatively low resolution (∼1 degree) atmospheric (re-)analyses which are typically used to force ocean general circulation models (e.g. ECMWF ERA-40 and NCEP reanalyses, or products based on these). Here we present a method of ‘bogussing’ Greenland\u0027s tip jets into such surface wind fields and thus, via bulk flux formulae, into the air-sea turbulent flux fields. In this way the full impact of these mesoscale tip jets can be incorporated in any ocean general circulation model of sufficient resolution. The tip jet parameterization is relatively simple, making use of observed linear gradients in wind speed along and across the jet, but is shown to be accurate to a few m s−1 on average. The inclusion of tip jets results in a large local increase in both the heat and momentum fluxes. When applied to a 1-dimensional mixed-layer model this results in a deepening of the winter mixed-layer of over 300 m. The parameterization scheme only requires 10 meter wind speed and mean sea level pressure as input fields; thus it is also suitable for incorporation into a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model at the coupling stage.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sproson, DAJ","Renfrew, I","Heywood, KJ"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2771524,"sim:weight":0.619551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771431,"sim:weight":0.614727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper builds on the concept of ‘carbon capability’, a term which captures the contextual meanings associated with carbon and individuals’ abilities and motivations to reduce emissions. We present empirical findings from a UK survey of public engagement with climate change and carbon capability, focusing on both individual and institutional dimensions. These findings highlight the diverse public understandings about ‘carbon’, encompassing technical, social, and moral discourses; and provide further evidence for the environmental value-action gap in relation to adoption of low-carbon lifestyles.

In some species of Shewanella, deca-heme electron transfer proteins lie at the extracellular face of the outer membrane (OM), where they can interact with insoluble substrates. To reduce extracellular substrates, these redox proteins must be charged by the inner membrane/periplasmic electron transfer system. Here, we present a spectro-potentiometric characterization of a trans-OM icosa-heme complex, MtrCAB, and demonstrate its capacity to move electrons across a lipid bilayer after incorporation into proteoliposomes. We also show that a stable MtrAB subcomplex can assemble in the absence of MtrC; an MtrBC subcomplex is not assembled in the absence of MtrA; and MtrA is only associated to the membrane in cells when MtrB is present. We propose a model for the modular organization of the MtrCAB complex in which MtrC is an extracellular element that mediates electron transfer to extracellular substrates and MtrB is a trans-OM spanning β-barrel protein that serves as a sheath, within which MtrA and MtrC exchange electrons. We have identified the MtrAB module in a range of bacterial phyla, suggesting that it is widely used in electron exchange with the extracellular environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hartshorne, RS","Reardon, CL","Ross, D","Nuester, J","Clarke, TA","Gates, AJ","Mills, PC","Fredrickson, JK","Zachara, JM","Shi, L","Beliaev, AS","Marshall, MJ","Tien, M","Brantley, S","Butt, JN","Richardson, DJ"],"dc:date":"2009-12-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2777073,"sim:weight":0.703607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780582,"sim:weight":0.690887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.506514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.432582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205917,"sim:weight":0.410282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.367662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769012,"sim:weight":0.330556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.32678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.319317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.308854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768022,"sim:weight":0.306245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.305218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.303625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.301757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.300447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930158,"sim:weight":0.287163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.27943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.273962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47544,"sim:weight":0.269202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45616,"sim:weight":0.260055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In each of the tropical ocean basins, significant equatorial waves are forced, which are shown to modulate the sea surface temperature (SST) by 0.2-0.3 degC in the absence of strong surface heat fluxes. In the Indian Ocean there is a clear dynamical response which may play a significant role in generating later MJ events. Surface westerly winds, associated with the active phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), force an eastward-propagating oceanic downwelling equatorial Kelvin wave, which, on reaching the eastern boundary at Sumatra, forces reflected downwelling equatorial Rossby waves and coastal Kelvin waves. The coastal Kelvin waves propagate southwards towards northern Australia and northwards into the Bay of Bengal, and will be important for local physical, chemical and biological processes. The equatorial Rossby waves propagate westward across the Indian Ocean, arriving in the western Indian Ocean approximately 80-100 days after the initial Kelvin wave was generated. The arrival of these waves generates positive SST anomalies which leads to convection and may trigger the next-but-one MJ event, or amplify the low-frequency tail of the MJO. This constitutes a coupled feedback mechanism from the ocean dynamics onto the MJO, somewhat similar to the delayed oscillator mechanism for the El Nino Southern Oscillation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Webber, BGM","Matthews, AJ","Heywood, KJ"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2772852,"sim:weight":0.759296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768886,"sim:weight":0.706569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2782731,"sim:weight":0.630726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772851,"sim:weight":0.626702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767047,"sim:weight":0.600983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29494,"sim:weight":0.563636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31869,"sim:weight":0.504069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.486956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30700,"sim:weight":0.469423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27259,"sim:weight":0.454075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30697,"sim:weight":0.437673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2674698,"sim:weight":0.424763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.421721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31926,"sim:weight":0.410986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29479,"sim:weight":0.408767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.406974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31928,"sim:weight":0.406321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.403785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31927,"sim:weight":0.398903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269883,"sim:weight":0.371152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While such models are skilful up to 25 days lead time, by design they only predict the very largest-scale features of the MJO. Here we present a higher-order MJO statistical forecast model that is able to predict MJO variability on smaller, more localised scales, that will be of more direct benefit to national weather agencies and regional government planning. The model is based on daily outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) data that are intraseasonally filtered using a recently developed technique of empirical mode decomposition that can be used in real time. A standard truncated PC analysis is then used to isolate the maximum amount of variance in a finite number of modes. The evolution of these modes is then forecast using a neural network model, which does not suffer from the parametrisation problems of other statistical forecast techniques when applied to a higher number of modes. Compared to a standard 2-PC model, the higher-order PC model showed improved skill over the whole MJO domain, with substantial improvements over the western Pacific, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, South China Sea and Phillipine Sea.","bibo:AuthorList":["Love, BS","Matthews, AJ"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2771411,"sim:weight":0.693885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27259,"sim:weight":0.423358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772847,"sim:weight":0.396423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.384336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146163,"sim:weight":0.366163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4896009,"sim:weight":0.345487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.334115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186392,"sim:weight":0.330572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.319983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30697,"sim:weight":0.316072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.314621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.312761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.302572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.302572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.302572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.302572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.302572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.302572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.302572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.302572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We take advantage of the sporadic nature of the MJO and classify each observed Madden-Julian (MJ) event as either primary, with no immediately preceding MJ event, or successive, which does immediately follow a preceding event. 40% of MJ events are primary events. Precursor features of the primary events can be unambiguously attributed to that event. A suppressed convective anomaly grows and decays in situ over the Indian Ocean, prior to the start of most primary MJ events. An associated mid-tropospheric temperature anomaly destabilises the atmosphere, leading to the generation of the active MJ event. Hence, primary MJ events appear to be thermodynamically triggered by a previous dry period, although stochastic forcing may also be important. Other theories predict that boundary-layer convergence, humidity, propagation of dynamical structures around the Equator, sea surface temperatures, and lateral forcing by extratropical transients may all be important in triggering an event. Although precursor signals from these mechanisms are diagnosed from reanalysis and satellite observational data in the successive MJ events, they are all absent in the primary MJ events. Hence, it appears that these apparent precursor signals are part of the MJO once it is established, but do not play a role in the spontaneous generation of the MJO. The most frequent starting location of the primary events is the Indian Ocean, but over half of them start elsewhere, from the maritime continent to the western Pacific.","bibo:AuthorList":["Matthews, Adrian J."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2769380,"sim:weight":0.614527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772852,"sim:weight":0.607309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2782731,"sim:weight":0.60067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771088,"sim:weight":0.58645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769383,"sim:weight":0.576548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768886,"sim:weight":0.556115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771792,"sim:weight":0.548302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772851,"sim:weight":0.531823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767047,"sim:weight":0.521372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766119,"sim:weight":0.507167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772847,"sim:weight":0.488019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771411,"sim:weight":0.486762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29494,"sim:weight":0.39976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.388403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2674698,"sim:weight":0.364384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31869,"sim:weight":0.357714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31926,"sim:weight":0.331868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.331424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31928,"sim:weight":0.324387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.320017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":2769380,"ep:Repository":124,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Propagation mechanisms for the Madden-Julian Oscillation","bibo:abstract":"The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is examined using 20 years of outgoing longwave radiation and NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data. Two mechanisms for the eastward propagation and regeneration of the convective anomalies are suggested.\r\n\r\nThe first is a local mechanism operating over the warm pool region. At the phase of the MJO with a dipole structure to the convection anomalies, there is enhanced tropical convection over the eastern Indian Ocean and reduced convection over the western Pacific. Over the equatorial western Indian Ocean, the equatorial Rossby wave response to the west of the enhanced convection includes a region of anomalous surface divergence associated with the anomalous surface westerlies and pressure ridge. This tends to suppress ascent in the boundary layer and shuts off the deep convection, eventually leading to a convective anomaly of the opposite sign. Over the Indonesian sector, the equatorial Kelvin wave response to the east of the enhanced convection includes a region of anomalous surface convergence into the anomalous equatorial surface easterlies and pressure trough, which will tend to favour convection in this region. The Indonesian sector is also influenced by an equatorial Rossby wave response (of opposite sign) to the west of the reduced convection over the western Pacific, which also has a region of anomalous surface convergence associated with its anomalous equatorial surface easterlies and pressure trough. Hence, convective anomalies of either sign tend to erode themselves from the west and initiate a convective anomaly of opposite sign via their equatorial Rossby wave response, and expand to the east via their equatorial Kelvin wave response.\r\n\r\nThe second is a global mechanism involving an anomaly completing a circuit of the equator. Enhanced convection over the tropical western Pacific excites a negative sea level pressure (SLP) anomaly which radiates rapidly eastward as a dry equatorial Kelvin wave at approximately 35 m s-1 over the eastern Pacific. It is blocked by the orographic barrier of the Andes and Central America for several days before propagating through the gap at Panama. After rapidly propagating as a dry equatorial Kelvin wave over the Atlantic, the SLP anomaly is delayed further by the East African Highlands before it reaches the Indian Ocean and coincides with the development of enhanced convection at the start of the next MJO cycle.","bibo:AuthorList":["Matthews, AJ"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2772852,"sim:weight":0.657624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769372,"sim:weight":0.614527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772851,"sim:weight":0.59296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772855,"sim:weight":0.543897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772847,"sim:weight":0.490794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The convection occurs in the regions of ascent and reduced static stability ahead of cyclonic anomalies in the wave train. In this study an atmospheric primitive-equation model is used to examine the roles of the dry wave dynamics and the diabatic heating associated with the convection.\r\n\r\nMany features of a dry integration initialized with a localized wave train in the African--Asian jet on a three-dimensional climatological basic state quantitatively agree with the observations, including the zonal-wavenumber 6--7 scale of the waves, the time period of approximately 12 days and the cross-equatorial Rossby wave propagation over the eastern Pacific. There is ascent and reduced static stability ahead of the cyclonic anomalies, consistent with the interpretation of the waves forcing the convection. The spatial scale of the waves appears to be set by the basic state; baroclinic growth upstream in the Asian jet favors waves with zonal-wavenumber 6. On reaching the Pacific sector, lower-wavenumber components of the wave train are not refracted so strongly equatorward, while higher-wavenumber components are advected quickly along the Pacific jet before they can propagate equatorward. Once over the Pacific, the wave train approximately obeys barotropic Rossby wave dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe observed lower-tropospheric anomalies include an equatorial Rossby wave that propagates westward from the region of cross-equatorial wave propagation and tropical convection. However, this equatorial Rossby wave is not triggered directly by the equatorward-propagating wave train, but appears in a separate integration as a forced response to the observed diabatic heating associated with the tropical convection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Matthews, AJ","Kiladis, GN"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2769382,"sim:weight":0.697419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769392,"sim:weight":0.610503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767047,"sim:weight":0.586402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766158,"sim:weight":0.516349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769384,"sim:weight":0.513473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767049,"sim:weight":0.493214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107323,"sim:weight":0.486397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002000,"sim:weight":0.484321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107320,"sim:weight":0.445822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199815,"sim:weight":0.401774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29479,"sim:weight":0.389445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.38223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31926,"sim:weight":0.363045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30700,"sim:weight":0.35512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766152,"sim:weight":0.351762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31928,"sim:weight":0.344834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.344706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30697,"sim:weight":0.337896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31931,"sim:weight":0.332867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29454,"sim:weight":0.327718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The model was forced with constant equinoctial (March) boundary conditions so that a ``clean\u0027\u0027 MJO signal could be separated from the effects of the seasonal cycle and forced interannual variability. The simulated MJO was fairly realistic in terms of its large-scale spatial structure and propagation characteristics, although its period of 30 days (corresponding to an average phase speed of 15 \\mps) was shorter than that observed. The signal in deep convection was less coherent than in observations, and appeared to move eastward as a sequence of discrete convective anomalies, rather than by a smooth eastward propagation. Both ``fast\u0027\u0027 and ``slow\u0027\u0027 equatorial Kelvin waves appeared to play an important role in the eastward propagation of the simulated MJO. Enhanced convection over the Indian Ocean was associated with a ``fast\u0027\u0027 equatorial Kelvin wave that propagated eastward at 55 m s-1 over the Pacific. On reaching the west coast of South America, a component of this Kelvin wave propagated northward and southward as a trapped wave along the mountain ranges of Central America and the Andes, in agreement with observations. The anomalous surface easterlies over the tropical eastern Pacific associated with this fast Kelvin wave enhanced the climatological mean easterlies and led to positive convective anomalies over the eastern Pacific consistent with the WISHE mechanism. However, WISHE was not able to account for the eastward development of the convective anomalies over the Indian Ocean/western Pacific region.

Large scale convection, associated with an MJO, is assumed to be already established over the Indonesian region. The latent heating associated with this convection forces an equatorial Rossby wave response with an upper tropospheric anticyclone, centred over or slightly to the west of the convection. Large potential vorticity (PV) gradients, associated with the subtropical jet and the tropopause, lie just poleward of the anticyclone and large magnitude PV air is advected equatorwards on the eastern side of the anticyclone. This ``high\u0027\u0027 PV air, or upper tropospheric trough, is far enough off the equator that it has associated strong horizontal temperature gradients, and it induces deep ascent on its eastern side, at a latitude of about 15-30\\degr. If this deep ascent is over a region susceptible to deep convection, such as the SPCZ region, then convection may be forced or triggered. Hence convection develops along the SPCZ as a forced response to convection over Indonesia. The response mechanism is essentially one of subtropical Rossby wave propagation. This hypothesis is based on a case study of a particularly strong MJO in early 1988, and is tested by idealised modelling studies.

During the phase of the MJO with enhanced convection over the East Indian Ocean and Indonesia, and suppressed convection over the South Pacific convergence zone, both the Asian--Pacific jet and the region of upper-tropospheric tropical easterlies over the warm pool are displaced westward. These changes in the basic state lead to a weaker or ``leakier\u0027\u0027 waveguide in the Asian--Pacific jet, with a westward-displaced ``forbidden\u0027\u0027 region of tropical easterlies, such that high-frequency transient waves propagate equatorwards into the deep tropics over the central Pacific near the date line. As these waves induce convection in the region of ascent and reduced static stability ahead of the upper-level cyclonic disturbances, there is an enhancement of high-frequency convective variability over the central Pacific intertropical convergence zone during this phase of the MJO. This enhanced high-frequency convective variability appears to project back onto intraseasonal timescales, and forms an integral part of the slowly varying diabatic heating field of the MJO. In the opposite phase of the MJO, the Asian--Pacific jet is extended eastward and there is an almost continuous waveguide across the Pacific. Together with the expanded forbidden region of tropical easterlies over the warm pool, this leads to a more zonal propagation of high-frequency transients along the waveguide with less equatorward propagation, and hence reduced high-frequency convective variability over the tropical central Pacific. There is also evidence of high-frequency waves propagating into the Indian Ocean region at the beginning of the MJO cycle, which may be important in the initiation of intraseasonal convective anomalies there.","bibo:AuthorList":["Matthews, AJ","Kiladis, GN"],"dc:date":"1999","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2769382,"sim:weight":0.725885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2782731,"sim:weight":0.725375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769383,"sim:weight":0.684782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771088,"sim:weight":0.668784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767049,"sim:weight":0.66356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767047,"sim:weight":0.641486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771792,"sim:weight":0.633907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769381,"sim:weight":0.610503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772854,"sim:weight":0.608872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4888710,"sim:weight":0.592688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772851,"sim:weight":0.587349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772852,"sim:weight":0.571025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766119,"sim:weight":0.552256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772847,"sim:weight":0.51356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769386,"sim:weight":0.50459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.415776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772855,"sim:weight":0.404015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31926,"sim:weight":0.396217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2674698,"sim:weight":0.392801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29494,"sim:weight":0.383265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The atomic oxygen line at 557.7 nm, the sodium D lines at 589.0 and 589.6 nm, and the OH(6,2) band at 826–862 nm were monitored using an airborne spectrometer over the North Atlantic (40–50°N).

The spectrometer resolved the sodium doublet, and showed that the ratio of the D2 and D1 lines is not 2.0, as had been thought hitherto, but is highly variable on distances of a few tens of kilometers.

The recovery of ground-state OIO after a few microseconds indicates that, after excitation from the ground 2B1 to the (first) excited 2B2 state, OIO undergoes rapid internal conversion onto high vibrational levels of the 2B1 state, followed by quenching collisions with the bath gas. A detailed kinetic model is used to show that the OIO yield from the IO self reaction is 0.31 ± 0.10 at 40 Torr and 293 K. The rapid removal of OIO in the reactor is explained by the recombination of atomic I and OIO with a rate constant of (1.1 ± 0.3) × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. Ab initio calculations combined with RRKM theory are used to show that this rate constant is consistent with the addition of the I atom to the central I, rather than either of the terminal O atoms.

The molecular dynamics is probed either by pulses at the same spectral position or by 20 fs pulses overlapping with both the S0–S1 absorption and emission bands. Three contributions on distinctly different time scales are observed in the temporally and spectrally resolved two‐color measurements. In the regime below 50 fs, a strong coherent coupling of the S0–Sn and the S0–S1 transitions occurs that is due to coherent vibrational motions in the electronic ground state. This signal is superimposed on the fast bleaching of the electronic ground state, resulting in a steplike increase of transmission. In the range of the S0–S1 emission band, one finds a subsequent picosecond rise of transmission that is due to stimulated emission from vibronic S1 states. The data demonstrate that the relaxation of Sn states directly populated by the pump pulses is much faster than the buildup of stimulated emission. This gives insight into different steps of intramolecular vibronic redistribution and is compared to the Sn–S1 relaxation in other molecules.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ashworth, Stephen","Hasche, T.","Woerner, M.","Riedle, E.","Elsaesser, T."],"dc:date":"1996","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45702,"sim:weight":0.296635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45585,"sim:weight":0.294376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154235,"sim:weight":0.275991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870455,"sim:weight":0.269423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100685,"sim:weight":0.266871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51377,"sim:weight":0.261326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108107,"sim:weight":0.259469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4869179,"sim:weight":0.248277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397159,"sim:weight":0.247747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870430,"sim:weight":0.230592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32784,"sim:weight":0.220922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4872166,"sim:weight":0.219195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154431,"sim:weight":0.215248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4887064,"sim:weight":0.204493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271232,"sim:weight":0.202164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85991,"sim:weight":0.201645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4869173,"sim:weight":0.19621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268391,"sim:weight":0.195191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26650,"sim:weight":0.193707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98870,"sim:weight":0.190673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Ab initio quantum calculations were performed on the ground and first excited states of OIO. The rotational envelopes of the observed absorption bands are very satisfactorily simulated if the lifetime of the excited state is 200 ± 50 fs, indicating prompt predissociation. Quantum calculations indicate photolysis to I + O2, rather than O + IO. The estimated photodissociation rate of OIO in daylight ranges from 0.36 to 2.2 s-1, depending on the choice of absolute cross-section, which explains why OIO has only been observed in the atmosphere after sunset.

By analogy with the zeins it is believed that the α-kafirins probably have an extended hairpin structure in solution, comprising elements of α-helix, β-sheet and turns folded back on itself. Kafirins are the most hydrophobic of the prolamins as shown by their solubility, and calculated hydration free energies. The proteins exhibit extensive cross-linking by disulphide bonds and on cooking form indigestible aggregates which are not solubilised by reduction of disulphide bonds. In spite of continuing studies, the reasons for the low digestibility of the protein remain uncertain and there may be several factors involved.

The results suggest that at low glycerol levels the glycerol is absorbed onto and possibly into the protein. Increasing the level of glycerol increases the motion of the protein and changes the protein conformation. There are corresponding changes of the mechanical properties of protein films. At 40% (w/w) of glycerol, two glass transition temperatures were observed, one of which corresponded to the glass transition temperature of pure glycerol.

In gluten, the ratio of β-sheet to random and β-turn structures changed on extension. After the applied force was released, the sample recovered some of its original shape and structure, but the material became stiffer in consecutive extension cycles.

The addition of sodium hydroxide to an aqueous ethanol extractant increased the yield and solubility of kafirin. Subsequent heat drying at 40 °C was shown to cause the kafirin to aggregate as indicated by an increase in intermolecular β-sheets. Extraction of the flour using ethanol (70%, w/w) with 0.5% (w/w) sodium metabisulfite and 0.35% (w/w) sodium hydroxide at 70 °C followed by freeze-drying of the protein was found to produce a yield of 54% kafirin with good film-forming properties. The kafirin films were assessed for their sensory properties, tensile strength, strain, and water vapor permeability. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to study the secondary structure of the extracted kafirins. The best films were made with kafirin containing a large proportion of nativelike α-helical structures with little intermolecular β-sheet content as indicated by the Fourier transform infrared reflectance peak intensity ratios associated with these secondary structures. The principal factor affecting the secondary structure of the protein appeared to be the temperature at which the protein was dried. Heat drying resulted in a greater proportion of intermolecular β-sheets.

The results showed that, in all cases, threefold rotational motion of the methoxyl and methyl groups dominate their proton spin–lattice (T1 and T1ρ) relaxation processes at low temperatures. In the crystalline solids the only other process observed to affect T1ρ was water rotation. In the glasses both water rotation and anisotropic rotation of whole sugar molecules was observed. The anisotropic rotation, which was responsible for T1ρ relaxation, gave way to a more isotropic rotation at about 50 K above Tg that was responsible for T1 relaxation. In general the dynamics of the systems could be described by a model which used discrete correlation times and an Arrhenius temperature dependence for motion. There was no need for recourse to a distribution of correlation times model. The results obtained suggest that both the motion of methyl groups and water are not coupled to the motion of the whole sugar molecules and that a correlation time diagram for the motions of whole molecules above Tg and for water and methyl groups below Tg can be prepared.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tang, H.

The dry powders were redissolved in sodium phosphate buffers at pH 3.0, 6.5, or 8.0 and at ionic strengths of 0.1 or 1.0 M to a concentration of 0.1% (w/v). Emulsions formed by sonication of protein solutions with n-hexadecane were aged at room temperature and separated into aqueous, interstitial, and interfacial phases. The distinct emulsion components were lyophilized and analyzed by RP-HPLC. A protein was observed to be preferentially located in the interfacial component and subsequently purified from a total albumin fraction and identified by N-terminal sequencing as CM3, an α-amylase inhibitor subunit. Measurement of the equilibrium surface tension of CM3 as a function of protein concentration demonstrated that it was at least as active as bovine β-lactoglobulin, an established protein emulsifier. Furthermore, measurement of the surface dilational elastic modulus at an air/water interface demonstrated the formation of a viscoelastic film, while fluorescence and FT-IR spectroscopic measurements on adsorbed and nonadsorbed CM3 suggest that the secondary structure is essentially unchanged upon adsorption to an oil/water interface. It is concluded that functional screening is a valid approach to identify novel protein emulsifiers in complex mixtures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gilbert, Simon M.","Burnett, Gary R.","Mills, E. N.

The spectra of the dry peptides are very similar; at low water contents (\u003c76% relative humidity) there is an increase in β-sheet structures in all peptides. However, on further hydration the content of β sheets decrease and more β turns are observed. The changes during the second step of hydration are very marked in the 21 and 45 residue peptides, but they are less apparent in the longer perfect repeat peptides. In the 110 and 203 residue peptides hydration results in increased contents of intermolecular β-sheets and less β-turn formation. In contrast, the β-turn content of the Mr 58,000 peptide increases during the second hydration step. The decreased extent of structure changes with increasing chain length indicates that cumulative intermolecular interactions, in particular hydrogen bonds, are an important factor in determining the structures in the solid state. The regularity of the perfect repeat sequences in the 21, 45, 110, and 203 residue peptides may favor the formation of larger stretches of intermolecular β sheets. In contrast, the Mr 58,000 peptide contains imperfect repeats (in common with native glutenin subunits), which may limit its ability to form intermolecular β sheets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Feeney, K.

These form a continuous proteinaceous matrix in the cells of the mature dry grain and are brought together to form a continuous viscoelastic network when flour is mixed with water to form dough. These viscoelastic properties underpin the utilization of wheat to give bread and other processed foods. One group of gluten proteins, the HMM subunits of glutenin, is particularly important in conferring high levels of elasticity (i.e. dough strength). These proteins are present in HMM polymers that are stabilized by disulphide bonds and are considered to form the ‘elastic backbone’ of gluten. However, the glutamine–rich repetitive sequences that comprise the central parts of the HMM subunits also form extensive arrays of interchain hydrogen bonds that may contribute to the elastic properties via a ‘loop and train’ mechanism. Genetic engineering can be used to manipulate the amount and composition of the HMM subunits, leading to either increased dough strength or to more drastic changes in gluten structure and properties.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shewry, P.

However, full-length SBDS orthologs function in a species-specific manner, indicating that the knowledge obtained from model systems may be of limited use in understanding major unresolved issues regarding SBDS function, namely, the effect of mutations in human SBDS on its biochemical function and the specificity of RNA interaction. We determined the solution structure and backbone dynamics of the human SBDS protein and describe its RNA binding site using NMR spectroscopy. Similarly to the crystal structures of Archaea, the overall structure of human SBDS comprises three well-folded domains. However, significant conformational exchange was observed in NMR dynamics experiments for the flexible linker between the N-terminal domain and the central domain, and these experiments also reflect the relative motions of the domains. RNA titrations monitored by heteronuclear correlation experiments and chemical shift mapping analysis identified a classic RNA binding site at the N-terminal FYSH (fungal, Yhr087wp, Shwachman) domain that concentrates most of the mutations described for the human SBDS.","bibo:AuthorList":["de Oliveira, Juliana Ferreira","Sforça, Maurício L.","Blumenschein, Tharin","Goldfeder, Mauricio B.","Guimarães, Beatriz G.","Oliveira, Carla Columbano","Zanchin, Nilson I.T.","Zeri, Ana-Carolina"],"dc:date":"2010-01-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2769012,"sim:weight":0.248419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5454615,"sim:weight":0.246637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47262,"sim:weight":0.24552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49193,"sim:weight":0.243357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.231108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.225008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24487,"sim:weight":0.223568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.220879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7373496,"sim:weight":0.205301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.197812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154372,"sim:weight":0.195878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769016,"sim:weight":0.191611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387413,"sim:weight":0.187505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.184946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.174389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.173935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.172155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709941,"sim:weight":0.165298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709980,"sim:weight":0.159914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225578,"sim:weight":0.159428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Micronemal proteins (MICs) are released onto the parasite surface just before invasion of host cells and play important roles in host cell recognition, attachment and penetration. Here, we report the atomic structure for a key MIC, TgMIC1, and reveal a novel cell-binding motif called the microneme adhesive repeat (MAR). Using glycoarray analyses, we identified a novel interaction with sialylated oligosaccharides that resolves several prevailing misconceptions concerning TgMIC1. Structural studies of various complexes between TgMIC1 and sialylated oligosaccharides provide high-resolution insights into the recognition of sialylated oligosaccharides by a parasite surface protein. We observe that MAR domains exist in tandem repeats, which provide a highly specialized structure for glycan discrimination. Our work uncovers new features of parasite–receptor interactions at the early stages of host cell invasion, which will assist the design of new therapeutic strategies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Blumenschein, T.M.A.","Friedrich, Nikolas","Childs, Robert A","Saouros, Savvas","Carpenter, Elisabeth P","Campanero-Rhodes, Maria A","Simpson, Peter","Chai, Wengang","Koutroukides, Theodoros","Blackman, Michael J","Feizi, Ten","Soldati-Favre, Dominique","Matthews, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2007-05-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":57421,"sim:weight":0.338295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81307,"sim:weight":0.298394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643950,"sim:weight":0.277175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":794227,"sim:weight":0.275876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9022919,"sim:weight":0.193712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9022959,"sim:weight":0.19167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.178406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26480,"sim:weight":0.161451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80376,"sim:weight":0.149043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1395095,"sim:weight":0.148776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":586802,"sim:weight":0.147173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24079,"sim:weight":0.140369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661446,"sim:weight":0.140329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384027,"sim:weight":0.130586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":837610,"sim:weight":0.128171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931557,"sim:weight":0.123906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929888,"sim:weight":0.121446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101909,"sim:weight":0.0968237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768451,"sim:weight":0.0951414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146199,"sim:weight":0.0905821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These changes propagate to tropomyosin (Tm), which then assumes a new disposition with respect to actin, reversibly exposing actin\u0027s binding sites for the thick filament motor-ATPase (myosin). To date, the structural biology of thin filament regulation has been studied in the context of two equilibrium states corresponding to high (contraction-activated) and low (contraction-inhibited) sarcomeric [Ca2+]. New electron micrographic reconstructions of the thin filament have resolved Tn, actin, and Tm in high and low [Ca2+] states, integrating high-resolution structures of the Tn core, actin, and Tm. The resultant picture of thin filament regulation does not resolve all of the functionally significant portions of troponin I (TnI) or troponin C (TnC). Those regions of Tn have been shown (using NMR relaxation spectroscopy) to undergo conformational fluctuations, rationalizing the absence of these regions from micrograph-based reconstructions. The disordered portions of Tn are, to date, being interpreted within a canonical structure–activity paradigm.\r\n\r\nHere we present a new mechanism for the regulation of Tn having explicit descriptions of the kinetic pathways of activation and inhibition. Our thesis is that the intrinsic disorder of TnI is mechanistically significant. As the coupling of folding to binding has been shown to confer an inherent kinetic advantage (known as flycasting activity), our thesis accounts for TnI\u0027s conformational heterogeneity and known structure–activity relationships in a parsimonious fashion. We integrate recent NMR structures of the C-terminus of TnI and NMR observations of the conformational dynamics of the Tn complex into high-resolution models of the thin filament. Ways of evaluating the mechanism are discussed. The novel conceptual framework presented here prompts new hypotheses regarding the mechanism of pH sensitivity and of pathogenic mutations in troponin.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hoffman, Ryan M.B.","Blumenschein, T.M.A.","Sykes, Brian D."],"dc:date":"2006-07-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":97985,"sim:weight":0.217248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154266,"sim:weight":0.183377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710180,"sim:weight":0.18322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.177694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5717325,"sim:weight":0.172418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43026,"sim:weight":0.165479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387283,"sim:weight":0.163085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.155801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710084,"sim:weight":0.150461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998928,"sim:weight":0.148513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387413,"sim:weight":0.147026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.146382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.14405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9412685,"sim:weight":0.142829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43059,"sim:weight":0.138577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24487,"sim:weight":0.134892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.133743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85814,"sim:weight":0.127153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.125268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43976,"sim:weight":0.124897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, there are domains important for actin binding that are not visualized. We present evidence that the C-terminal region of troponin I (TnI residues 135–182) is flexible in solution and has no stable secondary structure. We use NMR spectroscopy to observe the backbone dynamics of skeletal [2H, 13C, 15N]-TnI in the troponin complex in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA/Mg2+. Residues in this region give stronger signals than the remainder of TnI, and chemical shift index values indicate little secondary structure, suggesting a very flexible region. This is confirmed by NMR relaxation measurements. Unlike TnC and other regions of TnI in the complex, the C-terminal region of TnI is not affected by Ca2+ binding. Relaxation measurements and reduced spectral density analysis are consistent with the C-terminal region of TnI being a tethered domain connected to the rest of the troponin complex by a flexible linker, residues 137–146, followed by a collapsed region with at most nascent secondary structure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Blumenschein, T.M.A","Stone, D.B.","Fletterick, R.J.","Mendelson, R.A.","Sykes, B.D."],"dc:date":"2006-10-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":7373496,"sim:weight":0.191041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4885840,"sim:weight":0.187791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.185756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5717325,"sim:weight":0.175975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4879613,"sim:weight":0.173333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.165092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24487,"sim:weight":0.164204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769012,"sim:weight":0.162953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47262,"sim:weight":0.157447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387413,"sim:weight":0.155681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154266,"sim:weight":0.155413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98502,"sim:weight":0.148745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.143862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848862,"sim:weight":0.143762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43026,"sim:weight":0.142712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269867,"sim:weight":0.137555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24894,"sim:weight":0.134817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.134573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.130595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.130551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We used NMR techniques to study the backbone dynamics of skeletal troponin C (TnC) in the complex. Transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy pulse sequences and deuteration of TnC were essential to assign most of the TnC residues in the complex. Backbone amide 15N relaxation times were measured in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA/Mg2+. T1 relaxation times could not be interpreted precisely, because for a molecule of this size, the longitudinal backbone amide 15N relaxation rate due to chemical shift anisotropy and dipole-dipole interactions becomes too small, and other relaxation mechanisms become relevant. T2 relaxation times were of the expected magnitude for a complex of this size, and most of the variation of T2 times in the presence of Ca2+ could be explained by the anisotropy of the complex, suggesting a relatively rigid molecule. The only exception was EF-hand site III and helix F immediately after, which are more flexible than the rest of the molecule. In the presence of EGTA/Mg2+, relaxation times for residues in the C-domain of TnC are very similar to values in the presence of Ca2+, whereas the N-domain becomes more flexible.

The interactions among the components of the troponin complex (troponins T, C, and I) are essential to understanding the regulation of muscle contraction. While the structure of TnC is well known, and a model for the binary TnC·TnI complex has been recently published (Tung, C.-S., Wall, M. E., Gallagher, S. C., and Trewhella, J. (2000)Protein Sci. 9, 1312–1326), very little is known about TnT. Using non-denaturing gels and NMR spectroscopy, we have analyzed the interactions between TnC and five peptides from TnT as well as how three TnI peptides affect these interactions. Rabbit fast skeletal muscle peptide TnT-(160–193) binds to TnC with a dissociation constant of 30 ± 6 μm.

All possible combinations of the three mutations were produced. The single mutants D5S and D9E and the double mutant D5S/D9E have low affinity for Ca2+. All the mutants containing mutation D12E are Ca2+-specific and have higher affinities than wild type, even when containing mutations D5S or D9E. All of the mutants studied have lower affinity for Mg2+ than the wild-type protein. As expected, the changes in binding free energy that each mutant produces depend on the residues present at the other positions of the site, since the mutated positions are very close in the protein structure. Coupling energies are about the same for all pairs of mutants when binding Ca2+, but can have different values when binding Mg2+. D5S and D9E have a large negative coupling energy for Mg2+ binding which suggests an interaction between these two positions. When mutation D12E is present, the coupling energy for Mg2+ binding between D5S and D9E is much lower, suggesting that this interaction occurs only if an aspartate is in position 12.

NrfA catalyses the reduction of NO2− to NH4+ through a six electron reduction pathway that is of major physiological significance to the anaerobic metabolism of enteric and sulfate reducing bacteria. NrfA receives electrons from the 21 kDa pentahaem NrfB donor protein. This requires that redox complexes form between the NrfA and NrfB pentahaem cytochromes. The formation of these complexes can be monitored using a range of methodologies for studying protein–protein interactions, including dynamic light scattering, gel filtration, analytical ultracentrifugation and visible spectroscopy. These methods have been used to show that oxidized NrfA exists in dynamic monomer–dimer equilibrium with a Kd (dissociation constant) of 4 μM. Significantly, the monomeric and dimeric forms of NrfA are equally active for either the six electron reduction of NO2− or HSO3−. When mixed together, NrfA and NrfB exist in equilibrium with NrfAB, which is described by a Kd of 50 nM.

However, certain environments present particular challenges. Aerobic metabolism of highly reduced carbon substrates by soil bacteria such as Paracoccus pantotrophus presents one such challenge since it may result in excessive electron delivery to the respiratory redox chain when compared with the availability of terminal oxidant, O2. The level of a periplasmic ubiquinol-dependent nitrate reductase, NAP, is up-regulated in the presence of highly reduced carbon substrates. NAP oxidizes ubiquinol at the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane and reduces nitrate in the periplasm. Thus its activity counteracts the accumulation of excess reducing equivalents in ubiquinol, thereby maintaining the redox poise of the ubiquinone/ubiquinol pool without contributing to the protonmotive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. Although P. pantotrophus NapAB shows a high level of substrate specificity towards nitrate, the enzyme has also been reported to reduce selenate in spectrophotometric solution assays. This transaction draws on our current knowledge concerning the bacterial respiratory nitrate reductases and extends the application of PFE (protein film electrochemistry) to resolve and quantify the selenate reductase activity of NapAB.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gates, AJ","Butler, CS","Richardson, DJ","Butt, JN"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4870225,"sim:weight":0.178366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4877016,"sim:weight":0.163756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.143841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.137235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.136806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229189,"sim:weight":0.129188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381911,"sim:weight":0.119666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495238,"sim:weight":0.117406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769012,"sim:weight":0.117178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.116423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46909,"sim:weight":0.110405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384221,"sim:weight":0.109957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146021,"sim:weight":0.109315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4868971,"sim:weight":0.101078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5228600,"sim:weight":0.100667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4894185,"sim:weight":0.100011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46906,"sim:weight":0.0992554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.0975098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4876220,"sim:weight":0.0915829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108030,"sim:weight":0.09153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here, we illustrate this approach with spectroelectrochemical studies of Rhodovulum sulfidophilum cytochrome c 2 and Escherichia coli cytochrome bd that employ electronic absorbance, infra-red and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Male, Louise","Marritt, Sophie","Berks, Ben C.","Cheesman, Myles","Van Wonderen, Jessica","George, Simon J.","Butt, Julea"],"dc:date":"2007-01-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2769050,"sim:weight":0.269703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870624,"sim:weight":0.256102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002276,"sim:weight":0.221188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84831,"sim:weight":0.217414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4878695,"sim:weight":0.216501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.203777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102229,"sim:weight":0.191017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.175375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44440,"sim:weight":0.169402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46508,"sim:weight":0.169234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11481,"sim:weight":0.149299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205917,"sim:weight":0.146769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98875,"sim:weight":0.145358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45642,"sim:weight":0.138166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108030,"sim:weight":0.138108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47635,"sim:weight":0.133392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183181,"sim:weight":0.132394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43252,"sim:weight":0.129731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9412749,"sim:weight":0.128636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2971,"sim:weight":0.126583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A ferredoxin that serves as the physiological electron donor to the nitrate and nitrite reductases in this assimilatory process has been characterized. The ferredoxin was found to contain approximately two atoms of iron and two atoms of sulphur, indicative of the binding of a [2Fe–2S] cluster. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the reduced form of the protein displayed a rhombic signal, with gx\u003d1.91, gy\u003d1.98, gz\u003d2.07, that shows considerable similarity to plant and algal [2Fe–2S] ferredoxins. UV-visible spectropotentiometric analysis determined a midpoint redox potential for the [2Fe–2S]2+/1+ transition of around −285 mV vs. SHE that was independent of salt concentration. UV-visible spectroscopy was also used to establish that the [2Fe–2S] cluster integrity of this protein was maintained over the pH range 5–11. Significantly, the Haloferax mediterranei ferredoxin was shown to be a highly thermostable protein. It was stable up to 60 °C in a low-salt (0.2 M) medium and this increased to 80 °C in a high-salt (4 M) medium. This thermostability at high salt concentration is an essential physiological characteristic because haloarchaea are mainly found in environments where high temperatures and concentrated salt water occur.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martinez-Espinosa, Rosa Maria","Richardson, David","Butt, Julea","Bonete, Mari­a José"],"dc:date":"2007-10-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145640,"sim:weight":0.211857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26920,"sim:weight":0.189518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.184451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.165977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1131664,"sim:weight":0.14463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225460,"sim:weight":0.142603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.142431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2971,"sim:weight":0.142009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205917,"sim:weight":0.141288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1008876,"sim:weight":0.137498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710587,"sim:weight":0.136682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381911,"sim:weight":0.135068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98866,"sim:weight":0.13334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101411,"sim:weight":0.131704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26064,"sim:weight":0.130414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.1259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229182,"sim:weight":0.121111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764026,"sim:weight":0.117931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.116856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146021,"sim:weight":0.115557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Despite our familiarity with these proteins, defining the functional role of a given heme can still present considerable challenges. In this situation, magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) is a technique of choice because it has the capacity to define heme oxidation, spin, and ligation states in solution and at ambient temperature. Unfortunately, the resolving power of MCD rarely has been brought to bare on the intermediate redox states accessible to multiheme proteins. This is due in large part to the time-consuming procedure of magnetic field cycling required each time a sample is introduced into the magnet and the risk that control over, and knowledge of, the potential will be lost between sample preparation and spectral acquisition. Here we present a solution to this problem in the form of MCD-compatible optically transparent thin-layer electrochemistry (MOTTLE). MOTTLE defines redox behavior for cytochrome c in good agreement with the literature. In addition, MOTTLE reproduces the redox-driven transformation of heme ligand sets reported for cytochrome bd. Thus, MOTTLE provides a robust analytical tool for the dissection of heme properties with resolution across the electrochemical potential domain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marritt, Sophie","Van Wonderen, Jessica","Cheesman, Myles","Butt, Julea"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.304743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.1709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81367,"sim:weight":0.170278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387384,"sim:weight":0.159809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183181,"sim:weight":0.158805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98714,"sim:weight":0.153657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51414,"sim:weight":0.147619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4896009,"sim:weight":0.14631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45642,"sim:weight":0.146142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46508,"sim:weight":0.144414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661446,"sim:weight":0.14089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84831,"sim:weight":0.139903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1625899,"sim:weight":0.138759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2971,"sim:weight":0.134994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1602292,"sim:weight":0.134007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99445,"sim:weight":0.13281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934790,"sim:weight":0.132026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205917,"sim:weight":0.128474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.127675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495238,"sim:weight":0.124479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The adsorbed NrfA has been imaged to molecular resolution by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (in situ STM) under full electrochemical potential control and under conditions where the enzyme is electrocatalytically active. Details of the density and orientational distribution of NrfA molecules are disclosed. The submonolayer coverage resolved by in situ STM is readily reconciled with the failure to detect nonturnover signals in cyclic voltammetry of the NrfA films. The molecular structures show a range of lateral dimensions. These are suggestive of a distribution of orientations that could account for the otherwise anomalously low turnover number calculated for the total population of adsorbed NrfA molecules when compared with that determined for solutions of NrfA.

By comparison, at pH 4, catalysis is initiated at more positive electrode potentials in an approximately sigmoidal fashion with no attenuation of the catalytic rate evident at more negative electrode potentials. The results show that activity is turned on by the coupled transfer of two electrons and one proton to the enzyme. The decreased rate of catalysis at lower electrode potentials under more alkaline conditions shows that this rate attenuation occurs only when reduction is not coupled to compensating protonation(s) of the enzyme.

The results demonstrate the simplicity of integrating electrochemical detection with hairpin based biosensors and illustrate a new approach to the assay of DNA ligases, of which the NAD+-dependent enzymes represent a potential broad spectrum antibacterial drug target.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zauner, Gerhild","Wang, Yating","Lavesa-Curto, Manuel","MacDonald, Andrew","Mayes, Andrew","Bowater, Richard P.","Butt, Julea"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929813,"sim:weight":0.474717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755414,"sim:weight":0.445264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880394,"sim:weight":0.407596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2756678,"sim:weight":0.383614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2717111,"sim:weight":0.38192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755738,"sim:weight":0.337466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2756289,"sim:weight":0.331608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710687,"sim:weight":0.325319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2756096,"sim:weight":0.32166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761091,"sim:weight":0.312694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766970,"sim:weight":0.307407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154372,"sim:weight":0.234563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2756887,"sim:weight":0.212498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1559905,"sim:weight":0.206938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44440,"sim:weight":0.18756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13171,"sim:weight":0.187514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316476,"sim:weight":0.173974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113906,"sim:weight":0.173813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1108274,"sim:weight":0.172738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84831,"sim:weight":0.168128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The contrasting effects of two inhibitors on the activity of this enzyme have been revealed, and defined, by protein film voltammetry (PFV). Azide inhibition is rapid and reversible. Variation of the catalytic current magnitude describes mixed inhibition in which azide binds to the Michaelis complex ( 40 mM) with a lower affinity than to the enzyme alone ( 15 mM) and leads to complete inhibition of enzyme activity. The position of the catalytic wave reports tighter binding of azide when the active site is oxidized ( 39 μM) than when it is reduced. By contrast, binding and release of cyanide are sluggish. The higher affinity of cyanide for reduced versus oxidized forms of nitrite reductase is immediately revealed, as is the presence of two sites for cyanide binding and inhibition of the enzyme. Formation of the monocyano complex by reduction of the enzyme followed by a “rapid” scan to high potentials captures the activity−potential profile of this enzyme form and shows it to be distinct from that of the uninhibited enzyme. The biscyano complex is inactive. These studies demonstrate the complexity that can be associated with inhibitor binding to redox enzymes and illustrate how PFV readily captures and deconvolves this complexity through its impact on the catalytic properties of the enzyme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gwyer, James D.","Richardson, David J.","Butt, Julea"],"dc:date":"2005-11-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2769712,"sim:weight":0.347226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44440,"sim:weight":0.293814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46683,"sim:weight":0.268145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870225,"sim:weight":0.257186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.252247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.245821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316361,"sim:weight":0.244158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9412637,"sim:weight":0.23629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769050,"sim:weight":0.23022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870806,"sim:weight":0.228892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.221658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710562,"sim:weight":0.219684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585842,"sim:weight":0.218119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154323,"sim:weight":0.213617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4878695,"sim:weight":0.212324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43583,"sim:weight":0.201913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.196622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9412685,"sim:weight":0.196253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769012,"sim:weight":0.176885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108030,"sim:weight":0.16751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the present study the ferredoxin-dependent nitrate reductase NarB of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 was analyzed by spectropotentiometry and protein film voltammetry. Metal and acid-labile sulfide analysis revealed nearest integer values of 4:4:1 (iron/sulfur/molybdenum)/molecule of NarB. Analysis of dithionite-reduced enzyme by low temperature EPR revealed at 10 K the presence of a signal that is characteristic of a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster. EPR-monitored potentiometric titration of NarB revealed that this cluster titrated as an n \u003d 1 Nernstian component with a midpoint redox potential (Em) of –190 mV. EPR spectra collected at 60 K revealed a Mo(V) signal termed “very high g” with gav \u003d 2.0047 in air-oxidized enzyme that accounted for only 10–20% of the total molybdenum. This signal disappeared upon reduction with dithionite, and a new “high g” species (gav \u003d 1.9897) was observed. In potentiometric titrations the high g Mo(V) signal developed over the potential range of –100 to –350 mV (Em Mo6+/5+ \u003d –150 mV), and when fully developed, it accounted for 1 mol of Mo(V)/mol of enzyme. Protein film voltammetry of NarB revealed that activity is turned on at potentials below –200 mV, where the cofactors are predominantly [4Fe-4S]1+ and Mo5+. The data suggests that during the catalytic cycle nitrate will bind to the Mo5+ state of NarB in which the enzyme is minimally two-electron-reduced. Comparison of the spectral properties of NarB with those of the membrane-bound and periplasmic respiratory nitrate reductases reveals that it is closely related to the periplasmic enzyme, but the potential of the molybdenum center of NarB is tuned to operate at lower potentials, consistent with the coupling of NarB to low potential ferredoxins in the cell cytoplasm.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jepson, B.

Cytochrome c nitrite reductase clearly interacts differently with these two substrates.

The structure is the first for a member of the NrfA subgroup that utilize a soluble penta-heme cytochrome, NrfB, as a redox partner. Comparison to the structures of Wolinella succinogenes NrfA and Sulfospirillum deleyianum NrfA, which accept electrons from a membrane-anchored tetra-heme cytochrome (NrfH), reveals notable differences in the protein surface around heme 2, which may be the docking site for the redox partner. The structure shows that four of the NrfA hemes (hemes 2−5) have bis-histidine axial heme-Fe ligation. The catalytic heme-Fe (heme 1) has a lysine distal ligand and an oxygen atom proximal ligand. Analysis of NrfA in solution by magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) suggested that the oxygen ligand arose from water. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were collected from electrochemically poised NrfA samples. Broad perpendicular mode signals at g  10.8 and 3.5, characteristic of weakly spin-coupled S \u003d 5/2, S \u003d 1/2 paramagnets, titrated with Em \u003d −107 mV.

Here we show that the square-wave voltammetric peak position of methylene blue complexed to thiol-terminated single-stranded oligonucleotides immobilised on gold electrodes differs from that of methylene blue complexed to thiol-terminated double-stranded oligonucleotides immobilised on gold electrodes. The peak potential of methylene blue at the single-stranded oligonucleotide array was consistently found to occur at potentials ca. 10–15 mV more positive than that at double-stranded oligonucleotide arrays, the precise difference being dependent on the direction of the voltammetry. This voltammetric behaviour mirrors that found for methylene blue bound to freely diffusing single- and double-stranded calf thymus DNA and suggests that the immobilised oligonucleotides retain the methylene blue binding properties of their freely diffusing counterparts. Thus methylene blue provides a simple electrochemical indicator for the status of oligonucleotide-functionalised gold surfaces.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tani, Akiko","Thomson, Andrew J.","Butt, Julea"],"dc:date":"2001-09-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Th are typically sequences of nucleotides between 21-25 nucleotides in length. They are known to play a key role in gene regulation. The identification, clustering and classification of sRNA has recently become the focus of much research activity. The basic problem involves detecting regions of interest on the chromosome where the pattern of candidate matches is somehow unusual. Currently, there are no published algorithms for detecting regions of interest, and the unpublished methods that we are aware of involve bespoke rule based systems designed for a specific organism. Work in this very new field has understandably focused on the outcomes rather than the methods used to obtain the results. In this paper we propose two generic approaches that place the specific biological problem in the wider context of time series data mining problems. Both methods are based on treating the occurrences on a chromosome, or “hit count” data, as a time series, then running a sliding window along a chromosome and measuring unusualness. This formulation means we can treat finding unusual areas of candidate RNA activity as a variety of time series anomaly detection problem. The first set of approaches is model based. We specify a null hypothesis distribution for not being a sRNA, then estimate the p-values along the chromosome. The second approach is instance based. We identify some typical shapes from known sRNA, then use dynamic time warping and fourier trans-form based distance to measure how closely the candidate series matches. We demonstrate that these methods can find known sRNA on Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes and illustrate the benefits of the added information provided by these algorithms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bagnall, A","Moxon, S","Studholme, D"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2761121,"sim:weight":0.499571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.433606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":240751,"sim:weight":0.42397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183147,"sim:weight":0.421405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4896009,"sim:weight":0.414739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.387439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.367514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.346138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper evaluates a method of over-coming the detrimental effects of outliers. We describe some of the alternative approaches to clustering time series, then specify a particular class of model for experimentation with k-means clustering and a correlation based distance metric. For data derived from this class of model we demonstrate that discretising the data into a binary series of above and below the median improves the clustering when the data has outliers. More specifically, we show that firstly discretisation does not significantly effect the accuracy of the clusters when there are no outliers and secondly it significantly increases the accuracy in the presence of outliers, even when the probability of outlier is very low.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bagnall, AJ","Janacek, GJ","Zhang, M"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Diagnostics of upper-ocean currents and mixing are sensitive to the small-scale variability in the high-resolution regional atmospheric model. The hydrographic state of the ocean model is insensitive over the month-long experiments, however. Both sea ice and the fluxes of volume, heat, and freshwater across the east Greenland shelf break and through the Denmark Strait show a moderate response to the high-resolution atmospheric forcing. The synoptic-scale atmospheric state has a large role in controlling sea ice too, while internal ocean dynamics is the dominant factor controlling the flux diagnostics. It is the high spatial resolution, not the temporal resolution, that causes these effects, with O(10 km)-scale features being most important. The sea-level wind field is responsible, with the other atmospheric fields playing relatively minor roles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haine, TWN","Zhang, S","Moore, GWK","Renfrew, IA"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2771055,"sim:weight":0.524816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771059,"sim:weight":0.475897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771524,"sim:weight":0.393395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2782580,"sim:weight":0.387498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771054,"sim:weight":0.378661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771431,"sim:weight":0.356213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773321,"sim:weight":0.310102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In Part I of this article aircraft observations were described. Now, in Part II, numerical simulations and an analysis of the dynamical forcing mechanisms are presented. The simulations make use of a limited-area 12 km resolution configuration of the Met Office\u0027s Unified Model. Sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice concentrations have been replaced using the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) product, addressing a boundary-layer temperature bias, while roughness lengths over sea ice have been updated, addressing a wind-speed bias. These modifications ensured a reasonably accurate simulation: generally within 1–2 K and 2–3 m s−1 when compared with dropsonde observations. A momentum-budget analysis along a curved locus through the core of the jet has been derived. Off southeast Greenland, the easterly tip jet was in cross-jet geostrophic balance, but was being accelerated downstream by an along-jet pressure gradient. Over the curved part of the locus, as the jet rounded Cape Farewell, a cross-jet residual suggests that the jet was unbalanced at the height of the jet core. This residual decreases with height so that an approximate gradient wind balance applies in the upper part of the jet. The anticyclonic curvature, characteristic of easterly tip jets, was caused by a dramatic decrease in the cross-jet pressure-gradient force at the end of the barrier, after which the jet aligned with the synoptic-scale isobars and returned to approximate geostrophic balance. The momentum budget is shown to be robust and applicable to other cases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Outten, SD","Renfrew, IA","Petersen, GN"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2771054,"sim:weight":0.708099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771059,"sim:weight":0.587302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773321,"sim:weight":0.334149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The easterly tip jet of 21 February 2007 took place during the Greenland Flow Distortion experiment. It resulted through the interaction of a barotropic synoptic-scale low pressure system in the central North Atlantic and the high topography of southern Greenland. In situ observations reveal a jet core at the coast with peak winds of almost 50 m s−1, about 600–800 m above the sea surface, and of 30 m s−1 at 10 m. The depth of the jet increased with wind speed from ∼1500 m to ∼2500 m as the peak winds increased from 30 to 50 m s−1. The jet accelerated and curved anticyclonically as it reached Cape Farewell and the end of the barrier. The easterly tip jet was associated with a tongue of cold and dry air along the coast of southeast Greenland, general cloud cover to the east, and cloud streets to the south of Cape Farewell. Precipitation was observed during the low-level components of the flight. The very high wind speeds generated a highly turbulent atmospheric boundary layer and resulted in some of the highest surface wind stresses ever observed over the ocean.","bibo:AuthorList":["Renfrew, IA","Outten, SD","Moore, GWK"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2771053,"sim:weight":0.708099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771431,"sim:weight":0.605147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771055,"sim:weight":0.532491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2782580,"sim:weight":0.503126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771524,"sim:weight":0.472119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773321,"sim:weight":0.444129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43343,"sim:weight":0.402067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771045,"sim:weight":0.378661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.303799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.221404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.208029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Only two out of the five cases showed clear forecast improvement; the maximum forecast improvement seen over the verifying region was approximately 5% of the forecast error 24 hours into the forecast. These two cases are presented in more detail: in the first the improvement propagates into the verification region with a developing polar low; and in the second the improvement is associated with an upper-level trough. The impact of cycling targeted data in the background of the forecast (including the memory of previous targeted observations) is investigated.

During this time period the barrier flow increased from a narrow jet, ∼15 m s−1, to a jet filling almost the whole of the Denmark Strait with maximum wind speed exceeding 40 m s−1. Dropsonde observations show that the barrier flow was capped by a sharp temperature inversion below mountain height. Below the inversion was a cold and dry jet, with a larger northerly wind component than that of the flow above, which was also warmer and more moist. Thus, the observations indicate two air masses below mountain height: a cold and dry barrier jet of northern origin and, above this, a warmer and moister air mass that was of cyclonic origin.\r\n\r\nNumerical simulations emphasize the non-stationarity of the Greenland barrier flow and its dependence on the synoptic situation in the Greenland--Iceland region. They show that the barrier jet originated north of the Denmark Strait and was drawn southward by a synoptic-scale cyclone, with the strength and location of the maximum winds highly dependent on the location of the cyclone relative to the orography of Greenland. Experiments without Greenland\u0027s orography suggest a ∼20 m s−1 enhancement of the low-level peak wind speeds due to the presence of the barrier.

New geochemical (particularly stable isotope) data shows that cementation of the chalks, although related spatially to the solution features, was not caused by glacier-derived waters. The carbon isotope composition of the chalk cements is typically around −9.5‰, indicative of biologically active soils. Moreover, the oxygen isotope compositions of the cements, around −5‰, are incompatible with water δ18O values much below −9 to −10‰ (which probably precludes isotopically negative glacier-derived water), as resulting palaeo-temperatures are below zero. Taken together, the isotope data suggest chalk cementation occurred under interglacial conditions similar to the present.

A number of mechanisms have been suggested: 1) forcing by equatorial waves; 2) enhanced monsoon moisture supply; and 3) increased African easterly wave (AEW) activity. However, previous observational studies are not able to unambiguously distinguish between cause and effect. Carefully designed model experiments are used to assess these mechanisms. Intraseasonal convective anomalies over West Africa during the summer monsoon season are simulated in an atmosphere-only global circulation model as a response to imposed sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies associated with the MJO over the equatorial warm pool region. 1) Negative SST anomalies stabilize the atmosphere leading to locally reduced convection. The reduced convection leads to negative midtropospheric latent heating anomalies that force dry equatorial waves. These waves propagate eastward (Kelvin wave) and westward (Rossby wave), reaching Africa approximately 10 days later. The associated negative temperature anomalies act to destabilize the atmosphere, resulting in enhanced monsoon convection over West and central Africa. The Rossby waves are found to be the most important component, with associated westward-propagating convective anomalies over West Africa. The eastward-propagating equatorial Kelvin wave also efficiently triggers convection over the eastern Pacific and Central America, consistent with observations. 2) An increase in boundary layer moisture is found to occur as a result of the forced convective anomalies over West Africa rather than a cause. 3) Increased shear on the African easterly jet, leading to increased AEW activity, is also found to occur as a result of the forced convective anomalies in the model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lavender, SL","Matthews, AJ"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2767047,"sim:weight":0.815884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769383,"sim:weight":0.698298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772852,"sim:weight":0.672588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769392,"sim:weight":0.668784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768886,"sim:weight":0.608455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769372,"sim:weight":0.58645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769382,"sim:weight":0.573337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766119,"sim:weight":0.567872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711834,"sim:weight":0.525503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768869,"sim:weight":0.492135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771792,"sim:weight":0.481876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.44976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30697,"sim:weight":0.431944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.429954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31928,"sim:weight":0.423545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.421254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29494,"sim:weight":0.414275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31910,"sim:weight":0.392054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31926,"sim:weight":0.387975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31935,"sim:weight":0.387306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The real-time seismic amplitude (RSAM) shows a narrow, statistically significant, peak within 30 min after the start of intense rainfall events, and a much broader peak with a lag of 6–40 h. The classified seismic events indicate that the volcanic response to rainfall begins at the surface and gradually penetrates deeper into the dome, as there is an increase in the pseudo-magnitude of: surface rockfall events (including pyroclastic flows) with lags from the first 30 min to 40 h, long-period rockfalls (from shallow degassing) at lags of 4 and 14 h, and long-period and hybrid events (source depth approximately 1 km) with lags at 14 and 24 h after the start of rainfall events.

Rates of PP(14CPUR) were \u003c rates of PP(14CSIS), and oxygen uptake in the light was more than 10-fold \u003e oxygen uptake in the dark. The low rates of PP( 14CPUR) in relation to PP(14CSIS) may have resulted from the heterogeneous nature of the bloom and differences in sampling time. However, it is also possible that dissolved organic material (DOM) released by the stressed diatom population restricted the diffusion of 14C into the cells, thereby causing a greater underestimate of PP by techniques using short incubations. The significantly higher rates of oxygen uptake in the light are difficult to reconcile, and we do not know whether the light enhanced oxygen uptake was directly linked to carbon fixation. However, the release of DOM may also have provided substrate for enhanced respiration in the light. These anomalies were only revealed through the concurrent measurement of plankton production by this wide range of techniques. Further investigation of DOM excretion and light-enhanced respiration during diatom blooms is warranted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Robinson, C","Tilstone, GH","Rees, AP","Smyth, TJ","Fishwick, JR","Tarran, GA","Luz, B","Barkan, E","David, E"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2771330,"sim:weight":0.512376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":661158,"sim:weight":0.420357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772698,"sim:weight":0.394564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":731597,"sim:weight":0.375986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1097021,"sim:weight":0.339077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":497393,"sim:weight":0.30926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771289,"sim:weight":0.282242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69777,"sim:weight":0.264637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":885608,"sim:weight":0.247965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The high-resolution versions of the model show an increase in eddy kinetic energy that peaks 2-3 yr after a positive anomaly in the SAM index. Previous work has shown that the instantaneous temperature response to the SAM is characterized by predominant cooling south of 45°S and warming to the north. At all resolutions the model captures this temperature response. This response is also evident in the coarse-resolution implementation of the model with no eddy mixing parameterization, showing that eddies do not play an important role in the instantaneous response. On the longer time scales, an intensification of the mesoscale eddy field occurs, which causes enhanced poleward heat flux and drives warming south of the oceanic Polar Front. This warming is of greater magnitude and occurs for a longer period than the initial cooling response. The results demonstrate that this warming is surface intensified and strongest in the mixed layer. Non-eddy-resolving models are unable to capture the delayed eddy-driven temperature response to the SAM. The authors therefore question the ability of coarse-resolution models, such as those commonly used in climate simulations, to accurately represent the full impacts of the SAM on the Southern Ocean.","bibo:AuthorList":["Screen, JA","Gillet, NP","Stevens, DP","Marshall, GJ","Roscoe, HK"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766152,"sim:weight":0.54226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28620,"sim:weight":0.540377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768928,"sim:weight":0.533714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28135,"sim:weight":0.513373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31918,"sim:weight":0.511663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30695,"sim:weight":0.49084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269883,"sim:weight":0.48908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31934,"sim:weight":0.479361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30697,"sim:weight":0.459605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31869,"sim:weight":0.440957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27356,"sim:weight":0.432268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766154,"sim:weight":0.431138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27273,"sim:weight":0.428518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31937,"sim:weight":0.427827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31927,"sim:weight":0.42231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.420616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.420586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.413886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31939,"sim:weight":0.413728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29477,"sim:weight":0.413646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The transects traversed the North and South Atlantic Subtropical Gyres (N gyre, 18–38°N; S gyre, 11–35°S) in April–June and September–November 2003–2005. The route and timing of the cruises enabled the assessment of the seasonal variability of P, R and P/R in the N and S gyres, and the comparison of the previously unsampled N gyre centre with the more frequently sampled eastern edge of the gyre. Mean euphotic zone integrated rates (±SE) were P\u003d63±23 (n\u003d31), R\u003d69±22 (n\u003d30) mmol O2 m−2 d−1 in the N gyre; and P\u003d58±26 (n\u003d30), R\u003d62±24 (n\u003d30) mmol O2 m−2 d−1 in the S gyre. Overall, the N gyre was heterotrophic (R\u003eP) and it was more heterotrophic than the S gyre, but the metabolic balance of both gyres changed with season. Both gyres were net heterotrophic in autumn, and balanced in spring. This seasonal contrast was most pronounced for the S gyre, because it was more autotrophic than the N gyre during spring. This may have arisen from differences in nitrate availability, because spring sampling in the S gyre coincided with periods of deep mixing to the nitracline, more frequently than spring sampling within the N gyre. Our results indicate that the N gyre is less heterotrophic than previous estimates suggested, and that there is an apparent decrease in R from the eastern edge to the centre of the N gyre, possibly indicative of an allochthonous organic carbon source to the east of the gyre.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gist, N","Serret, P","Woodward, EM","Chamberlain, K","Robinson, C"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":31149,"sim:weight":0.472401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772699,"sim:weight":0.407257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771330,"sim:weight":0.379836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761077,"sim:weight":0.348764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27380,"sim:weight":0.343862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23546,"sim:weight":0.341819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6185529,"sim:weight":0.337226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29435,"sim:weight":0.330155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28218,"sim:weight":0.314154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23541,"sim:weight":0.306284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768779,"sim:weight":0.306053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24791,"sim:weight":0.303231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26714,"sim:weight":0.300667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31145,"sim:weight":0.298112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46530,"sim:weight":0.295476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9630172,"sim:weight":0.29482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767706,"sim:weight":0.287265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771177,"sim:weight":0.282242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.275795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29467,"sim:weight":0.27459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Vertical N2O profiles were amenable to analysis on the basis of common features coincident with Longhurst provinces. In contrast, CH4 showed no such pattern. The most striking feature of the latitudinal depth distributions was a well-defined “plume” of exceptionally high N2O concentrations coincident with very low levels of CH4, located between 23.5°N and 23.5°S; this feature reflects the upwelling of deep waters containing N2O derived from nitrification, as identified by an analysis of N2O, apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) and NO3−, and presumably depleted in CH4 by bacterial oxidation.

The targeted observations were carried out during February and March 2007 as part of the Greenland Flow Distortion Experiment, using a research aircraft based in Iceland. Sensitive area predictions using either total energy singular vectors or an ensemble transform Kalman filter were used to predict where additional observations should be made to reduce errors in the initial conditions of forecasts for northern Europe. Targeted sonde data was assimilated operationally into the MetUM. Hindcasts show that the impact of the sondes was mixed. Only two out of the five cases showed clear forecast improvement; the maximum forecast improvement seen over the verifying region was approximately 5% of the forecast error 24 hours into the forecast. These two cases are presented in more detail: in the first the improvement propagates into the verification region with a developing polar low; and in the second the improvement is associated with an upper-level trough. The impact of cycling targeted data in the background of the forecast (including the memory of previous targeted observations) is investigated. This is shown to cause a greater forecast impact, but does not necessarily lead to a greater forecast improvement.

Journal of Plankton Research 17, 1245–1271]). The two models include similar ranges of PO14CP and community structure, but differ in the relative influence of allochthonous organic matter in the oligotrophic provinces. Both models were used to predict NCP from PO14CP measurements obtained during 11 local and three seasonal studies in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, and from satellite-derived estimates of PO14CP. Comparison of these NCP predictions with concurrent in situ measurements and geochemical estimates of NCP showed that geographic and annual patterns of NCP can only be predicted when the relative trophic importance of local vs. distant processes is similar in both modeled and predicted ecosystems. The system-dependent ability of our models to predict NCP seasonality suggests that trophic-level dynamics are stronger than differences in hydrodynamic regime, taxonomic composition and phytoplankton growth. The regional differences in the predictive power of both models confirm the existence of biogeographic differences in the scale of trophic dynamics, which impede the use of a single generalized equation to estimate global marine plankton NCP.\r\n\r\nThis paper shows the potential of a systematic empirical approach to predict plankton NCP from local and satellite-derived P estimates.","bibo:AuthorList":["Serret, P","Robinson, C","Fernandez, E","Tiera, E","Tilstone, G","Perez, V"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2771177,"sim:weight":0.512376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772696,"sim:weight":0.448801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761077,"sim:weight":0.44775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768779,"sim:weight":0.423649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":821416,"sim:weight":0.421868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31149,"sim:weight":0.397884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24791,"sim:weight":0.389194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768922,"sim:weight":0.381995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771289,"sim:weight":0.379836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26714,"sim:weight":0.373528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29435,"sim:weight":0.369647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23541,"sim:weight":0.359237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9537704,"sim:weight":0.335243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767706,"sim:weight":0.334721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5217150,"sim:weight":0.332414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.331933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.326223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.323144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29470,"sim:weight":0.318154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27380,"sim:weight":0.317523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The article first maps the two areas of scholarship, discussing the cognitive, social marketing and social provisioning systems literatures of SC and the empirical and conceptual literature on EJ. The article then discusses the potential for cross-fertilisation between the two areas of scholarship. It indicates how SC scholarship can benefit from the social justice sensitivity of the EJ scholarship and how the latter area of scholarship can gain a whole new area of empirical research focusing on social justice aspects of consumption. The article seeks to demonstrate the social and policy significance of the cross-fertilisation by comparing the consumption and EJ implications of carbon taxation and personal carbon allowance trading as tools of carbon management. The article suggests that to be fair both strategies of carbon management require complementary (albeit different) measures that address background inequalities and capabilities to act in the setting created by the instruments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Seyfang, G","Paavola, J"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.525735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.513337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.480146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.479171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.479077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.465224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The dynamics of postconvective vortices are key to understanding the role of convection in ocean circulation. Submesoscale coherent vortices (SCVs) observed in convective regions are likely to be the anticyclonic components of hetons. Hetons are dipoles, consisting of a surface cyclone and a weakly stratified subsurface anticyclone, that can be formed by convection. Here, key postconvective processes are investigated using numerical experiments of increasing sophistication with two primary goals: 1) to understand how the ambient hydrography and topography influence the propagation of hetons and 2) to provide a theoretical context for recent observations of SCVs in the Greenland Sea. It is found that the alignment of hetons is controlled by ambient horizontal density gradients and that hetons self-propagate into lighter waters as a result. This provides a mechanism for transporting convected water out of a cyclonic gyre, but the propagation is arrested if the heton meets large-amplitude topography. Upon interaction with topography, hetons usually separate, and the surface cyclone returns toward denser water. The anticyclone usually remains close to topography and may become trapped for several hundred days. These findings may explain the observed accumulation and longevity of SCVs at the Greenland Fracture Zone, on the rim of the Greenland Sea gyre. The separation and sorting of cyclones from anticyclones have likely implications for the density and vorticity budgets of convective regions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Oliver, KIC","Eldevik, T","Stevens, DP","Watson, AJ"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.346872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6206111,"sim:weight":0.289972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761092,"sim:weight":0.263293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766142,"sim:weight":0.259338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A single application of EMD to a time series essentially acts as a local high-pass filter. Hence, successive applications can be used to produce a bandpass filter that is highly efficient at extracting a broadband signal such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The basic EMD method is adapted to minimize end effects, such that it is suitable for use in real time. The EMD process is then used to efficiently extract the MJO signal from gridded time series of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data.\r\n\r\nA range of statistical models from the general class of vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models was then tested for their suitability in forecasting the MJO signal, as isolated by the EMD.

Forecasts were then made on the remaining independent data from 1998 to 2004. These were made in real time, as only data up to the date the forecast was made were used.

One reason for this\r\nis the difficulty of ensuring that translated measures preserve conceptual, item,\r\nsemantic, operational, measurement; and functional equivalence (Herdman et al\r\n[?]:331), which is illustrated by an account of the translation, pre-piloting, and\r\nadministration of a new individualised QoL measure, the Global Person Generated\r\nIndex or ‘GPGI’. The GPGI is based on the widely used Patient Generated Index\r\n(Ruta et al [31]) and offers many of the advantages of the participatory approaches\r\ncommonly used in developing countries, with added methodological rigour, and\r\nquantitative outcomes. It was successfully validated in Bangladesh, Thailand, and\r\nEthiopia, using quantitative and qualitative methods - open-ended, semi-structured\r\ninterviews (SSIs), conducted immediately post-administration. Both the measure and\r\nmethod of ‘qualitative validation’ described later in the paper offer an exciting\r\nalternative for future researchers and practitioners in this field.

There were strong correlation between\r\nscores from the GPGI and SSIs for the area of health, and moderate correlations for\r\n‘material wellbeing\u0027 (MWB)i and children. Weak to moderate correlations were\r\nobserved between the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the GPGI; however, the\r\nhighest coefficient was between the GPGI and the most conceptually similar item.\r\nStatistically significant differences were seen in GPGI scores between rich and poor,\r\nurban and rural respondents, and different countries. Health and material wellbeing\r\nscores, derived from the SSIs, also showed a linear relationship with GPGI scores,\r\nwith a suggestion of curvilinearity at the higher levels, as predicted by a general QoL\r\ncausal model.

Yet it is often criticized as a Western concept celebrating\r\nindividualism and independence over group obligations and interdependence\r\nor dependence. This paper rejects this view and argues that coherent\r\naccounts of autonomy must always recognize the interdependence of people in\r\ngroups, and that autonomy can coexist with substantial relationships of\r\ndependence. It illustrates this drawing on evidence from Bangladesh, a poor\r\ncountry usually absent from cross-cultural studies and one where personal\r\nrelationships of hierarchy and dependence are endemic. Argument and evidence\r\nare presented showing the coexistence of personal autonomy and\r\ndependence, and the relationship between collective action and autonomy. We\r\nalso address some of the specific problems encountered in researching autonomy\r\nin a social context where it is mainly expressed in relational forms. We\r\nconclude that autonomy can be directed toward both personal and social goals,\r\nand can be enacted individually, or by participation in groups. Autonomy is a\r\nuniversal psychological need but its expression is always contextual.","bibo:AuthorList":["Devine, Joe","Camfield, Laura","Gough, Ian"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":89116,"sim:weight":0.337811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Mixing processes in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current are key to this circulation, because they control the rate at which water sinking at high latitudes returns to the surface in the Southern Ocean. Yet estimates of the rates of these processes and of the upwelling that they induce are poorly constrained by observations. Here we take advantage of a natural tracer-release experiment - an injection of mantle helium from hydrothermal vents into the Circumpolar Current near Drake Passage - to measure the rates of mixing and upwelling in the current\u0027s intermediate layers over a sector that spans nearly one-tenth of its circumpolar path. Dispersion of the tracer reveals rapid upwelling along density surfaces and intense mixing across density surfaces, both occurring at rates that are an order of magnitude greater than rates implicit in models of the average Southern Ocean overturning. These findings support the view that deep-water pathways along and across density surfaces intensify and intertwine as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows over complex ocean-floor topography, giving rise to a short circuit of the overturning circulation in these regions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Naveira Garabato, AC","Stevens, DP","Watson, AJ","Roether, W"],"dc:date":"2007-05-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766142,"sim:weight":0.633736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001917,"sim:weight":0.578741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495342,"sim:weight":0.511398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27273,"sim:weight":0.504636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24808,"sim:weight":0.47804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31146,"sim:weight":0.47682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269883,"sim:weight":0.475665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.43883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766157,"sim:weight":0.434506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30695,"sim:weight":0.428212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":962407,"sim:weight":0.420115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":864661,"sim:weight":0.415352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000100,"sim:weight":0.391219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":481859,"sim:weight":0.38515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30700,"sim:weight":0.375936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28620,"sim:weight":0.373893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28135,"sim:weight":0.365038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271218,"sim:weight":0.358599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29454,"sim:weight":0.354086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31869,"sim:weight":0.353437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thus consumers now have a choice of outlets for local and organic produce. This paper examines the implications of that choice for direct marketing in particular, and sustainable consumption in general. The paper tests the hypothesis that consumers make a conscious choice to engage in an alternative food network when they purchase through direct marketing channels, and that they are deliberately avoiding mainstream supermarkets. Research findings are presented from a survey of customers of a local organic food cooperative in Norfolk, UK which examines consumer motivations and perceptions of alternative and mainstream food provisioning. The hypothesis is confirmed: consumers expressed wide-ranging preferences for participation in the alternative food system, though there is some concern that the convenience and accessibility of supermarket provision of local and organic food threaten to erode the wider social and community benefits achieved by direct marketing initiatives.","bibo:AuthorList":["Seyfang, G"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176853,"sim:weight":0.674803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109110,"sim:weight":0.483657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46812,"sim:weight":0.46953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447739,"sim:weight":0.467241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146142,"sim:weight":0.453539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.409624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.409624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.387273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.376065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.375948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26013,"sim:weight":0.370451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26012,"sim:weight":0.370451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.360686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.360009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.350525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.350525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.350525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.350525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.350525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.350525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Lens epithelial cells contain a range of G-protein–coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases that induce increases in intracellular Ca2+. Receptor-associated Ca2+ influx is, therefore, likely to be an important route for Ca2+ influx to the lens. The authors investigated stimulated and passive Ca2+ influx in in situ human lens epithelium.\r\nCa2+ changes in equatorial (E) and central anterior (CA) epithelial cells were monitored with the use of a Ca2+ indicator (Fluo4) and confocal microscopy. Gene expression was monitored by RT-PCR and immunoblotting.\r\nAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) induced Ca2+ responses that were smaller in CA than E. Ca2+ store depletion, using ATP (100 μM) or thapsigargin (1 μM), revealed greater relative store capacity and Ca2+ influx in E. Ca2+ influx was blocked by La3+ (0.5 μM) in both regions. Unstimulated Ca2+ influx was greater in E than CA. Greater expression of Orai1 and STIM1 was detected in E than in CA.\r\nGreater Ca2+ store capacity and Ca2+ influx in E compared with CA reflects underlying differences in proliferation and differentiation between the regions. The relatively small resting Ca2+ influx in CA epithelium suggests that store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is the main route of Ca2+ influx in these cells. Greater resting influx and SOCE in E cells suggests that these are a major route for Ca2+ influx into the lens. Increased expression of Orai1 and STIM1 in E could account for the differences in Ca2+ entry. Receptor activation will modulate Ca2+ influx, and inappropriate activity may contribute to cortical cataract.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rhodes, JD","Russell, SL","Illingworth, CD","Duncan, G","Wormstone, IM"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A detailed discussion of the assignment of the amide I band is given. At 0% hydration no changes in the secondary structure with temperature could be detected; spectra were consistent with a tight disordered structure with many protein−protein interactions. At 13% hydration, distinctive changes occurred in the low-frequency region of the amide I band (1630−1613 cm-1). This was attributed to changes in the β-sheet structure. On cooling to 25 °C, these changes were mainly reversed. It was noted that most of the changes observed occurred above the glass transition temperature. At 47% hydration, more complex changes took place: as the temperature was raised distinct bands at 1630 and 1613 cm-1 merged. However, this process was partially reversed, with recovery of both bands, on cooling. The significance of these results in relation to other changes in gluten proteins in flour and dough with temperature and water content is discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Georget, Dominique M.

Nevertheless, ithas been recognised as a device that may soon change the mode of operationsthroughout the supply chain. There is no question that the technology willreduce labour and improve accuracy in inventory management by improvinginventory visibility. However, a review of recent research and the developmentof RFID technology in supply chain related applications indicated thatdeployment of the technology are restricted to the mandates of some giantplayers in the industries. It is still unclear that how return on investment ofRFID-based projects could be justified. This paper aims to present a review ofthe technology and some recent development of RFID in relation to supplychain applications. Future research direction is then suggested.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chan, Hing Kai","Chan , Felix T.S."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":866354,"sim:weight":0.632127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5083888,"sim:weight":0.631002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":717314,"sim:weight":0.61305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105185,"sim:weight":0.56895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5066503,"sim:weight":0.552581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":896350,"sim:weight":0.5121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":799316,"sim:weight":0.503052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":800155,"sim:weight":0.491337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":821879,"sim:weight":0.487158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338541,"sim:weight":0.480988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":793204,"sim:weight":0.430505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":767290,"sim:weight":0.329836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.272259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.266804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.219029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.217034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.217034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.217034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.217034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.217034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An extension to ArcGIS was created to allow the positional accuracy of address locations to be represented sonically using piano notes. This was evaluated by 49 spatial data users during a computerbased evaluation and subsequent discussion sessions. Two factors that had a significant impact on successful interpretation were the proportion of the attribute under investigation in the data and the presentation method.  Knowledge of the data source also appeared important. Future studies will broaden the applications to include climate scenario data and virtual reality visualisations of future landscapes, as well as different aspects of sound.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bearman, N","Lovett, A"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108579,"sim:weight":0.41442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.375925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.367489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.367052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.357151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.356858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4896009,"sim:weight":0.349767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.348302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.341222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.339775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.33962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186608,"sim:weight":0.330776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.330276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656507,"sim:weight":0.330233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.328497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.325006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.325006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.325006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.325006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.325006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These can often be traced back to an erroneous simulation of the diurnal cycle, and can lead to errors in global climate, through planetary wave propagation. Here, we examine the simulation of the diurnal cycle over the Maritime Continent in a series of high-resolution integrations of the UK Met Office atmospheric model, with horizontal resolutions of 40 and 12 km (where the convection is parametrised) and 4 km (where the convection is explicitly resolved), as part of the Cascade project. In these models, the vertical heating profile over the islands changes from a convective profile with a mid-tropospheric maximum in the early afternoon to a more stratiform profile with upper-tropospheric heating and mid-tropospheric cooling later. The convective heating profile forces a first internal mode gravity wave that propagates rapidly offshore; the deep warm anomalies behind its downwelling wavefront suppress convection offshore during early afternoon. The stratiform heating profile forces a gravity wave with a higher-order vertical mode that propagates slowly offshore later in the afternoon. This mode has a negative, destabilising temperature anomaly in the mid-troposphere. Together with the convergence zone between the wave fronts of the two modes, favourable conditions are created for offshore convection. In the 4 km explicit convection model, the offshore convection responds strongly to this gravity wave forcing, in agreement with observations, supporting a gravity wave–convection paradigm for the diurnal cycle over the Maritime Continent. However, the convective response in the lower-resolution models is much less coherent, leading to errors in the diurnal cycle and mean precipitation. Hence, to improve climate model simulations, sensitivity to gravity wave forcing should be a factor in future convective parametrisation schemes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Love, BS","Matthews, AJ","Lister, GMS"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":31910,"sim:weight":0.455928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27946,"sim:weight":0.424303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27356,"sim:weight":0.417797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1098228,"sim:weight":0.411074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31900,"sim:weight":0.393778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766152,"sim:weight":0.386006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27259,"sim:weight":0.368269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32133,"sim:weight":0.36672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27536,"sim:weight":0.35333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24627,"sim:weight":0.343257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.341674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28620,"sim:weight":0.34021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.33966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31959,"sim:weight":0.335707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.332445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.331085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2674698,"sim:weight":0.330373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68722,"sim:weight":0.326961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.325783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43343,"sim:weight":0.325066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The steady state surface temperature of the dome depends on both magmatic gas mass flux and rainfall rate. A critical rainfall rate is determined, that cools the dome surface to 100°C. Rainfall rates above this critical value allow liquid infiltration into the void spaces of the dome, thus restricting the escape of magmatic gas. A model which restricts the gas flow through the surface predicts internal gas pressures much higher than the overburden pressure in the top few meters, approximately one hour after the onset of rainfall. For a marginally stable dome, this could cause small Vulcanian explosions, which (depending on their location) could trigger a dome collapse, on a timescale consistent with observations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hicks, PD","Matthews, AJ","Cooker, MJ"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2768432,"sim:weight":0.828121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771099,"sim:weight":0.456445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.296768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27356,"sim:weight":0.293503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890336,"sim:weight":0.277539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97223,"sim:weight":0.269011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.262455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821063,"sim:weight":0.252875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880954,"sim:weight":0.252038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108243,"sim:weight":0.250649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17994,"sim:weight":0.226642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108347,"sim:weight":0.221995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.219925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61637,"sim:weight":0.218555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890284,"sim:weight":0.215408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.207402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.207384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890825,"sim:weight":0.20323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.194979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.193328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Whilst the film is usually discussed as a woman’s film, on release it was centred as part of a distinct shift in the horror genre from ‘grade B thrillers to deluxe chillers’.\r\nThe reclassification of films like The Spiral Staircase as woman’s films could be seen as an attempt to make text fit established theory – the film is addressed to a female audience and thus cannot be a horror film. Through an\r\nanalysis of textual and extra-textual discourses, including reception and publicity materials, this paper will challenge the pervasive theories that suggest female pleasure or identification is unattainable in horror spectatorship. Whilst the theory is that women refuse to look at horror, averting their eyes or turning away, in 1946 The Spiral Staircase asked a predominantly female audience to take a closer look and question the very act of looking at the cinema screen.","bibo:AuthorList":["Snelson, Tim"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382086,"sim:weight":0.594404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.559906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98480,"sim:weight":0.541726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99315,"sim:weight":0.53526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.527653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383487,"sim:weight":0.524056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352166,"sim:weight":0.505224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710671,"sim:weight":0.502593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710177,"sim:weight":0.502281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46714,"sim:weight":0.495354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.493284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44738,"sim:weight":0.481242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44743,"sim:weight":0.478037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48343,"sim:weight":0.476542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.474486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43485,"sim:weight":0.464867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46776,"sim:weight":0.45506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108197,"sim:weight":0.45069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46502,"sim:weight":0.435285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381940,"sim:weight":0.43041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2773039,"ep:Repository":124,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The mechanisms of calcium homeostasis and signalling in the lens","bibo:abstract":"Excessive Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e can be detrimental to cells and raised levels of Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e in human lenses with cortical cataract have been found to play a major role in the opacification process. Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e homeostasis is therefore, recognised as having fundamental importance in lens pathophysiology. Furthermore, Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e plays a central role as a second messenger in cell signalling and mechanisms have evolved which give cells exquisite control over intracellular Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e ([Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e]\u003csub\u003ei\u003c/sub\u003e) via an array of specialised regulatory and signalling proteins. In this review we discuss these mechanisms as they apply to the lens. Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e levels in human aqueous humour are approximately 1\u0026nbsp;mM and there is a large, 10,000 fold, inwardly directed gradient across the plasma membrane. In the face of such a large gradient highly efficient mechanisms are needed to maintain low [Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e]\u003csub\u003ei\u003c/sub\u003e. The Na\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e/Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e exchanger (NCX) and plasma membrane Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e-ATPase (PMCA) actively remove Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e from the cells, whereas the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e-ATPase (SERCA) sequesters Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e store. In lens epithelial cells the dominant role is played by the ATPases, whilst in the fibre cells NCX activity appears to be more important. Usually, [Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e]\u003csub\u003ei\u003c/sub\u003e can be increased in a number of ways. Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e influx through the plasma membrane, for example, is mediated by an array of channels with evidence in the lens for the presence of voltage-operated Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e channels (VOCCs), receptor-operated Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e channels (ROCCs) and channels mediating store-operated Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e entry (SOCE). Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e signalling is initiated via activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) of which the lens expresses a surprisingly diverse array responding to various neurotransmitters, hormones, growth factors, autocoids and proteases.

Acoustic free-stream disturbances are considered. Asymptotic results based on large Reynolds number ($U^2 / \\omega \\nu \\,{\\gg}\\, 1$) are presented, supplemented by numerical solutions. The influence of mean aerodynamic loading enters the theory through a parameter $\\mu$, which provides a measure of the flow speed variations in the leading-edge region, due to flow around the leading edge from the lower surface to the upper. A Strouhal number based on airfoil nose radius, $S\\,{\u003d}\\,\\omega r_n/U$, also enters the theory. The variation of the receptivity level as a function of $\\mu $ and $S$ is analysed. Modest levels of aerodynamic loading are found to decrease the receptivity level for the upper surface of the airfoil, while the receptivity is increased for the lower surface. For larger angles of attack close to the critical angle for boundary layer separation, a local rise in the receptivity occurs for the upper surface, while on the lower surface the receptivity decreases. These effects are more pronounced at larger values of $S$. While the Tollmien–Schlichting wave does not emerge until a downstream distance of $O((U^2 / \\omega \\nu)^{1/3} U / \\omega)$, the amplitude of the Tollmien–Schlichting wave is influenced by the acoustic free-stream disturbances only in a relatively small region near the leading edge, of length approximately $4 U/\\omega$.

The initial signal is taken to be an isolated N-wave, which is the disturbance that is generated some distance away from a supersonic body in horizontal flight. The effect of cylindrical spreading and exponential density stratification on the propagation of the disturbance is considered, with the shock structure controlled by molecular relaxation mechanisms and by thermoviscous diffusion. An augmented Burgers equation is obtained and asymptotic solutions are derived based on the limit of small dissipation and dispersion. For a single relaxation mode, the solution depends on whether relaxation alone can support the shock or whether a sub-shock arises controlled by other mechanisms. The resulting shock structures are known as fully dispersed and partly dispersed shocks, respectively. In this paper, the spatial location of the transition between fully dispersed and partly dispersed shocks is identified for shocks propagating above and below the horizontal. This phenomenon is important in understanding the character of sonic booms since the transition to a partly dispersed shock structure leads to the appearance of a shorter scale in the shock rise-time, associated with the embedded sub-shock.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hammerton, PW"],"dc:date":"2001-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1568171,"sim:weight":0.420288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268054,"sim:weight":0.334853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.331852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98585,"sim:weight":0.317833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63162,"sim:weight":0.313229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764134,"sim:weight":0.313018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29436,"sim:weight":0.312794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8335,"sim:weight":0.312172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.300345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890329,"sim:weight":0.299354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.297733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96511,"sim:weight":0.285538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1568205,"sim:weight":0.282775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.280005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96505,"sim:weight":0.275873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96501,"sim:weight":0.272747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186392,"sim:weight":0.269832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43507,"sim:weight":0.268379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271192,"sim:weight":0.267584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4872629,"sim:weight":0.26365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The radius of curvature of the leading edge, rn, enters the theory through a Strouhal number, S\u003dωrn/U, where ω is the frequency of the unsteady free-stream disturbance and U is the mean flow speed. Numerical results revealed that the variation of receptivity for small S was very different for free-stream acoustic waves propagating parallel to the mean flow and those free-stream waves propagating at an angle to the mean flow. In this paper the small-S asymptotic theory is presented. For free-stream acoustic waves propagating parallel to the symmetric mean flow, the receptivity is found to vary linearly with S, giving a small increase in the amplitude of the receptivity coefficient for small S compared to the flat-plate value. In contrast, for oblique free-stream acoustic waves, the receptivity varies with S1/2, leading to a sharp decrease in the amplitude of the receptivity coefficient relative to the flat-plate value.

The targeted observations were made in the lee of Greenland; the dependence of the impact on the proximity of the observations to the Greenland coast is also investigated. Experiments were conducted using the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM), over a limited-area domain at 24-km grid spacing, with a four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) scheme. Reducing the operational dropsonde observation errors by one-half increases the maximum forecast improvement from 5% to 7%–10%, measured in terms of total energy. However, the largest impact is seen by replacing two dropsondes on the Greenland coast with two farther from the steep orography; this increases the maximum forecast improvement from 5% to 18% for an 18-h forecast (using operational observation errors). Forecast degradation caused by two dropsonde observations on the Greenland coast is shown to arise from spreading of data by the background errors up the steep slope of Greenland. Removing boundary layer data from these dropsondes reduces the forecast degradation, but it is only a partial solution to this problem. Although only from one case study, these results suggest that observations positioned within a correlation length scale of steep orography may degrade the forecast through the anomalous upslope spreading of analysis increments along terrain-following model levels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Irvine, EA","Gray, SL","Methven, J","Renfrew, IA"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2771299,"sim:weight":0.699926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":666487,"sim:weight":0.555317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771434,"sim:weight":0.513014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43343,"sim:weight":0.337278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31933,"sim:weight":0.32772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.313779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.309393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4896009,"sim:weight":0.309372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001236,"sim:weight":0.308539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771058,"sim:weight":0.305042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.29708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.294989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.294363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.294362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32061,"sim:weight":0.29362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186392,"sim:weight":0.284928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772411,"sim:weight":0.283487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.277913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1141054,"sim:weight":0.274501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.271712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The time period of the study is September–December 2002, although results are shown to be representative of the long-term climatology. Characteristics of the storms were documented as they progressed across the North Pacific, including their path, central pressure, deepening rate, and speed of translation. Clear patterns emerged. Storms tended to deepen in two distinct geographical locations—the Gulf of Alaska in early fall and the western North Pacific in late fall. In the Gulf of Alaska, a quasi-permanent “notch” in the SST distribution is argued to be of significance. The signature of the notch is imprinted in the atmosphere, resulting in a region of enhanced cyclonic potential vorticity in the lower troposphere that is conducive for storm development. Later in the season, as winter approaches and the Sea of Okhotsk becomes partially ice covered and cold, the air emanating from the Asian continent leads to enhanced baroclinicity in the region south of Kamchatka. This corresponds to enhanced storm cyclogenesis in that region. Consequently, there is a seasonal westward migration of the dominant lobe of the Aleutian low. The impact of the wind stress curl pattern resulting from these two regions of storm development on the oceanic circulation is investigated using historical hydrography. It is argued that the seasonal bimodal input of cyclonic vorticity from the wind may be partly responsible for the two distinct North Pacific subarctic gyres.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pickart, RS","Moore, GWK","MacDonald, AM","Renfrew, IA","Walsh, JE","Kessler, WS"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2766152,"sim:weight":0.489743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30697,"sim:weight":0.479329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772145,"sim:weight":0.451867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29454,"sim:weight":0.45005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28843,"sim:weight":0.446508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30700,"sim:weight":0.441805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.441213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31926,"sim:weight":0.441184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31931,"sim:weight":0.436799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31927,"sim:weight":0.433314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269886,"sim:weight":0.429801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.423348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31929,"sim:weight":0.421987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31928,"sim:weight":0.420837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.419038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.414515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31933,"sim:weight":0.412961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772411,"sim:weight":0.412296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.407653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29494,"sim:weight":0.407426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An Attempt of Analytical ‘Unbundling’ of Competition from Consumer Welfare","bibo:abstract":"This paper is an attempt to evaluate the conceptual relationship between two central elements of the theory of antitrust: competition and consumer welfare. These two notions are analysed in their mutual dependency. The main purpose of this paper is to show that both competition and consumer welfare are economic values of fundamental importance with no ex ante hierarchical dominance of consumer welfare over competition. In case of conflict, priority might be given to either of these values depending on the context of the assessment. As can be understood from the very etymology of the term, competition is a notion which encompasses a process, more than a result. The notion of consumer welfare, on the other hand, is result-oriented. If we are interested in the outcomes that can be generated by competition only, then the very process of rivalry between undertakings would be seen as unnecessary or, at least, not indispensable. If, however, we consider that competition (seen as a process) is important for the societal paradigm of economic development, then the outcomes generated by this process are not the only reason for the rivalry between undertakings to exist. Methodologically, the latter approach appears to be more consistent with the idea of liberal democracy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andriychuk, Oles"],"dc:date":"2009-12-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":2773549,"ep:Repository":124,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Rediscovering the Spirit of Competition: On the Normative Value of the Competitive Process","bibo:abstract":"The paper develops its core argument in 12 sections structured in three parts: I Positive analysis; II Normative proposal; and III Operationalisation. Section B illustrates the traditional justification for the utilitarian perception of competition and analyses its main weaknesses. Section C explores conceptual differences and underlines the fundamental similarities of the two major deontological antitrust schools (Austrian and Ordoliberal). Section D provides some conceptual argumentation for the treatment of competition as a constitutional value. Section E introduces the theoretical framework of value pluralism which reconciles the conflicts between constitutional values. The methodology of value pluralism is applied in order to balance the value of competition with the interests of welfare. Section F opens the second part of the paper. It explores competition as the essence of liberal democracy, claiming that the economic aspects of competition together with its political (elections) and cultural (free speech) elements constitute the core of democratic governance. Accordingly, these values should be protected as a matter of evolutionary choice of society without any utility-based verification. Section G conceptualises the ‘Oroboros dilemma’ of self-destructive freedom and democracy, which is described in the domain of competition by Robert Bork as the ‘antitrust paradox: a policy at war with itself ’. Section H continues the comparative analysis of competition. It explores regulatory practices developed for the protection of free elections (political competition) and free speech (cultural competition) on one hand and economic competition on the other. It reveals the main methodological error of antitrust, which prevents immunisation of some anticompetitive practices from sanctions on non-utilitarian grounds. This section concludes that, unlike its political and cultural counterparts, economic competition is gradually transforming into a purely instrumental consequentialist policy which corresponds neither to the semantics nor even to the syntax of the term ‘competition’. The logic of such transformation is a direct consequence of the above-mentioned methodological inconsistency between economic competition on one hand and the political and cultural aspects of competition on the other. Section I develops the argument that in certain situations anticompetitive agreements are immunised from antitrust sanctions provided that they simultaneously promote competition more than they distort it. This possibility exists in the regulation of the political and cultural aspects of competition, but it is missing in the economic context. The current structure of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) does not envisage this option. Therefore in practice courts tend to develop indirect ways of granting immunity to undertakings which cannot conform to the rigid utilitarian requirements of Article 101(3) TFEU. While acceptable, this solution is far from optimal. For this reason the section proposes a conceptual amendment of Article 101 TFEU. This proposal is designed as a contribution to the academic debate on the role of the competitive process in antitrust rather than as a direct call for changes in primary European law. Section J clarifies that the proposed deontological benchmark for competition does not diminish the importance of utilitarian values since the proposal merely extends the current regulatory framework without substituting any of its existing parts. The application of the amended Article 101 (3) TFEU would still be based upon the discretion of the decision-maker. The will of the decision-maker (be it the Commission, national authorities or courts) constitutes the central part of this section. It analyses the balancing techniques, developed by the legal and constitutional theories and implements them into the area of antitrust. Section K continues the analysis of the balancing act, dealing specifically with the technique of separation of different values. It proposes a two-step methodology of balancing. The first one is purely value-centric. It artificially isolates each value from all others in order to undertake their independent analysis which helps to understand the internal essence of each value separately. The second consecutive step recontextualises previously isolated values into the main regulatory agenda. This section demonstrates that the present-day regulatory status of competition does not enable it to be in the par-in-parem relationships with other values, because all balancing acts are performed as a one-step analysis: each value is only balanced against the others at the external level, where the one with the higher importance always prevails. This section is designed to provide the operational justification for the normative proposal developed in Section I. The last section summarises the main findings of the paper.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andriychuk, Oles"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9616993,"sim:weight":0.840855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is misleading to define competition by evaluating its external role on the economy. This role is important only from the perspective of performance. From the ontological view however it is irrelevant. Some forms of competition are good or beneficial others are considered as harmful or undesirable, but in both cases we talk about different features of the same phenomenon. The idea that ‘competition has to bring positive outcomes for economy, otherwise it is not competition’ is logically incorrect. It is impossible to qualify the essence of object only by exploring its external effects. The paper concludes that competition itself deserves its protection even in circumstances when it does not lead to efficiency gains. In this respect competition can be seen as a ‘luxury product’ of market-oriented societies, which is not indispensable for achieving such values as industrial growth, market integration, social coherency, consumer welfare or innovations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andriychuk, Oles"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A broader range of geochemically distinctive types occurs amongst the 2007 enclaves. Crystal-poor enclaves generally have the least evolved (basaltic) compositions; porphyritic enclaves represent compositions intermediate between basaltic and andesitic compositions.

One hypothesis suggests that bacteria from the genus Pseudonocardia are the sole, co-evolved mutualists of attine ants and are transmitted vertically by the queens. A recent study identified a Pseudonocardia-produced antifungal, named dentigerumycin, associated with the lower attine Apterostigma dentigerum consistent with the idea that co-evolved Pseudonocardia make novel antibiotics. An alternative possibility is that attine ants sample actinomycete bacteria from the soil, selecting and maintaining those species that make useful antibiotics. Consistent with this idea, a Streptomyces species associated with the higher attine Acromyrmex octospinosus was recently shown to produce the well-known antifungal candicidin. Candicidin production is widespread in environmental isolates of Streptomyces, so this could either be an environmental contaminant or evidence of recruitment of useful actinomycetes from the environment. It should be noted that the two possibilities for actinomycete acquisition are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: In order to test these possibilities we isolated bacteria from a geographically distinct population of A. octospinosus and identified a candicidin-producing Streptomyces species, which suggests that they are common mutualists of attine ants, most probably recruited from the environment. We also identified a Pseudonocardia species in the same ant colony that produces an unusual polyene antifungal, providing evidence for co-evolution of Pseudonocardia with A. octospinosus.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a combination of co-evolution and environmental sampling results in the diversity of actinomycete symbionts and antibiotics associated with attine ants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barke, J","Seipke, R","Grüschow, S","Heavens, D","Drou, N","Bibb, MJ","Goss, RJM","Yu, D","Hutchings, M"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2768022,"sim:weight":0.321604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772412,"sim:weight":0.295438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.295436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45241,"sim:weight":0.258508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77058,"sim:weight":0.256059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18949,"sim:weight":0.246308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2835560,"sim:weight":0.246308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.241466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45631,"sim:weight":0.227738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767998,"sim:weight":0.222785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.217992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769016,"sim:weight":0.21615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.212339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46554,"sim:weight":0.210823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.210724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.205872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771232,"sim:weight":0.205705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643950,"sim:weight":0.195168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.192795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75329,"sim:weight":0.184851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The signal peptide is cleaved by lipoprotein signal peptidase (Lsp) to leave the lipid-modified cysteine at the N-terminus of the mature lipoprotein. In all Gram-positive bacteria tested to date this pathway is non-essential and the lipid attaches the protein to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. Here we identify lipoproteins in the model Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor using bioinformatics coupled with proteomic and downstream analysis. We report that Streptomyces species translocate large numbers of lipoproteins out via the Tat (twin arginine translocase) pathway and we present evidence that lipoprotein biogenesis might be an essential pathway in S. coelicolor. This is the first analysis of lipoproteins and lipoprotein biogenesis in Streptomyces and provides the first evidence that lipoprotein biogenesis could be essential in a Gram-positive bacterium. This report also provides the first experimental evidence that Tat plays a major role in the translocation of lipoproteins in a specific bacterium.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thompson, BJ","Widdick, DA","Hicks, MG","Chandra, G","Sutcliffe, IC","Palmer, T","Hutchings, MI"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2767998,"sim:weight":0.697909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773718,"sim:weight":0.691111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2756271,"sim:weight":0.466616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773716,"sim:weight":0.414298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2756695,"sim:weight":0.404431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45631,"sim:weight":0.393159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101465,"sim:weight":0.38051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768022,"sim:weight":0.378264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.371307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772412,"sim:weight":0.346345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755752,"sim:weight":0.345769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45241,"sim:weight":0.309725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44537,"sim:weight":0.299611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.282938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47544,"sim:weight":0.279051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.25766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.256032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76172,"sim:weight":0.252689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75329,"sim:weight":0.244933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46869,"sim:weight":0.241122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Analysis of the S. scabies genome sequence indicates that it is likely to secrete many proteins via the twin arginine protein transport (Tat) pathway, including several proteins whose coding sequences may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer and share a common ancestor with proteins in other plant pathogens. Inactivation of the S. scabies Tat pathway resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes including slower growth rate and increased permeability of the cell envelope. Comparison of the extracellular proteome of the wild type and DeltatatC strains identified 73 predicted secretory proteins that were present in reduced amounts in the tatC mutant strain, and 47 Tat substrates were verified using a Tat reporter assay. The DeltatatC strain was almost completely avirulent on Arabidopsis seedlings and was delayed in attaching to the root tip relative to the wild-type strain. Genes encoding 14 candidate Tat substrates were individually inactivated, and seven of these mutants were reduced in virulence compared with the wild-type strain. We conclude that the Tat pathway secretes multiple proteins that are required for full virulence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Joshi, MV","Mann, SG","Antelmann, H","Widdick, DA","Fyans, JK","Chandra, G","Hutchings, MI","Toth, I","Hecker, M","Loria, R","Palmer, T"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2773714,"sim:weight":0.414298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":124402,"sim:weight":0.158646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In taking diplomatic initiatives forward, leaders are compelled to respond to the needs of domestic constituencies, through granting concessions and building coalitions, while international negotiations are pursued with one goal in mind: that any agreement will not damage the domestic political calculus. This article contends that Lyndon Johnson\u0027s actions in 1968 disprove this thesis. The President was in fact relaxed about a Richard Nixon victory in the general election as his commitment to defend South Vietnam from communism was stronger than that of his sitting Vice President, Hubert Humphrey.

It has been proposed that NO directly modulates NsrR activity by interacting with a predicted [Fe-S] cluster in the NsrR protein, but no experimental evidence has been published to support this hypothesis. Here we report the purification of NsrR from the obligate aerobe Streptomyces coelicolor. We demonstrate using UV-visible, near UV CD and EPR spectroscopy that the protein contains an NO-sensitive [2Fe-2S] cluster when purified from E. coli. Upon exposure of NsrR to NO, the cluster is nitrosylated, which results in the loss of DNA binding activity as detected by bandshift assays. Removal of the [2Fe-2S] cluster to generate apo-NsrR also resulted in loss of DNA binding activity. This is the first demonstration that NsrR contains an NO-sensitive [2Fe-2S] cluster that is required for DNA binding activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tucker, NP","Hicks, M","Clarke, T","Avondo, J","Chandra, G","Le Brun, N","Dixon, R","Hutchings, M"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1585842,"sim:weight":0.428667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585857,"sim:weight":0.413513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.40949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26064,"sim:weight":0.406407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45241,"sim:weight":0.404257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.401887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768022,"sim:weight":0.386252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.385912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77076,"sim:weight":0.384115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780475,"sim:weight":0.374852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.372798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.369572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761091,"sim:weight":0.368766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772412,"sim:weight":0.363929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.363059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.360927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.35502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44537,"sim:weight":0.352378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222850,"sim:weight":0.349983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769012,"sim:weight":0.335934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Applying dyadic regression techniques and controlling for individual socio-economic characteristics, we obtain insights into the determinants of the size and density as well as the socio-economic heterogeneity of individual networks. Assuming these network characteristics correlate with one‟s agency and benefits from network participation, we look for differences between men‟s and women‟s networks and its relation with gender. In general, the gendered private/public dichotomy and labor division is replicated in men‟s and women‟s networks. Furthermore, consistent with the restricted mobility of poor rural women, we observe that geographic distance limits the networks of women but not men. Next, female education and mobility, and newly-residing men, have a positive influence on the integration between men and women. Finally, clique formation is stronger around women than men.","bibo:AuthorList":["D\u0027Exelle, Ben","Holvoet, Nathalie"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A Field Experiment with Irrigators in Semi-arid Africa","bibo:abstract":"Does water scarcity induce conflict? And who would engage in a water scarcity conflict? In this paper we look for evidence of the relation between water scarcity and conflictive behavior. With a framed field experiment conducted with smallholder irrigators\r\nfrom semi-arid Tanzania that replicates appropriation from an occasionally scarce common water flow we assess what type of water users is more inclined to react in conflictive way to\r\nscarcity. On average, water scarcity induces selfish appropriation behavior in the experiment which is regarded as conflictive in the Tanzanian irrigator communities where strong noncompetition\r\nnorms regulate irrigation water distribution. But not all react to water scarcity in the same way. Poor, marginalized, dissocialized irrigators with low human capital and with higher stakes are most likely to react with conflictive appropriation behavior to water scarcity. Viewed from a political ecology perspective we conclude that circumstances in Tanzania are conducive to resource scarcity conflicts. Water scarcity and water values are increasing, and\r\nwater governance institutions entail exclusionary elements. Moreover, a higher likelihood to react in a conflictive way to water scarcity coincides with real economic and political inequalities which could form a basis for mobilization for more violent ways of competing for scarce resources.","bibo:AuthorList":["D\u0027Exelle, Ben","Lecoutere, Els","Van Campenhout, Bjorn"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.29672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.294078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870866,"sim:weight":0.290777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.286314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.284473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.270553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.268208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.250861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767895,"sim:weight":0.250763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.248848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.248848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.248812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.248812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109092,"sim:weight":0.24374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767913,"sim:weight":0.231539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768028,"sim:weight":0.228374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.226626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43707,"sim:weight":0.225212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77201,"sim:weight":0.206483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85449,"sim:weight":0.192081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Changing and competing models of teacher professionalism under New Labour","bibo:abstract":"Since the 1988 Education Reform Act, the teacher’s role in England has changed in many ways, a process which intensified under New Labour after 1997. Conceptions of teacher professionalism have become more structured and formalized, often heavily influenced by government policy objectives. Career paths have become more diverse and specialised. In this article, three post-1997 professional roles are given consideration as examples of these new specialised career paths: Higher Level Teaching Assistants, Teach First trainees and Advanced Skills Teachers. The article goes on to examine such developments within teaching, using Bourdieu’s concept of  habitus to inform the analysis, as well as Bernstein’s theories of knowledge and identity. The article concludes that there has been considerable specialization and subsequent fragmentation of roles within the teaching profession, as part of workforce remodelling initiatives. However, there is still further scope for developing a greater sense of professional cohesion through social activism initiatives, such as the children\u0027s agenda. This may produce more stable professional identities in the future as the role of teachers within the wider children’s workforce is clarified.","bibo:AuthorList":["Leaton Gray, S","Whitty, Geoff"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83002,"sim:weight":0.536613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109250,"sim:weight":0.398422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99936,"sim:weight":0.38021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47136,"sim:weight":0.362626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158036,"sim:weight":0.360258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44940,"sim:weight":0.352481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154182,"sim:weight":0.349304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106236,"sim:weight":0.347562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146086,"sim:weight":0.34549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768812,"sim:weight":0.341421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151260,"sim:weight":0.334487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55859,"sim:weight":0.328596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710094,"sim:weight":0.328096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.321916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.319573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155962,"sim:weight":0.317739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2850,"sim:weight":0.314741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98717,"sim:weight":0.306458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653284,"sim:weight":0.300402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155211,"sim:weight":0.29313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The program was commissioned by the Department of Health and developed by a project team through the UK Committee of Postgraduate Dental Deans. The Dental Practice Board\r\nhad originally sent one copy of the CD-ROM to each dental practice in England in 2004.\r\nMethod A quantitative statistical analysis of the results of 326 online respondents to the learning package and a survey of 118 dental practitioners drawn from the Dental Practice Board database.\r\nResults Practitioners felt the CD-ROM in this instance was well designed and appropriate for their needs. It is inclusive and accessible to a wide range of dental professionals including nurses and hygienists.\r\nConclusions This form of continuing professional development is popular with dental practitioners, although it should not be the only form of continuing professional development available. However, whilst the project was generally regarded as successful, there were problems with the distribution of the CD-ROM. This suggests that an\r\nonline resource should be made available in the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Leaton Gray, Sandra","Howell, Catherine","Franklin, Chris"],"dc:date":"2007-09-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.389413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.383235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.382866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.377203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.374698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.367456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656477,"sim:weight":0.366163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.364504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.362763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.360923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9430057,"sim:weight":0.36083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.341669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.339116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.335869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.335429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.335429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.335429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.335429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.335429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.335429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper interrogates the norms that guide the state in its relief role, as well as the strategies deployed by disaster victims to access such relief.

In a study of neurotypical participants (nÂ \u003dÂ 179), we utilized a brief flanker interference task while varying the perceptual load of the visual display. Typically, increasing perceptual load (i.e., with greater numbers of search items) reduces interference from a competing peripheral distractor. We show that individuals who score above average on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) show stronger interference at high perceptual load than individuals with below-average AQ scores. This is consistent with recent findings in individuals with autism spectrum conditions, and supports the idea that the cognitive style of the autistic brain is reflected in a broader phenotype across the population.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bayliss, Andrew P","Kritikos, Ada"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.553213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99256,"sim:weight":0.533603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9017911,"sim:weight":0.532942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.408338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85405,"sim:weight":0.397367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.35233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98776,"sim:weight":0.335461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.334702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.334186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.334186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.334086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.334086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.328477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.325157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.32493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.322457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.322457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98836,"sim:weight":0.289538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.284713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145979,"sim:weight":0.283328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This social orienting response, joint attention, has been studied in the laboratory using the gaze cueing paradigm. Here, we investigate the combined influence of the emotional content displayed in two critical components of a joint attention episode: The facial expression of the cue face, and the affective nature of the to-be-localized target object. Hence, we presented participants with happy and disgusted faces as cueing stimuli, and neutral (Experiment 1), pleasant and unpleasant (Experiment 2) pictures as target stimuli. The findings demonstrate an effect of \u0027emotional context\u0027 confined to participants viewing pleasant pictures. Specifically, gaze cueing was boosted when the emotion of the gazing face (i.e., happy) matched that of the targets (pleasant). Demonstrating modulation by emotional context highlights the vital flexibility that a successful joint attention system requires in order to assist our navigation of the social world.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bayliss, Andrew P","Schuch, Stefanie","Tipper, Steven P"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2774396,"sim:weight":0.729654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2774398,"sim:weight":0.727929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.374087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.370934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26757,"sim:weight":0.36892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45942,"sim:weight":0.368144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43896,"sim:weight":0.34027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.337273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.337273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.337228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387313,"sim:weight":0.328966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.327892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.316844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.316844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586493,"sim:weight":0.315932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.313971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.313971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731301,"sim:weight":0.311998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.298113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.291988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Objects are the most basic form of property, so our physical interactions with owned objects may elucidate nuanced aspects of ownership. We gave participants a coffee mug to decorate, use and keep. The experimenter also designed a mug of her own. In Experiment 1, participants performed natural lifting actions with each mug. Participants lifted the Experimenter\u0027s mug with greater care, and moved it slightly more towards the Experimenter, while they lifted their own mug more forcefully and drew it closer to their own body. In Experiment 2, participants responded to stimuli presented on the mug handles in a computer-based stimulus-response compatibility task. Overall, participants were faster to respond in trials in which the handles were facing in the same direction as the response location compared to when the handles were facing away. The compatibility effect was abolished, however, for the Experimenter\u0027s mug - as if the action system is blind to the potential for action towards another person\u0027s property.

We investigated whether this effect is stronger when the observed action is relevant to the observer\u0027s task. The mu rhythm (oscillatory activity in the 8- to 13-Hz band over sensorimotor cortex) was measured while participants watched videos of grasping movements. In one of two conditions, the participants had to later report how many times they had seen a certain kind of grasp. In the other condition, they viewed the identical videos but had to later report how many times they had seen a certain colour change. The colour change and the grasp always occurred simultaneously. Results show mu rhythm attenuation when watching the videos relative to baseline. This attenuation was stronger when participants later reported the grasp rather than the colour, suggesting that the motor system is more strongly activated when the observed grasping actions were relevant to the observer\u0027s task. Moreover, when the graspable object disappeared after the offset of the video, there was subsequent mu rhythm enhancement, reflecting a post-stimulus inhibitory rebound. This enhancement was again stronger when making judgments about the grasp than the colour, suggesting that the stronger activation is followed by a stronger inhibitory rebound.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schuch, Stefanie","Bayliss, Andrew P.","Klein, Christoph","Tipper, Steven P."],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

By doing this, we are able to ground some of the proposals for reform made previously by Index on Censorship, English PEN, Lord Lester, and others. We do so, however, not through the prism of an over-weaned emphasis on freedom of expression, but rather by triangulating the rights and interests of claimants, defendants, and the wider public. Ultimately, we recommend a coherent set of significant substantive and procedural reforms that if enacted would enhance access to justice and reduce costs for all but the most serious and/or most damaging libels.

Three experimental diets were fed: (i) a control diet (CD) with 110 mg kg\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e Fe and 11.7 g kg\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e His; (ii) CD supplemented with crystalline His to a level of 18 g kg\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e (HD); and (iii) HD with added iron up to 220 mg kg\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e (HID). A cross-over design, with two feeding periods was used. A 6-week freshwater (FW) period was followed by a 20-week period, of which the first three were in FW and the following 17 weeks in sea water (SW). Fish were sampled for weighing, cataract assessment and tissue analysis at five time points. Cataracts developed in all groups in SW, but scores were lower in those fed high His diets (\u003cem\u003eP\u003c/em\u003e \u0026lt; 0.05). This effect was most pronounced when HD or HID was given in SW, but was also observed when these diets were given in FW only. Histidine supplementation had a positive effect on growth performance and feed conversion ratio (\u003cem\u003eP\u003c/em\u003e \u0026lt; 0.05), whereas this did not occur when iron was added. Groups fed HD or HID had higher lens levels of His and \u003cem\u003eN\u003c/em\u003e-acetyl histidine (NAH), the latter showing a marked increase post-smoltification (\u003cem\u003eP\u003c/em\u003e \u0026lt; 0.05).

In Atlantic salmon (\u003cspan class\u003d\"named-content genus-species\"\u003eSalmo salar\u003c/span\u003e L.), aqueous humor (AH) osmolality is greater in fish acclimated to seawater compared with young freshwater fish, and levels of lens \u003cem\u003eN\u003c/em\u003e-acetylhistidine (NAH) are much higher in seawater fish. Here we investigate NAH as an osmolyte in the lenses of salmon receiving diets either with or without histidine supplementation. In the histidine-supplemented diet (HD) histidine content was 14.2 g/kg, and in the control diet (CD) histidine content was 8.9 g/kg. A transient increase in AH osmolality of 20 mmol/kg was observed in fish transferred from freshwater to seawater. In a lens culture model, temporary decreases in volume and transparency were observed when lenses were exposed to hyperosmotic conditions. A positive linear relationship between extracellular osmolality and lens NAH content was also observed, whereas there was no change in lens histidine content. Hypoosmotic exposure stimulated\r\n [\u003csup\u003e14\u003c/sup\u003eC]-histidine efflux by 9.2- and 2.6-fold in CD and HD lenses, respectively. NAH efflux, measured by HPLC, was stimulated by hypoosmotic exposure to a much greater extent in HD lenses. In vivo, lens NAH increased in response to elevated AH osmolality in HD but not CD fish. In conclusion, NAH has an important and novel role as a compatible osmolyte in salmon lens. Furthermore, it is the major osmolyte that balances increases in AH osmolality  in NAH would lead to a dysfunction of the normal osmoregulatory processes in the lens, and we propose that this would contribute to cataract formation in fish deficient in histidine.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rhodes, JD","Breck, O","Waagbo, R","Bjerkas, E","Sanderson, J"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2774691,"sim:weight":0.73549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2774682,"sim:weight":0.511877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.113477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.110622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.110249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761116,"sim:weight":0.108263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761102,"sim:weight":0.10684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

After 12 months of feeding, plant diet-fed fish had smaller lenses with higher water contents and lower concentrations of histidine (His) and N-acetylhistidine (NAH) than fish fed with the marine diet. Cataract development in both dietary groups was minimal and no differences between the groups were observed. Lens fatty acid and lipid class composition differed minimally, although a significant increase in linoleic acid was observed. The lenses were examined for their ability to withstand osmotic disturbances ex vivo. Culture in hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic media led to increase and decrease of lens volume, respectively. Lenses from plant diet-fed fish were less resistant to swelling and shrinking, released less NAH into the culture medium, and accumulated His and NAH at higher rates than lenses from marine diet-fed fish. Culture in hypoosmotic medium resulted in higher cataract scores than in control and hyperosmotic medium. mRNA expression of selected genes, including glutathione peroxidase 4 and SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), was affected by diet and osmotic treatment. It can be concluded that lenses of farmed Atlantic salmon are affected by the diet composition, both in biochemical composition and physiological functionality in relation to osmoregulation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tröβe, C","Rhodes, JD","Sanderson, J","Breck, O","Waagbø, R"],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2774690,"sim:weight":0.73549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2774682,"sim:weight":0.544633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269997,"sim:weight":0.324829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269999,"sim:weight":0.31974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387126,"sim:weight":0.248325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.242023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23977,"sim:weight":0.237204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.237204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.227663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386784,"sim:weight":0.226187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26719,"sim:weight":0.22413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631895,"sim:weight":0.219385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.212426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632043,"sim:weight":0.206594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.204411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99085,"sim:weight":0.200939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387047,"sim:weight":0.200303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77267,"sim:weight":0.186083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.179109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.179109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The objectives of this study were to determine gene expression changes in human lens epithelial cells in response to quercetin and to investigate in detail the mechanisms underlying the responses. FHL-124 cells were treated with quercetin (10 μM) and changes in gene expression were measured by microarray. It was found that 65% of the genes with increased expression were regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway. Quercetin (10 and 30 μM) induced a time-dependent increase in HIF-1α protein levels. Quercetin (30 μM) was also responsible for a rapid and long-lasting translocation of HIF-1α from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Activation of HIF-1 signaling by quercetin was confirmed by qRT–PCR which showed upregulation of the HIF-1 regulated genes EPO, VEGF, PGK1 and BNIP3. Analysis of medium taken from FHL-124 cells showed a sustained dose-dependent increase in VEGF secretion following quercetin treatment. The quercetin-induced increase and nuclear translocation of HIF-1α was reversed by addition of excess iron (100 μM). These results demonstrate that quercetin activates the HIF-1 signaling pathway in human lens epithelial cells.","bibo:AuthorList":["Radreau, P","Rhodes, JD","Mithen, RC","Kroon, PA","Sanderson, J"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23816,"sim:weight":0.517417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98832,"sim:weight":0.458119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.23614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.22778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.208269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.201719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761102,"sim:weight":0.19599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.193564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.189678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229285,"sim:weight":0.187075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.183274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.180374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.180202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.179108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773164,"sim:weight":0.177343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.176298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.169187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44075,"sim:weight":0.163673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184423,"sim:weight":0.157852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.153044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study presents information about the magnitude and nature of civil antitrust actions in Germany. The data includes inter alia, information about the courts involved in litigation, the relationship of the parties, affected industries, the remedies sought, the outcome of the claim, the alleged anticompetitive conduct, the proportion of stand-alone and follow-on litigation, and the length of proceedings before a given court. The study shows that a large number of private cases were concluded even when compared with public investigations in Germany. It seems that private antitrust actions complement rather than duplicate public enforcement efforts because of the overwhelming proportion of stand-alone claims and the amount of actions based on the abuse of market power. Only a small number of litigants asked for the compensation of loss suffered from anticompetitive conduct. Interpreting the results from the study cautiously, the paper suggests that the European Commission and other stakeholders may have misunderstood the nature of private actions in Germany (and maybe Europe) and, consequently, asked the wrong question, focusing on compensation. Expensive damages actions for the breach of the antitrust rules might not be as important as commonly assumed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Peyer, Sebastian"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The determinants of trinucleotide R-loop formation are unclear. Trinucleotide repeat expansions cause diseases including DM1 (CTG)n, SCA1 (CAG)n, FRAXA (CGG)n, FRAXE (CCG)n and FRDA (GAA)n. Bidirectional convergent transcription across these disease repeats can occur. We find R-loops formed when CTG or CGG and their complementary strands CAG or CCG were transcribed; GAA transcription, but not TTC, yielded R-loops. R-loop formation was sensitive to DNA supercoiling, repeat length,\r\ninsensitive to repeat interruptions, and formed by extension of RNA:DNA hybrids in the RNA polymerase. R-loops arose by transcription in one direction followed by transcription in the opposite direction, and during simultaneous convergent bidirectional transcription of the same repeat forming double R-loop structures. Since each transcribed disease repeat formed R-loops suggests they may have biological functions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reddy, K","Tam, M","Bowater, RP","Barber, M","Tomlinson, M","Nichol Edamura, K","Wang, Y-H","Pearson, CE"],"dc:date":"2011-03-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

For redox enzymes this configuration allows quantification of the relationship between catalytic activity and electrochemical potential. Considered as a function\r\nof enzyme environment, i.e., pH, substrate concentration etc., the activity–potential relationship provides a fingerprint of activity unique to a given enzyme. Here we consider the nature of the activity–potential relationship in terms of both its cellular impact and its origin in the structure and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. We propose that the activity–potential relationship of a redox enzyme is tuned to facilitate cellular function and highlight opportunities to test this hypothesis through computational, structural, biochemical and cellular studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gates, AJ","Kemp, GL","To, CY","Mann, J","Marritt, SJ","Mayes, AG","Richardson, DJ","Butt, JN"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44440,"sim:weight":0.433469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776569,"sim:weight":0.376792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934790,"sim:weight":0.333089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26920,"sim:weight":0.33125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146046,"sim:weight":0.320774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2781132,"sim:weight":0.319013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.30654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84807,"sim:weight":0.294545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2971,"sim:weight":0.285994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85118,"sim:weight":0.281395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.279923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.279613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108030,"sim:weight":0.269884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381911,"sim:weight":0.266838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.261709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332856,"sim:weight":0.257996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43583,"sim:weight":0.256673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.255447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.250254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101346,"sim:weight":0.24854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We conclude that the most likely effect of the licence condition is to reduce\r\ncompetition in the mainstream energy markets, and welcome the regulator‟s latest review of the retail market.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hviid, Morten","Waddams Price, Catherine"],"dc:date":"2010-12-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.494611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5084151,"sim:weight":0.441455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382092,"sim:weight":0.419603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.39374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99495,"sim:weight":0.392276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.384688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47209,"sim:weight":0.375838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.374893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93450,"sim:weight":0.369215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.368252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9430797,"sim:weight":0.34885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.342141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.340787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.340787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.340787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.340787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.340787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.340787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.340787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.340787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Consistent with those theories, each oligopolist offered a single two-part electricity tariff, and a lump sum discount to consumers who purchased both electricity and gas. However, inconsistent with those theories, firms’ two-part tariffs are heterogeneous in ways that cannot be attributed to cost. We establish a series of stylised facts about the nature of these asymmetries between firms and use them to confront established theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Stephen","Waddams Price, Catherine","Wilson, Chris M"],"dc:date":"2009-05-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1352157,"sim:weight":0.495144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890292,"sim:weight":0.443137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382092,"sim:weight":0.413898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103104,"sim:weight":0.397298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773103,"sim:weight":0.395955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.391001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763917,"sim:weight":0.385854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.382375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.381975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.380261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.375637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.37358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93450,"sim:weight":0.370476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101499,"sim:weight":0.368954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18129,"sim:weight":0.36315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.346311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.344141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.344139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.344139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.344139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper describes the findings of research conducted in 1997, in collaboration with the Eritrean Ministry of Fisheries. The capture, transport and export of aquarium fish were reviewed and potential impacts and the status of management were investigated through liaison with stakeholders and researchers. From 1995 to 1997 two companies exported approximately 60,000 fish per year, mainly to the USA, worth US$65,000 (export value). Seventyfive species (from 22 families) were exported. Damselfishes made up two-thirds of total exports but more valuable families (angelfishes and butterflyfishes) were more economically significant. To earn revenue for Eritrea, a 20% export tax was imposed, although this was calculated from declarations by the operators. The emerging nature of the trade allowed detailed monitoring by the Ministry of Fisheries. However, management efforts were constrained by a lack of capacity for enforcement and baseline research. Several potential effects of the trade exist but other, land-based impacts may be more pressing concerns for Eritrea’s reefs. Research priorities for management are discussed as well as the implications of mariculture of Eritrean species by other nations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Daw, T.","Rogers, G.C.C.","Mapson, P.","Kynoch, J.E."],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145650,"sim:weight":0.421485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99092,"sim:weight":0.370739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181862,"sim:weight":0.323102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494504,"sim:weight":0.317384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.298452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.292974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.292974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.279431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.266652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.257352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.257352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.253929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.253426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.237868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.202179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.202179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84263,"sim:weight":0.195475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77201,"sim:weight":0.191716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In Gram-negative bacteria and mycobacteria, lipoproteins are further lipidated by lipoprotein N-acyl transferase (Lnt), to give triacylated lipoproteins. Streptomyces are unusual amongst Gram-positive bacteria because they export large numbers of lipoproteins via the twin arginine protein transport (Tat) pathway. Furthermore, some Streptomyces species encode two Lgt homologues and all Streptomyces species encode two homologues of Lnt. Here we characterize lipoprotein biogenesis in the plant pathogen Streptomyces scabies and report that lgt and lsp mutants are defective in growth and development while only moderately affected in virulence. Lipoproteins are lost from the membrane in an S. scabies lgt mutant but restored by expression of Streptomyces coelicolor lgt1 or lgt2 confirming that both encode functional Lgt enzymes. Furthermore, lipoproteins are N-acylated in Streptomyces with efficient N-acylation dependent on Lnt1 and Lnt2. However, deletion of lnt1 and lnt2 has no effect on growth, development or virulence. We thus present a detailed study of lipoprotein biogenesis in Streptomyces, the first study of Lnt function in a monoderm bacterium and the first study of bacterial lipoproteins as virulence factors in a plant pathogen.","bibo:AuthorList":["Widdick, DA","Hicks, MG","Thompson, BJ","Tschumi, A","Chandra, G","Sutcliffe, IC","Brülle, JK","Sander, P","Palmer, T","Hutchings, MI"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2773718,"sim:weight":0.635731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773714,"sim:weight":0.537981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767998,"sim:weight":0.501391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773716,"sim:weight":0.308447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.266806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2756271,"sim:weight":0.207839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102928,"sim:weight":0.164182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101465,"sim:weight":0.134263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229189,"sim:weight":0.133746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45205,"sim:weight":0.133143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768022,"sim:weight":0.132073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45631,"sim:weight":0.127045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44537,"sim:weight":0.125134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772412,"sim:weight":0.121651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.121306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46909,"sim:weight":0.117606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45241,"sim:weight":0.10697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47544,"sim:weight":0.0907915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46869,"sim:weight":0.0832773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45405,"sim:weight":0.0821044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

From the moment MTB is exhaled by infected individuals, through an active and latent phase in the body of the new host, until the time they reach the reactivation stage, MTB is exposed to many types of DNA-damaging agents. Like all cellular organisms, MTB has efficient DNA repair systems, and these are believed to play essential roles in mycobacterial pathogenesis. As different stages of infection have great variation in the conditions in which mycobacteria reside, it is possible that different repair systems are essential for progression to specific phases of infection. MTB possesses homologues of DNA repair systems that are found widely in other species of bacteria, such as nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair and repair by homologous recombination. MTB also possesses a system for non-homologous end-joining of DNA breaks, which appears to be widespread in prokaryotes, although its presence is sporadic within different species within a genus. However, MTB does not possess homologues of the typical mismatch repair system that is found in most bacteria. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNA repair genes are expressed differentially at each stage of infection. In the present review, we focus on different DNA repair systems from mycobacteria and identify questions that remain in our understanding of how these systems have an impact upon the infection processes of these important pathogens.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorna, AE","Bowater, RP","Dziadek, J"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":105092,"sim:weight":0.555035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75896,"sim:weight":0.449503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":778973,"sim:weight":0.42115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.403805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.402993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222944,"sim:weight":0.374003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710568,"sim:weight":0.373813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710687,"sim:weight":0.37305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75329,"sim:weight":0.349781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.344253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772293,"sim:weight":0.336127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98501,"sim:weight":0.335061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101385,"sim:weight":0.31708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154372,"sim:weight":0.314696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76172,"sim:weight":0.30901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98662,"sim:weight":0.270742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709941,"sim:weight":0.269442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101609,"sim:weight":0.268016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632033,"sim:weight":0.26751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.253445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We attempt to fill this void by developing a simple theoretical model of nutritional label use, incorporating the time a consumer spends reading labels as part of the food choice process. The demand equations of the model are then empirically tested.

In many ways this represents a new departure for development studies, which has been largely uninterested in religion in the past. This growing interest in religion can be explained through a number of inter linking factors, including the persistence of religion in much of the world, and the sense that existing approaches to development have been ineffective. In reviewing this literature we put forward three broad criticisms. First, that the literature is instrumentalist in its approach; it is interested in understanding how religion can be used to do development “better”. Second, that it has a narrow focus on faith-based organisations; which is, in many ways, a consequence of the need to understand religion instrumentally. Third, that it is based on normative assumptions in terms of how both religion and development are conceptualised: religion is understood to be apart from “mainstream” development; while development is defined as that thing that development agencies do. In making sense of these criticisms we emphasise the extent to which recent interest in religion and development has come from donors and development agencies. We found little evidence of academic research on religion and development prefiguring the interest of the World Bank or bilateral agencies. The article concludes with some suggestions of how to move forward.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Ben","Juul Petersen, Marie"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43683,"sim:weight":0.513469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9552783,"sim:weight":0.464077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76118,"sim:weight":0.450929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75552,"sim:weight":0.418531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145887,"sim:weight":0.413819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43833,"sim:weight":0.404804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.400179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197556,"sim:weight":0.395502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.381806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43653,"sim:weight":0.370684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85449,"sim:weight":0.369211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86060,"sim:weight":0.357875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631615,"sim:weight":0.354983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108129,"sim:weight":0.352995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47230,"sim:weight":0.342868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78043,"sim:weight":0.342733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44140,"sim:weight":0.340386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.328039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.325842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.320839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Many non-histone proteins are also targeted for acetylation, including TGF-β signalling pathway components such as Smad2, Smad3 and Smad7. Our studies in mouse C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts suggested that a number of TGF-β-induced genes that regulate matrix turnover are selectively regulated by HDACs. Blockade of HDAC activity with trichostatin A (TSA) abrogated the induction of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 12 (Adam12) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (Timp-1) genes by TGF-β, whereas plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (Pai-1) expression was unaffected. Analysis of the activation of cell signalling pathways demonstrated that TGF-β induced robust ERK and PI3K activation with delayed kinetics compared to the phosphorylation of Smads. The TGF-β induction of Adam12 and Timp-1 was dependent on such non-Smad signalling pathways and, importantly, HDAC inhibitors completely blocked their activation without affecting Smad signalling. Analysis of TGF-β-induced Adam12 and Timp-1 expression and ERK/PI3K signalling in the presence of semi-selective HDAC inhibitors valproic acid, MS-275 and apicidin implicated a role for class I HDACs. Furthermore, depletion of HDAC3 by RNA interference significantly down-regulated TGF-β-induced Adam12 and Timp-1 expression without modulating Pai-1 expression. Correlating with the effect of HDAC inhibitors, depletion of HDAC3 also blocked the activation of ERK and PI3K by TGF-β. Collectively, these data confirm that HDACs, and in particular HDAC3, are required for activation of the ERK and PI3K signalling pathways by TGF-β and for the subsequent gene induction dependent on these signalling pathways.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barter, MJ","Pybus, L","Litherland, GJ","Rowan, AD","Clark, IM","Edwards, DR","Cawston, TE","Young, DA"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2761117,"sim:weight":0.448582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76062,"sim:weight":0.347641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99258,"sim:weight":0.311987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631895,"sim:weight":0.310209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23819,"sim:weight":0.306316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585897,"sim:weight":0.289138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222792,"sim:weight":0.285503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76804,"sim:weight":0.285021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632033,"sim:weight":0.273472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76007,"sim:weight":0.271134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146196,"sim:weight":0.26947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105102,"sim:weight":0.267262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631517,"sim:weight":0.2669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.255119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75980,"sim:weight":0.247174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.245166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.241665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.224733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.224224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.220932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this study was to assess the role of the transmembrane serine proteinase matriptase in cartilage destruction in osteoarthritis (OA).\r\nSerine proteinase gene expression in femoral head cartilage obtained from either patients with hip OA or patients with fracture to the neck of the femur (NOF) was assessed using a low-density array. The effect of matriptase on collagen breakdown was determined in cartilage degradation models, while the effect on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. ProMMP processing was determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/N-terminal sequencing, while its ability to activate proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) was determined using a synovial perfusion assay in mice.\r\nMatriptase gene expression was significantly elevated in OA cartilage compared with NOF cartilage, and matriptase was immunolocalized to OA chondrocytes. We showed that matriptase activated proMMP-1 and processed proMMP-3 to its fully active form. Exogenous matriptase significantly enhanced cytokine-stimulated cartilage collagenolysis, while matriptase alone caused significant collagenolysis from OA cartilage, which was metalloproteinase-dependent. Matriptase also induced MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 gene expression. Synovial perfusion data confirmed that matriptase activates PAR-2, and we demonstrated that matriptase-dependent enhancement of collagenolysis from OA cartilage is blocked by PAR-2 inhibition.\r\nElevated matriptase expression in OA and the ability of matriptase to activate selective proMMPs as well as induce collagenase expression make this serine proteinase a key initiator and inducer of cartilage destruction in OA. We propose that the indirect effects of matriptase are mediated by PAR-2, and a more detailed understanding of these mechanisms may highlight important new therapeutic targets for OA treatment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Milner, JM","Patel, A","Davidson, RK","Swingler, TE","Desilets, A","Young, DA","Kelso, EB","Donell, ST","Cawston, TE","Clark, IM","Ferrell, WR","Plevin, R","Lockhart, JC","Leduc, R","Rowan, AD"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":897707,"sim:weight":0.57152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776586,"sim:weight":0.511581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761117,"sim:weight":0.503666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769017,"sim:weight":0.330504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929810,"sim:weight":0.283192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23815,"sim:weight":0.282051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222879,"sim:weight":0.27411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.273662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177260,"sim:weight":0.261757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9028213,"sim:weight":0.240276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.236221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.234598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.234205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.232807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.230594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77287,"sim:weight":0.225326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631669,"sim:weight":0.22193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.217208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.211989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222903,"sim:weight":0.210979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The morphology and extent of dispersion of ibuprofen and layered silicate was studied using a combination of wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Exhaustive examination across the length scales revealed the composite to have both an intercalated and exfoliated morphology. The ibuprofen was well dispersed and distributed throughout the PCL matrix. Most significantly, the static tensile and dynamic mechanical properties of PCL can be manipulated as a function of nanoclay loading and is dependent on the aspect ratio of clay platelets. The glass transition of PCL increased by up to 16A degrees C on addition of nanoclay, as determined from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). This behaviour was attributed to the constrained mobility of PCL chains intercalated between clay platelets and to the tethering of PCL chains by hydrogen bonding with platelet edges. As a consequence, PCL crystallisation was inhibited and confirmed from non-isothermal crystallisation experiments using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The fraction of PCL that was crystalline (X-c) decreased by 15% on addition of ibuprofen and nanoclay, although the temperature of crystallisation (T-c) did not change significantly. The dissolution of ibuprofen from PCL can be retarded by addition of layered silicates (nanoclays) to the polymer matrix.","bibo:AuthorList":["Campbell,  K. T.","Craig,  D. Q.

Control over MMP and/or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) activity in vivo occurs at different levels and involves factors such as regulation of gene expression, activation of zymogens and inhibition of active enzymes by specific inhibitors. Whilst these enzymes and inhibitors have clear roles in physiological tissue turnover and homeostasis, if control of their expression or activity is lost, they contribute to a number of pathologies including e.g. cancer, arthritis and cardiovascular disease. The expression of many MMPs and TIMPs is regulated at the level of transcription by a variety of growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, though post-transcriptional pathways may contribute to this regulation in specific cases. The contribution of epigenetic modifications has also been uncovered in recent years.

CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), a transcription factor, is expressed in rodent brains in response to neuroinflammation, implicating it in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and HAND.

In vitro, HAND-relevant stimuli additively induce C/EBPβ nuclear expression in human astrocytes through 7 days of treatment. Over-expression of C/EBPβ increases TIMP-1 promoter activity, mRNA, and protein levels in human astrocytes activated with interleukin-1β.

Compared with wild-type mouse perivascular cells, AnxA5-null cells exhibit a severe membrane repair defect. Membrane repair in AnxA5-null cells is rescued by addition of AnxA5, which binds exclusively to disrupted membrane areas. In contrast, an AnxA5 mutant that lacks the ability of forming 2D arrays is unable to promote membrane repair. We propose that AnxA5 participates in a previously unrecognized step of the membrane repair process: triggered by the local influx of Ca2+, AnxA5 proteins bind to torn membrane edges and form a 2D array, which prevents wound expansion and promotes membrane resealing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bouter, A","Gounou, C","Bérat, R","Tan, S","Gallois, B","Granier, T","d\u0027Estaintot, BL","Pöschl, E","Brachvogel, B","Brisson, AR"],"dc:date":"2011-04-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6205917,"sim:weight":0.332855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269867,"sim:weight":0.326519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.315308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46577,"sim:weight":0.295922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98959,"sim:weight":0.295772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.295512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.283814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.280064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75424,"sim:weight":0.279014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.27803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45616,"sim:weight":0.277656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.2697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.269493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.252152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631793,"sim:weight":0.249393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.2487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.241705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.231797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632033,"sim:weight":0.230298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75622,"sim:weight":0.228348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, both the extent to which declines in coral cover lead to declines in complexity and the length of time it takes for reefs to collapse following coral mortality are unknown. Here we assess the extent of temporal and spatial covariation between coral cover and reef architectural complexity using a Caribbean-wide dataset of temporally replicated estimates spanning four decades. Both coral cover and architectural complexity have declined rapidly over time, with little evidence of a time-lag. However, annual rates of change in coral cover and complexity do not covary, and levels of complexity vary greatly among reefs with similar coral cover. These findings suggest that the stressors influencing Caribbean reefs are sufficiently severe and widespread to produce similar regional-scale declines in coral cover and reef complexity, even though reef architectural complexity is not a direct function of coral cover at local scales. Given that architectural complexity is not a simple function of coral cover, it is important that conservation monitoring and restoration give due consideration to both architecture and coral cover. This will help ensure that the ecosystem services supported by architectural complexity, such as nutrient recycling, dissipation of wave energy, fish production and diversity, are maintained and enhanced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alvarez-Filip, L","Cote, IM","Gill, JA","Watkinson, AR","Dulvy, NK"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Here we explore the markets for snakes from Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia to evaluate future exploitation scenarios, identify entry points for conservation and, more generally, to illustrate the value of multi-scale analysis of markets to traded wildlife conservation. In Cambodia, the largest driver of snake exploitation is the domestic trade in snakes as crocodile food. We estimate that farmed crocodiles consume between 2.7 and 12.2 million snakes per year. The market price for crocodiles has been in decline since 2003, which, combined with rising prices for their food, has led to a reduced frequency of feeding and closure of small farms. The large farms that generate a disproportionate amount of the demand for snakes continue to operate in anticipation of future market opportunities, and preferences for snakes could help maintain demand if market prices for crocodiles rise to pre 2003 levels. In the absence of a sustained demand from crocodile farms, it is also possible that alternative markets will develop, such as one for human snack food. The demand for snakes, however, also depends on the availability of substitute resources, principally fish. The substitutability and low price elasticity of demand offers a relatively sustainable form of consumerism. Given the nature of these market drivers, addressing consumer preferences and limiting the protection of snakes to their breeding season are likely to be the most effective tools for conservation. This study highlights the importance of understanding the structure of markets and the behaviour of consumer demand prior to implementing regulations on wildlife hunting and trade.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brooks, SE","Allison, EH","Gill, JA","Reynolds, JD"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As causes of these declines exist across both the breeding and non-breeding season, identifying potential drivers of population change is complex. In order to explore the roles of changes in regional and local environmental conditions on population change, we examine spatial and temporal variation in population trajectories of one of Europe’s most abundant Afro-Palaearctic summer migrants, the willow warbler, Phylloscopus trochilus.\r\n\r\nBritain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nWe use national survey data from Britain and Ireland (BBS: BTO/RSPB/JNCC Breeding Bird Survey and CBS: BWI/NPWS/Heritage Council Countryside Breeding Survey) from 1994 to 2006 to model the spatial and temporal variation in willow warbler population trends.\r\n\r\nAcross Britain and Ireland, population trends follow a gradient from sharp declines in the south and east of England to shallow declines and/or slight increases in parts of north and west England, across Scotland and Ireland. Decreasing the spatial scale of analysis reveals variation in both the rate and spatial extent of population change within central England and the majority of Scotland. The rates of population change also vary temporally; declines in the south of England are shallower now than at the start of the time series, whereas populations further north in Britain have undergone periods of increase and decline.\r\n\r\nThese patterns suggest that regional-scale drivers, such as changing climatic conditions, and local-scale processes, such as habitat change, are interacting to produce spatially variable population trends. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying these interactions and the challenges in addressing such changes at scales relevant to migratory species.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morrison, CA","Robinson, RA","Clark, JA","Gill, JA"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8764132,"sim:weight":0.443906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62510,"sim:weight":0.422054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761111,"sim:weight":0.419134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.386082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.386081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.379483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62227,"sim:weight":0.364763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60875,"sim:weight":0.343726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97600,"sim:weight":0.335055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.33487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.33298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.328332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386270,"sim:weight":0.327435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60138,"sim:weight":0.322745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154311,"sim:weight":0.322114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269922,"sim:weight":0.321595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62279,"sim:weight":0.320174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":359658,"sim:weight":0.310771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":359802,"sim:weight":0.304789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62195,"sim:weight":0.303747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Multiple FGFR2 splice variants are generated through alternative splicing, including PTC (premature termination codon)-containing transcripts that are normally eliminated via the NMD (nonsense-mediated decay) pathway. We have discovered that a soluble truncated FGFR2 molecule encoded by a PTC-containing transcript is up-regulated and persists in tissues of an AS mouse model. We have termed this IIIa–TM as it arises from aberrant splicing of FGFR2 exon 7 (IIIa) into exon 10 [TM (transmembrane domain)]. IIIa–TM is glycosylated and can modulate the binding of FGF1 to FGFR2 molecules in BIAcore-binding assays. We also show that IIIa–TM can negatively regulate FGF signalling in vitro and in vivo. AS phenotypes are thought to result from gain-of-FGFR2 signalling, but our findings suggest that IIIa–TM can contribute to these through a loss-of-FGFR2 function mechanism. Moreover, our findings raise the interesting possibility that FGFR2 signalling may be a regulator of the NMD pathway.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wheldon, LM","Khodabukus, N","Patey, SJ","Smith, TG","Heath, JK","Hajihosseini, MK"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9257203,"sim:weight":0.0752168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

N2OR contains two metal centers; a binuclear copper center, CuA, that serves to receive electrons from soluble donors, and a tetranuclear copper-sulfide center, CuZ, at the active site. Stopped flow experiments at low ionic strengths reveal rapid electron transfer (kobs \u003d 150 s−1) between reduced horse heart (HH) cytochrome c and the CuA center in fully oxidized N2OR. When fully reduced N2OR was mixed with oxidized cytochrome c, a similar rate of electron transfer was recorded for the reverse reaction, followed by a much slower internal electron transfer from CuZ to CuA (kobs \u003d 0.1–0.4 s−1). The internal electron transfer process is likely to represent the rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle. Remarkably, in the absence of cytochrome c, fully reduced N2OR is inert towards its substrate, even though sufficient electrons are stored to initiate a single turnover. However, in the presence of reduced cytochrome c and N2O, a single turnover occurs after a lag-phase. We propose that a conformational change in N2OR is induced by its specific interaction with cytochrome c that in turn either permits electron transfer between CuA and CuZ or controls the rate of N2O decomposition at the active site.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rasmussen, Tim","Brittain, Thomas","Berks, Ben C.","Watmough, NJ","Thomson, AJ"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4870225,"sim:weight":0.387451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775724,"sim:weight":0.376792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.326188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.317315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.312736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2971,"sim:weight":0.267075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43961,"sim:weight":0.238801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890301,"sim:weight":0.235088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205917,"sim:weight":0.226123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890299,"sim:weight":0.223762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113592,"sim:weight":0.218117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.214274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.207904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1625899,"sim:weight":0.203586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710562,"sim:weight":0.201748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.201595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4876220,"sim:weight":0.193378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43583,"sim:weight":0.189242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.1862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381911,"sim:weight":0.18614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the study presented here, we have performed a replicated experiment with the plant Nigella degenii to explore the quantitative genetic effects of a single-founder bottleneck. In agreement with additive theory, the bottleneck reduced the mean (co)variance within lines and caused stochastic, line-specific changes in the genetic (co)variance structure. However, a significant portion of the (co)variance structure was conserved, and 2 characters—leaf and flower (sepal) size—turned out to be positively correlated in all data sets, indicating a potential for correlated evolution in these characters, even after a severe bottleneck. The hierarchical partitioning of genetic variance for flower size was in good agreement with predictions from additive theory, whereas the remaining characters showed an excess of within-line variance and a deficiency of among-line variance. The latter discrepancies were most likely a result of selection, given the small proportion of lines (23%) that remained viable until the end of the experiment. Our results suggest that bottlenecked populations of N. degenii generally have a lower adaptive potential than the ancestral population but also highlight the idiosyncratic nature of bottleneck effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andersson, S","Ellmer, M","Jorgensen, TH","Palme, A"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98876,"sim:weight":0.41845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631478,"sim:weight":0.382077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384807,"sim:weight":0.372067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60227,"sim:weight":0.349583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.313086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.303173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387066,"sim:weight":0.296377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.29432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.29432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62357,"sim:weight":0.288752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.287197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222917,"sim:weight":0.273073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.272383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.272374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.272256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46904,"sim:weight":0.272083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.271774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.26872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61296,"sim:weight":0.251024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.230907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, when comparing results from different studies it is evident the reported material properties, particularly failure strains, vary hugely. The aim of our study was to characterize how and why specimen length and cross-sectional area (CSA) appear to influence failure stress, strain and modulus in fascicles from two functionally different tendons. Fascicles were dissected from five rat tails and five bovine foot extensors, their diameters determined by a laser micrometer, and loaded to failure at a range of grip-to-grip lengths. Strain to failure significantly decreased with increasing in specimen length in both rat and bovine fascicles, while modulus increased. Specimen length did not influence failure stress in rat tail fascicles, although in bovine fascicles it was significantly lower in the longer 40 mm specimens compared to 5 and 10 mm specimens. The variations in failure strain and modulus with sample length could be predominantly explained by end-effects. However, it was also evident that strain fields along the sample length were highly variable and notably larger towards the ends of the sample than the mid-section even at distances in excess of 5 mm from the gripping points. Failure strain, stress and modulus correlated significantly with CSA at certain specimen lengths. Our findings have implications for the mechanical testing of tendon tissue: while it is not always possible to control for fascicle length and/or CSA, these parameters have to be taken into account when comparing samples of different dimensions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Legerlotz, K","Riley, GP","Screen, H"],"dc:date":"2010-08-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Tendons possess a highly organized fibrillar matrix, consisting of type I collagen and various \u0027minor\u0027 collagens, proteoglycans and glycoproteins. The tendon matrix is maintained by the resident tenocytes, and there is evidence of a continuous process of matrix remodeling, although the rate of turnover varies at different sites. A change in remodeling activity is associated with the onset of tendinopathy. Major molecular changes include increased expression of type III collagen, fibronectin, tenascin C, aggrecan and biglycan. These changes are consistent with repair, but they might also be an adaptive response to changes in mechanical loading. Repeated minor strain is thought to be the major precipitating factor in tendinopathy, although further work is required to determine whether it is mechanical overstimulation or understimulation that leads to the change in tenocyte activity. Metalloproteinase enzymes have an important role in the tendon matrix, being responsible for the degradation of collagen and proteoglycan in both healthy patients and those with disease. Metalloproteinases that show increased expression in painful tendinopathy include ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase)-12 and MMP (matrix metalloproteinase)-23. The role of these enzymes in tendon pathology is unknown, and further work is required to identify novel and specific molecular targets for therapy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Riley, G"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2776643,"sim:weight":0.842432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776591,"sim:weight":0.823843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2756790,"sim:weight":0.728294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387114,"sim:weight":0.629322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109129,"sim:weight":0.441448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776586,"sim:weight":0.42099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13987,"sim:weight":0.418766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631793,"sim:weight":0.405591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.276124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75567,"sim:weight":0.267108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761102,"sim:weight":0.266462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761117,"sim:weight":0.262729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631685,"sim:weight":0.254906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.252313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387003,"sim:weight":0.250976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9552795,"sim:weight":0.242324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75539,"sim:weight":0.240525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.237173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222879,"sim:weight":0.234489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.231087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A common feature of these pathologies is degenerative changes in the structure of the tissue which is mediated, at least in part, by proteolytic activity. Most tissues of the synovial joint are composed primarily of extracellular matrix and key pathological roles in the degeneration of this matrix are performed by metalloproteinases such as matrix metallproteinases (MMPs) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS).

We tested the hypothesis that changes in the expression of specific metalloproteinases underlie or contribute to the fibrosis and contracture seen in DD.\r\nWe collected tissue from patients with DD and used normal palmar fascia as a control.

The expression of 3 key collagenases, MMP1, MMP13, and MMP14 is increased significantly in the DD nodule, as is the expression of the collagen biosynthetic enzyme ADAMTS14. The expression of MMP7, an enzyme with broad substrate specificity, is increased in the DD nodule and remains equally expressed in the DD cord. TIMP1 expression is increased significantly in DD nodule compared with normal palmar fascia.\r\nThis study measured the expression of all MMP, ADAMTS, and TIMP genes in DD. Contraction and fibrosis may result from: (1) increased collagen biosynthesis mediated by increased ADAMTS-14; (2) an increased level of TIMP-1 blocking MMP-1– and MMP-13–mediated collagenolysis; and (3) contraction enabled by MMP-14–mediated pericellular collagenolysis (and potentially MMP-7), which may escape inhibition by TIMP-1.

The tendon cell response to repeated minor injuries or “overuse” is thought to be a major factor in the development of tendinopathy. Changes in matrix turnover may also be effected by the cellular response to physical load, altering the balance of matrix turnover and changing the structure and composition of the tendon. Matrix turnover is relatively high in tendons exposed to high mechanical demands, such as the supraspinatus and Achilles, and this is thought to represent either a repair or tissue maintenance function. Metalloproteinases are a large family of enzymes capable of degrading all of the tendon matrix components, and these are thought to play a major role in the degradation of matrix during development, adaptation and repair. It is proposed that some metalloproteinase enzymes are required for the health of the tendon, and others may be damaging, leading to degeneration of the tissue.

We have assessed the effects of EGCG and its non-esterified counterpart EGC on the expression of the collagenases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1 and -13, and the stromelysin, MMP-3, in human tendon-derived fibroblasts. Interleukin (IL)-1β increased MMP-1, -3 and -13 mRNA and output at least 30-fold.

MMPs were extracted from ruptured supraspinatus tendons (n\u003d10), macroscopically normal (‘control’) supraspinatus tendons (n\u003d29) and normal short head of biceps brachii tendons (n\u003d24). Enzyme activity was measured using fluorogenic substrates selective for MMP-1, MMP-3 and enzymes with gelatinolytic activity (MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13). Collagen denaturation was determined by α-chymotrypsin digestion. Protein turnover was determined by measuring the percentage of d-aspartic acid (% d-Asp). Zymography was conducted to identity specific gelatinases. MMP-1 activity was higher in ruptured supraspinatus compared to control supraspinatus and normal biceps brachii tendons (70.9, 26.4 and 11.5 fmol/mg tendon, respectively; P\u003c0.001). Gelatinolytic and MMP-3 activities were lower in normal biceps brachii and ruptured supraspinatus compared to control supraspinatus (gelatinase: 0.18, 0.23 and 0.82 RFU/s/mg tendon respectively; P\u003c0.001; MMP-3: 9.0, 8.6 and 55 fmol/mg tendon, respectively; P\u003c0.001).

We conclude that the short head of biceps brachii tendons show little protein turnover, whereas control supraspinatus tendons show relatively high turnover mediated by the activity of MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-1. This activity is thought to represent a repair or maintenance function that may be associated with an underlying degenerative process caused by a history of repeated injury and/or mechanical strain. After tendon rupture, there was increased activity of MMP-1, reduced activity of MMP-2 and MMP-3, increased turnover and further deterioration in the quality of the collagen network. Tendon degeneration is shown to be an active, cell-mediated process that may result from a failure to regulate specific MMP activities in response to repeated injury or mechanical strain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Riley, GP","Curry, V","DeGroot, J","van El, B","Verzijl, N","Hazleman, BL","Bank, RA"],"dc:date":"2002-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2776591,"sim:weight":0.673636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2776586,"sim:weight":0.51151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Since TGF-β is strongly associated with tissue repair, we investigated the expression of TGF-β isoforms (β1, β2 and β3) and their 2 signalling receptors (TGF-βRI and TGF-βRII) in normal and pathological Achilles tendons. In all tissues, all 3 TGF-β isoforms and the 2 receptors were present at sites of blood vessels. Cells in the matrix showed no staining for TGF-β1 or β3, while TGF-β2 was associated with cells throughout the normal cadaver tendon. Tissue from tendons with pathological lesions showed an increase in cell numbers and percentage TGF-β2 expression. TGF-βRII showed a wide distribution in cells throughout the tissue sections. As with TGF-β2, there was an increase in the number of cells expressing TGF-βRII in pathological tissue. TGF-βRI was restricted to blood vessels and was absent from the fibrillar matrix. We conclude that despite the presence and upregulation of TGF-β2, TGF-β signalling is not propagated due to the lack of TGF-βRI. This might explain why chronic tendon lesions fail to resolve and suggests that the addition of exogenous TGF-β will have little effect on chronic tendinopathy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fenwick, SA","Curry, V","Harrall, RL","Hazleman, BL","Hackney, R","Riley, GP"],"dc:date":"2001-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The greatest difference between normal (post-mortem) and degenerate tissue samples was in the level of MMP-3 (stromelysin) mRNA, which was down-regulated in all the degenerate samples. Quantitative RT-PCR assay of RNA extracted from paired ‘normal’ and degenerate Achilles tendon tissue samples taken from tendons during surgery mirrored the results of the arrays. Levels of MMP-3 mRNA were lower, whereas levels of type-I and type-III collagen mRNAs were significantly higher, in the degenerate compared to the ‘normal’ samples. Immunoblotting of proteins extracted from the same tendon samples showed that three of four normal tissue samples taken from individuals without apparent tendon disorder had much higher levels of MMP-3 protein than ‘normal’ or degenerate samples from patients with tendinosis.

Nitric oxide (NO), the product of this enzyme, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both conditions. However, there are conflicting data on whether iNOS is expressed in the normal, uninflamed human colon.\r\nTo evaluate the expression of iNOS in histologically normal, non-inflamed human colonic mucosa.\r\nReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the expression of iNOS in 17 histologically normal specimens obtained at colectomy performed for colorectal neoplasia. In addition, 16 endoscopic mucosal biopsies, taken from normal individuals, were also evaluated. Eleven surgical specimens and 16 endoscopic biopsies from patients with refractory ulcerative colitis were used as inflammatory controls.\r\nAll types of specimens expressed iNOS mRNA. Immunoblotting revealed a protein of approximately 130 kDa consistent with iNOS in mucosal extracts of 77% of normal individuals, and 85% of diseased controls. Immunolabelling localised this protein to the surface epithelium in most of the normal specimens and also to the crypt epithelium and inflammatory cells in the diseased controls.\r\nThese findings provide evidence that iNOS is often expressed in the surface epithelium of non-inflamed human colon, suggesting that it is induced by local luminal factors, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). The resultant NO produced at this site might act as an oxidative barrier, reducing bacterial translocation and providing a means of defence against pathogenic microorganisms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roberts, PJ","Riley, GP","Morgan, K","Miller, R","Hunter, JO","Middleton, SJ"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":177313,"sim:weight":0.146498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177363,"sim:weight":0.116075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177251,"sim:weight":0.0949815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The evolution of dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) is likely to have been strongly influenced by inter-specific competition, leading to niche partitioning. We consider whether local-scale processes leave a signature in regional patterns of functional diversity in dung beetle assemblages, and investigate the correlation between total exploited ecomorphological space and density of species packing with increased species richness. We test whether ecomorphological space occupied by local assemblages reflects that of their regional species pool, and the extent to which ecomorphological space is convergent or divergent within functional groups across regional pools.\r\nNeotropics, Africa, Australia and Madagascar.\r\nDung beetle assemblages were collected in a standardized manner from four biogeographic regions. Ecomorphological similarity among the assemblages was assessed by multivariate analysis of 19 linear measurements for 300 species and three functional nesting types (roller, tunneller or dweller), firstly on a local level within the Neotropics and Afrotropics, and then between the regional species pools.\r\nKey body measurements, in particular the hind tibia, separated rollers and tunnellers into largely non-overlapping entities along the first three axes of the shape analysis. Three Neotropical assemblages, which vary widely in species numbers, each harboured a similar amount of morphometric variation, resulting in increasingly dense species packing with greater species richness. Similar findings were obtained in two South African assemblages. Assemblages in the four biogeographic regions showed largely similar distributions of ecomorphological variation, including the separation of rollers and tunnellers, despite their distant phylogenetic relationships. Ecomorphological similarity among regions was particularly high in tunnellers, whilst the rollers exhibited greater regional differentiation.\r\nLocal assemblages evidently represent the full diversity of functional groups available in the regional pool, even in species-poor assemblages. There is a strong trend towards convergence in morphology separating tunnellers and rollers in phylogenetically independent lineages. The ecomorphological similarity of regional assemblages suggests that morphological convergence is the result of common selective forces active within the assemblages themselves. This lends support to the widely hypothesized effect of inter-specific interactions and niche partitioning in determining assemblage composition and lineage evolution in the Scarabaeinae.","bibo:AuthorList":["Inward, DJG","Davies, RG","Pergande, C","Denham, AJ","Vogler, AP"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1108338,"sim:weight":0.589413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43383,"sim:weight":0.418264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99304,"sim:weight":0.36412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.319101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3152,"sim:weight":0.318605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631109,"sim:weight":0.317051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59935,"sim:weight":0.314461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.311226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62150,"sim:weight":0.307833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62357,"sim:weight":0.305614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769014,"sim:weight":0.304264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.295555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76858,"sim:weight":0.292386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75387,"sim:weight":0.292386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.290122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.29012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.287142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.283529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62510,"sim:weight":0.282924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61296,"sim:weight":0.282679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here we have investigated whether overexpression of α5β1 directly affects uPAR-dependent pericellular proteolysis. CHO cells overexpressing α5β1 were found to activate plasminogen at a rate up to 18-fold faster than B2CHO cells which are α5-deficient. This effect was dependent on the activation state of α5β1, as it was maximal in the presence of Mn2+. To determine the role of uPAR-α5β1 interactions in this effect, we determined the adhesion of these cells to immobilised soluble uPAR (suPAR). Neither cell-type was found to adhere to suPAR, but both cell types were found to adhere to an anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody in a uPAR- and integrin-dependent manner. This adhesion was 10-fold greater in the absence of α5β1, possibly implicating the involvement of non-α5-integrins. Soluble forms of the various components were used to investigate the molecular basis of these effects, but no direct interactions could be demonstrated between α5β1 and either uPAR, uPA or uPA-uPAR complex. This suggests that assembly of these components on the plasma membrane is required to influence uPAR function, increasing uPAR-dependent pericellular proteolysis and decreasing uPARdependent cell adhesion. These interactions may be modified by other integrins, suggesting a complex interplay between uPAR and integrins on the cell surface with the potential to regulate invasive cell migration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bass, R","Ellis, V"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2777052,"sim:weight":0.282624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99391,"sim:weight":0.222737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.169383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.153894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.150389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.149663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929888,"sim:weight":0.149413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.149276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.14584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.138784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769017,"sim:weight":0.136332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.128768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.12817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.126356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.12302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585831,"sim:weight":0.120804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.11818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44075,"sim:weight":0.117637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387108,"sim:weight":0.115985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98669,"sim:weight":0.111738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The serine proteases have exquisitely sensitive regulatory mechanisms in this setting, involving both receptor-bound and transmembrane proteases. Receptor-bound proteases are exemplified by the uPA (urokinase plasminogen activator)/uPAR (uPAR receptor) plasminogen activation system. The mechanisms initiating the activity of this proteolytic system on the cell surface, a critical regulatory point, are poorly understood. We have found that the expression of the TTSP (type II transmembrane serine protease) matriptase is highly regulated in leucocytes, and correlates with the presence of active uPA on their surface. Using siRNA (small interfering RNA), we have demonstrated that matriptase specifically activates uPAR-associated pro-uPA. The uPA/uPAR system has been implicated in the activation of the plasminogen-related growth factor HGF (hepatocyte growth factor). However, we find no evidence for this, but instead that HGF can be activated by both matriptase and the related TTSP hepsin in purified systems. Hepsin is of particular interest, as the proteolytic cleavage sequence of HGF is an ‘ideal substrate’ for hepsin and membrane-associated hepsin activates HGF with high efficiency. Both of these TTSPs can be activated autocatalytically at the cell surface, an unusual mechanism among the serine proteases. Therefore these TTSPs have the capacity to be true upstream initiators of proteolytic activity with subsequent downstream effects on cell behaviour.","bibo:AuthorList":["Qiu, D","Owen, K","Gray, K","Bass, R","Ellis, V"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.295793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5230396,"sim:weight":0.243615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.223128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23815,"sim:weight":0.214796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931557,"sim:weight":0.211063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146199,"sim:weight":0.210083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.204278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709980,"sim:weight":0.203615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.203283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.199927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98535,"sim:weight":0.198621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.192316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773164,"sim:weight":0.188872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769017,"sim:weight":0.175132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98986,"sim:weight":0.174792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.174007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9538942,"sim:weight":0.172512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.16944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.167683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.163613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

How maspin mediates these diverse effects remains unclear, as it is devoid of protease inhibitory activity. We have previously shown that maspin rapidly inhibits the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), suggesting the involvement of direct interactions with cell surface proteins. Here, using immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that maspin binds specifically to the surface of VSMC in the dedifferentiated, but not the differentiated, phenotype. Ligand blotting of VSMC lysates revealed the presence of several maspin-binding proteins, with a protein of 150 kDa differentially expressed between the two VSMC phenotypes. Western blotting suggested that this protein was the β1 integrin subunit, and subsequently both α3β1 and α5β1, but not αvβ3, were shown to associate with maspin by coimmunoprecipitation. Specific binding of these integrins was also observed using maspin-affinity chromatography, using HT1080 cell lysates. Direct binding of maspin to α5β1 was confirmed using a recombinant α5β1-Fc fusion protein. Using conformation-dependent anti-β1 antibodies, maspin binding to VSMC was found to lead to a decrease in the activation status of the integrin. The functional involvement of α5β1 in mediating the effect of maspin was established by the inhibition of migration of CHO cells overexpressing human α5 integrin, but not those lacking α5 expression. Our observations suggest that maspin engages in specific interactions with a limited number of integrins on VSMC, leading to their inactivation, and that these interactions are responsible for the effects of maspin in the pericellular environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bass, R","Wagstaff, L","Ravenhill, L","Ellis, V"],"dc:date":"2009-10-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2779642,"sim:weight":0.500662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777050,"sim:weight":0.282624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The activating proteases are key components of its regulation, but controversy surrounds their identity. Using quantitative analysis we found no evidence for activation by uPA (urokinase plasminogen activator), despite reports that this is a principal activator of pro-HGF. This was unaffected by a wide range of experimental conditions, including the use of various molecular forms of both HGF and uPA, and the presence of uPAR (uPA receptor) or heparin. In contrast the catalytic domains of the TTSPs (type-II transmembrane serine proteases) matriptase and hepsin were highly efficient activators (50% activation at 0.1 and 3.4 nM respectively), at least four orders of magnitude more efficient than uPA. PS-SCL (positional-scanning synthetic combinatorial peptide libraries) were used to identify consensus sequences for the TTSPs, which in the case of hepsin corresponded to the pro-HGF activation sequence, demonstrating a high specificity for this reaction. Both TTSPs were also found to be efficient activators at the cell surface. Activation of pro-HGF by PC3 prostate carcinoma cells was abolished by both protease inhibition and matriptase-targeting siRNA (small interfering RNA), and scattering of MDCK (Madin–Darby canine kidney) cells in the presence of pro-HGF was abolished by inhibition of matriptase. Hepsin-transfected HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells also activated pro-HGF. These observations demonstrate that, in contrast with the uPA/uPAR system, the TTSPs matriptase and hepsin are direct pericellular activators of pro-HGF, and that together these proteins may form a pathway contributing to their involvement in pathological situations, including cancer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Owen, KA","Qiu, D","Alves, J","Schumacher, AM","Kilpatrick, LM","Li, J","Harris, JL","Ellis, V"],"dc:date":"2010-12-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is proposed to play a role in anaerobic respiration by mediating electron transfer to extracellular mineral oxides that can serve as terminal electron acceptors. The present work presents the first spectropotentiometric and voltammetric characterization of MtrC, using protein purified from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Potentiometric titrations, monitored by UV–vis absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, reveal that the hemes within MtrC titrate over a broad potential range spanning between approximately +100 and approximately −500 mV (vs. the standard hydrogen electrode). Across this potential window the UV–vis absorption spectra are characteristic of low-spin c-type hemes and the EPR spectra reveal broad, complex features that suggest the presence of magnetically spin-coupled low-spin c-hemes. Non-catalytic protein film voltammetry of MtrC demonstrates reversible electrochemistry over a potential window similar to that disclosed spectroscopically. The voltammetry also allows definition of kinetic properties of MtrC in direct electron exchange with a solid electrode surface and during reduction of a model Fe(III) substrate. Taken together, the data provide quantitative information on the potential domain in which MtrC can operate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hartshorne, RS","Jepson, BN","Clarke, TA","Field, SJ","Fredrickson, J","Zachara, J","Shi, L","Butt, JN","Richardson, DJ"],"dc:date":"2007-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2769050,"sim:weight":0.703607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780582,"sim:weight":0.651529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.505159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.40298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780581,"sim:weight":0.391999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205917,"sim:weight":0.368367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44440,"sim:weight":0.356713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4868971,"sim:weight":0.333501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.329786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113592,"sim:weight":0.322203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26064,"sim:weight":0.305215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2971,"sim:weight":0.303468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146021,"sim:weight":0.302616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381911,"sim:weight":0.290469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710562,"sim:weight":0.281871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769012,"sim:weight":0.281138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.279928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146046,"sim:weight":0.277298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890301,"sim:weight":0.275863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.273005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The X-ray crystal structure of Escherichia coli NrfB is presented at 1.74 Å (1 Å\u003d0.1 nm) resolution. The architecture of the protein is that of a 40 Å ‘nanowire’ in which the five haems are positioned within 6 Å of each other along a polypeptide scaffold. During nitrite reduction, the physiological role of NrfB is to mediate electron transfer to another pentahaem protein, NrfA, the enzyme that catalyses periplasmic nitrite or nitric oxide reduction.

Here, a novel octa-haem c protein, MccA, is described that contains only seven conventional haem c-binding motifs (CXXCH), in addition to several single cysteine residues and a conserved CH signature. Mass spectrometric analysis of purified MccA from Wolinella succinogenes suggests that two of the single cysteine residues are actually part of an unprecedented CX15CH sequence involved in haem c binding. Spectroscopic characterization of MccA identified an unusual high-potential haem c with a red-shifted absorption maximum, not unlike that of certain eukaryotic cytochromes c that exceptionally bind haem via only one thioether bridge. A haem lyase gene was found to be specifically required for the maturation of MccA in W. succinogenes. Equivalent haem lyase-encoding genes belonging to either the bacterial cytochrome c biogenesis system I or II are present in the vicinity of every known mccA gene suggesting a dedicated cytochrome c maturation pathway. The results necessitate reconsideration of computer-based prediction of putative haem c-binding motifs in bacterial proteomes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hartshorne, RS","Kern, M","Meyer, B","Clarke, TA","Karas, M","Richardson, DJ","Simon, J"],"dc:date":"2007-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98653,"sim:weight":0.469238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2781128,"sim:weight":0.435472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710562,"sim:weight":0.351506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.282425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.277889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.27667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777073,"sim:weight":0.25223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.235295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768022,"sim:weight":0.235157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.227732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772412,"sim:weight":0.226088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.221234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585857,"sim:weight":0.220277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85118,"sim:weight":0.219199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.208784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769012,"sim:weight":0.207758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.199595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.191812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.184353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99459,"sim:weight":0.184244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The molecular and cellular organization of the lens is well defined and consequently modifications associated with fibrosis can be clearly assessed. Moreover, the avascular and non-innervated properties of the lens allow effective in vitro studies to be employed that complement in vivo systems and relate to clinical data.

Ecological niche partitioning is a means of reducing direct competition between coexisting species and differences in habitat use among island gecko species have been suggested as a by-product of specialization to feeding on certain resources. Here, we examine modes and drivers of niche partitioning of two endemic species of Phelsuma gecko (Phelsuma sundbergi and Phelsuma astriata) in relict native palm forest in the Seychelles to further understanding of congeneric reptile co-existence in native habitats. Phelsuma abundance, microhabitat use and habitat composition were quantified in different macrohabitat types. P. sundbergi showed a clear preference for habitat dominated by the coco de mer palm, Lodoicea maldivica and a strong association with male individuals of this dioecious species. P. astriata density increased significantly with arboreal biodiversity but did not display a relationship with a specific tree type. High levels of resource segregation were determined along the microhabitat axis, based on differential tree preference. Our results suggest that P. sundbergi and P. astriata may have evolved to co-exist in this habitat type through partitioning of microhabitat as members of a divergent specialist/generalist assemblage determined by consumption of L. maldivica pollen by P. sundbergi. Our findings concur with the hypothesis that differences in habitat use among island reptiles are a by-product of trophic specialization and support the conservation of native habitat for maintenance of reptile diversity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Noble, T","Bunbury, N","Kaiser-Bunbury, CN","Bell, DJ"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is unknown to what extent the programs that regulate neural crest development interact with mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which is the most commonly mutated gene in human melanoma1. We have used zebrafish embryos to identify the initiating transcriptional events that occur on activation of human BRAF(V600E) (which encodes an amino acid substitution mutant of BRAF) in the neural crest lineage. Zebrafish embryos that are transgenic for mitfa:BRAF(V600E) and lack p53 (also known as tp53) have a gene signature that is enriched for markers of multipotent neural crest cells, and neural crest progenitors from these embryos fail to terminally differentiate. To determine whether these early transcriptional events are important for melanoma pathogenesis, we performed a chemical genetic screen to identify small-molecule suppressors of the neural crest lineage, which were then tested for their effects on melanoma. One class of compound, inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), for example leflunomide, led to an almost complete abrogation of neural crest development in zebrafish and to a reduction in the self-renewal of mammalian neural crest stem cells. Leflunomide exerts these effects by inhibiting the transcriptional elongation of genes that are required for neural crest development and melanoma growth. When used alone or in combination with a specific inhibitor of the BRAF(V600E) oncogene, DHODH inhibition led to a marked decrease in melanoma growth both in vitro and in mouse xenograft studies. Taken together, these studies highlight developmental pathways in neural crest cells that have a direct bearing on melanoma formation.","bibo:AuthorList":["White, RM","Cech, J","Ratanasirintrawoot, S","Lin, CY","Rahl, PB","Burke, CJ","Langdon, E","Tomlinson, ML","Mosher, J","Kaufman, C","Chen, F","Long, HK","Kramer, M","Datta, S","Neuberg, D","Granter, S","Young, RA","Morrison, S","Wheeler, GN","Zon, LI"],"dc:date":"2011-03-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Snow is known to influence boundary layer air on a local scale, and given the large global surface coverage of snow may also be significant on regional and global scales. We present a new detailed one-dimensional snow chemistry module that has been coupled to the 1-D atmospheric boundary layer model MISTRA. The new 1-D snow module, which is dynamically coupled to the overlaying atmospheric model, includes heat transport in the snowpack, molecular diffusion, and wind pumping of gases in the interstitial air. The model includes gas phase chemical reactions both in the interstitial air and the atmosphere. Heterogeneous and multiphase chemistry on atmospheric aerosol is considered explicitly. The chemical interaction of interstitial air with snow grains is simulated assuming chemistry in a liquid-like layer (LLL) on the grain surface. The coupled model, referred to as MISTRA-SNOW, was used to investigate snow as the source of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and gas phase reactive bromine in the atmospheric boundary layer in the remote snow covered Arctic (over the Greenland ice sheet) as well as to investigate the link between halogen cycling and ozone depletion that has been observed in interstitial air. The model is validated using data taken 10 June–13 June, 2008 as part of the Greenland Summit Halogen-HOx experiment (GSHOX). The model predicts that reactions involving bromide and nitrate impurities in the surface snow can sustain atmospheric NO and BrO mixing ratios measured at Summit, Greenland during this period.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thomas, JL","Stutz, J","Lefer, B","Huey, LG","Toyota, K","Dibb, JE","von Glasow, R"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":851310,"sim:weight":0.688007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":487080,"sim:weight":0.567307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":687802,"sim:weight":0.461026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1016656,"sim:weight":0.429042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1054040,"sim:weight":0.391783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":487070,"sim:weight":0.284641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is widely thought to support a rapid dispersal of maternal lineages from Taiwan ~4000 years ago (4 ka), but the chronological resolution of existing control-region data is poor, and an East Indonesian origin has also been proposed. By analyzing 157 complete mtDNA genomes, we show that the motif itself most likely originated \u003e6 ka in the vicinity of the Bismarck Archipelago, and its immediate ancestor is \u003e8 ka old and virtually restricted to Near Oceania. This indicates that Polynesian maternal lineages from Island Southeast Asia gained a foothold in Near Oceania much earlier than dispersal from either Taiwan or Indonesia 3-4 ka would predict. However, we find evidence in minor lineages for more recent two-way maternal gene flow between Island Southeast Asia and Near Oceania, likely reflecting movements along a \"voyaging corridor\" between them, as previously proposed on archaeological grounds. Small-scale mid-Holocene movements from Island Southeast Asia likely transmitted Austronesian languages to the long-established Southeast Asian colonies in the Bismarcks carrying the Polynesian motif, perhaps also providing the impetus for the expansion into Polynesia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Soares, P","Rito, T","Trejaut, J","Mormina, M","Hill, C","Tinkler-Hundal, E","Braid, M","Clarke, DJ","Loo, JH","Thomson, N","Denham, T","Donohue, M","Macaulay, V","Lin, M","Oppenheimer, S","Richards, MB"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2777515,"sim:weight":0.719857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777514,"sim:weight":0.666796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777511,"sim:weight":0.470564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777516,"sim:weight":0.425173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777512,"sim:weight":0.388926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.331927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108609,"sim:weight":0.294487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.293988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43702,"sim:weight":0.293811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.290773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.260079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.260079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.255711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.25183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.248524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.247575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.241571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.241571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62357,"sim:weight":0.240832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.226465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Despite considerable research on the Polynesian motif in Oceania, there has been little equivalent work on the western edge of its expansion - leaving major issues unresolved regarding the motif\u0027s evolutionary history. This has also led to considerable uncertainty regarding the settlement of Madagascar. In this study, we assess mtDNA variation in 266 individuals from three Malagasy ethnic groups: the Mikea, Vezo, and Merina. Complete mtDNA genome sequencing reveals a new variant of the Polynesian motif in Madagascar; two coding region mutations define a Malagasy-specific sub-branch. This newly defined \u0027Malagasy motif\u0027 occurs at high frequency in all three ethnic groups (13-50%), and its phylogenetic position, geographic distribution, and estimated age all support a recent origin, but without conclusively identifying a specific source region. Nevertheless, the haplotype\u0027s limited diversity, similar to those of other mtDNA haplogroups found in our Malagasy groups, best supports a small number of initial settlers arriving to Madagascar through the same migratory process. Finally, the discovery of this lineage provides a set of new polymorphic positions to help localize the Austronesian ancestors of the Malagasy, as well as uncover the origin and evolution of the Polynesian motif itself.","bibo:AuthorList":["Razafindrazaka, H","Ricaut, FX","Cox, MP","Mormina, M","Dugoujon, JM","Randriamarolaza, LP","Guitard, E","Tonasso, L","Ludes, B","Crubézy, E"],"dc:date":"2010-05-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2777510,"sim:weight":0.470564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777514,"sim:weight":0.430536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777515,"sim:weight":0.406716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81444,"sim:weight":0.351768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384635,"sim:weight":0.27305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11157,"sim:weight":0.256232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85626,"sim:weight":0.254898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.250461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.247543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.242701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.242701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.239891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381434,"sim:weight":0.23744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52008,"sim:weight":0.235272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.235175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.231499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46554,"sim:weight":0.229437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.228497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9541378,"sim:weight":0.224631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.220138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Furthermore, as several authors have pointed out recently, linear molecular clocks that incorporate selectable characters are in any case problematic. We here confirm a modest effect of purifying selection on the mtDNA coding region and propose an improved molecular clock for dating human mtDNA, based on a worldwide phylogeny of \u003e 2000 complete mtDNA genomes and calibrating against recent evidence for the divergence time of humans and chimpanzees. We focus on a time-dependent mutation rate based on the entire mtDNA genome and supported by a neutral clock based on synonymous mutations alone. We show that the corrected rate is further corroborated by archaeological dating for the settlement of the Canary Islands and Remote Oceania and also, given certain phylogeographic assumptions, by the timing of the first modern human settlement of Europe and resettlement after the Last Glacial Maximum. The corrected rate yields an age of modern human expansion in the Americas at approximately 15 kya that-unlike the uncorrected clock-matches the archaeological evidence, but continues to indicate an out-of-Africa dispersal at around 55-70 kya, 5-20 ky before any clear archaeological record, suggesting the need for archaeological research efforts focusing on this time window. We also present improved rates for the mtDNA control region, and the first comprehensive estimates of positional mutation rates for human mtDNA, which are essential for defining mutation models in phylogenetic analyses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Soares, P","Ermini, L","Thomson, N","Mormina, M","Rito, T","Röhl, A","Salas, A","Oppenheimer, S","Macaulay, V","Richards, MB"],"dc:date":"2009-06-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108618,"sim:weight":0.0507275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Largely because of the influence of linguistic studies, however, which have a shallow time depth, the attention of archaeologists and geneticists has usually been focused on the last 6,000 years--in particular, on a proposed Neolithic dispersal from China and Taiwan. Here we use complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome sequencing to spotlight some earlier processes that clearly had a major role in the demographic history of the region but have hitherto been unrecognized. We show that haplogroup E, an important component of mtDNA diversity in the region, evolved in situ over the last 35,000 years and expanded dramatically throughout ISEA around the beginning of the Holocene, at the time when the ancient continent of Sundaland was being broken up into the present-day archipelago by rising sea levels. It reached Taiwan and Near Oceania more recently, within the last approximately 8,000 years. This suggests that global warming and sea-level rises at the end of the Ice Age, 15,000-7,000 years ago, were the main forces shaping modern human diversity in the region.","bibo:AuthorList":["Soares, P","Trejaut, JA","Loo, JH","Hill, C","Mormina, M","Lee, CL","Chen, YM","Hudjashov, G","Forster, P","Macaulay, V","Bulbeck, D","Oppenheimer, S","Lin, M","Richards, MB"],"dc:date":"2008-03-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2777515,"sim:weight":0.801675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777510,"sim:weight":0.666796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777511,"sim:weight":0.430536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81444,"sim:weight":0.415993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.330116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631478,"sim:weight":0.327109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.294494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108609,"sim:weight":0.287931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.284466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90566,"sim:weight":0.259774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4485053,"sim:weight":0.254606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109092,"sim:weight":0.25136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384958,"sim:weight":0.247972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.246032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.237185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.237185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77137,"sim:weight":0.230747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.22758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225432,"sim:weight":0.225593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225626,"sim:weight":0.220986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is widely held, in both archaeology and linguistics, that they are largely descended from a second wave of dispersal, proto-Austronesian-speaking agriculturalists who originated in China and spread to Taiwan approximately 5,500 years ago. From there, they are thought to have dispersed into ISEA approximately 4,000 years ago, assimilating the indigenous populations. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial DNA diversity in the region is extremely high and includes a large number of indigenous clades. Only a fraction of these date back to the time of first settlement, and the majority appear to mark dispersals in the late-Pleistocene or early-Holocene epoch most likely triggered by postglacial flooding. There are much closer genetic links to Taiwan than to the mainland, but most of these probably predated the mid-Holocene \"Out of Taiwan\" event as traditionally envisioned. Only approximately 20% at most of modern mitochondrial DNAs in ISEA could be linked to such an event, suggesting that, if an agriculturalist migration did take place, it was demographically minor, at least with regard to the involvement of women.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hill, C","Soares, P","Mormina, M","Macaulay, V","Clarke, D","Blumbach, PB","Vizuete-Forster, M","Forster, P","Bulbeck, D","Oppenheimer, S","Richards, M"],"dc:date":"2007-11-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2777514,"sim:weight":0.801675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777510,"sim:weight":0.719857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777516,"sim:weight":0.52748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998668,"sim:weight":0.434084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777511,"sim:weight":0.406716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5849830,"sim:weight":0.403001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777512,"sim:weight":0.38998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81444,"sim:weight":0.362071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1438838,"sim:weight":0.35646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5731973,"sim:weight":0.330704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.308283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108609,"sim:weight":0.306037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.29908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.298448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.296856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631478,"sim:weight":0.274033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.268885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65999,"sim:weight":0.266358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90566,"sim:weight":0.257058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109092,"sim:weight":0.253908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We have analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNAs) control-region and coding-region markers in 447 mtDNAs from the region, including 260 Orang Asli, representative of each of the traditional groupings, the Semang, the Senoi, and the Aboriginal Malays, allowing us to test hypotheses about their origins. All of the Orang Asli groups have undergone high levels of genetic drift, but phylogeographic traces nevertheless remain of the ancestry of their maternal lineages. The Semang have a deep ancestry within the Malay Peninsula, dating to the initial settlement from Africa \u003e50,000 years ago. The Senoi appear to be a composite group, with approximately half of the maternal lineages tracing back to the ancestors of the Semang and about half to Indochina. This is in agreement with the suggestion that they represent the descendants of early Austroasiatic speaking agriculturalists, who brought both their language and their technology to the southern part of the peninsula approximately 4,000 years ago and coalesced with the indigenous population. The Aboriginal Malays are more diverse, and although they show some connections with island Southeast Asia, as expected, they also harbor haplogroups that are either novel or rare elsewhere. Contrary to expectations, complete mtDNA genome sequences from one of these, R9b, suggest an ancestry in Indochina around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, followed by an early-Holocene dispersal through the Malay Peninsula into island Southeast Asia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hill, C","Soares, P","Mormina, M","Macaulay, V","Meehan, W","Blackburn, J","Clarke, D","Raja, JM","Ismail, P","Bulbeck, D","Oppenheimer, S","Richards, M"],"dc:date":"2006-09-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2777515,"sim:weight":0.52748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777510,"sim:weight":0.425173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Release of IL-8 induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Changes in expression of inhibitory kappa B (IkappaB) were monitored by Western blotting and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) was determined in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSAs). TNF-alpha induced release of IL-8 was inhibited by WIN55212-2 which also blocked the degradation of IkappaB-alpha and activation of NF-kappaB induced by TNF-alpha. These data provide strong evidence that WIN55212-2 may modulate IL-8 release by negatively regulating the signaling cascade leading to the activation of NF-kappaB. These findings highlight a potential mechanism for the immunomodulatory properties of cannabinoids and contribute towards acquiring a clear understanding of the role of cannabinoids in inflammation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mormina, M","Thakur, S","Molleman, A","Whelan, CJ","Baydoun, AR"],"dc:date":"2006-05-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99258,"sim:weight":0.443053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146196,"sim:weight":0.439206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387403,"sim:weight":0.405255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.378251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75980,"sim:weight":0.376209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222897,"sim:weight":0.359657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632033,"sim:weight":0.353301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76007,"sim:weight":0.341135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631895,"sim:weight":0.337688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.329656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.326551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585897,"sim:weight":0.324787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631669,"sim:weight":0.314779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.312932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.311288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222903,"sim:weight":0.308991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98707,"sim:weight":0.308629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.307948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.30277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.302651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It impacts not just on the health but also the wider lives of those misusing substances, their families, their colleagues and wider society. Those who misuse substances will inevitably at some stage be seen by doctors, who therefore have a vital role to play, in recognising substance misuse, and in assessing and managing the associated problems. This applies equally to hospital doctors and general practitioners, as much as to specialists in addiction; because all these staff will encounter substance misuse every day.\r\nPart of the government’s response to this problem is to address the education of professionals who will deal with substance misuse.

This approach exploited the unique matching of twins to provide an estimate of an association that was not confounded by age, genetic background, or shared lifestyle. \r\n\r\nResults: In \u003e2000 postmenopausal women (BMD data on 1019, 1218, and 1232 twin pairs at the hip neck, hip, and spine, respectively), we observed a positive association between alcohol intake (from wine but not from beer or spirits) and spine BMD (P \u003d 0.01) and a negative association with a traditional 20th-century English diet at the hip neck (P \u003d 0.01). Both associations remained borderline significant after adjustment for mean twin-pair intakes (P \u003d 0.04 and P \u003d 0.055, respectively). Other dietary patterns and intakes of calcium, vitamin D, and protein were unrelated to BMD. \r\n\r\nConclusion: Our results showed that diet has an independent but subtle effect on BMD; wine intake was positively associated with spine BMD, whereas a traditional (20th-century) English diet had a negative association with hip BMD.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fairweather-Tait, SJ","Skinner, J","Guile, G","Cassidy, A","Spector, TD","Macgregor, AJ"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":177273,"sim:weight":0.116806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper goes some way to redressing this imbalance by analysing observed daily maximum gust speeds from a 43-station network over the period 1980–2005. Complementing these data are dynamically downscaled reanalysis data, generated using the PRECIS Regional Climate Modelling system, for the period 1959–2001. Inter-annual variations in both the observed and downscaled reanalysis gust speeds are presented, with a statistically significant (at the 95% confidence interval) 5% increase across the network in daily maximum gust speeds between 1959 and the early 1990s, followed by an apparent decrease. The benefit of incorporating dynamically downscaled reanalysis data is revealed by the fact that the decrease in gust speeds since 1993 may be placed in the context of a very slight increase displayed over the longer 1959–2001 period. Furthermore, the severity of individual windstorm events is considered, with high profile recent events placed into the context of the long term record. A daily cycle is identified from the station observations in the timing of the daily maximum gust speeds, with an afternoon peak occurring between 12:00–15:00, exhibiting spatial and intra-annual variations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hewston, R","Dorling, S"],"dc:date":"2011-07-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":30703,"sim:weight":0.395225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761095,"sim:weight":0.364139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.359434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.359433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.352178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.327142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75780,"sim:weight":0.310561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26258,"sim:weight":0.309493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.306452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.302564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30278,"sim:weight":0.302294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.301513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.299795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.29856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186392,"sim:weight":0.280738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.277493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495076,"sim:weight":0.270837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771227,"sim:weight":0.265672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75564,"sim:weight":0.235773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.228232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This literature, in common with much research on the public communication of science and technology (PCST), lacks consistency or indeed clear definitions of what is meant by ‘social science’, ‘natural science’ and indeed, ‘science’. Analyses of social science media coverage indicate that the social sciences are communicated in some quite different patterns from those seen with natural science research. Some authors have suggested that this may be due to the overlap between the subject matter of social science research (people), and experiential, ‘common sense’ knowledge. Other relevant literature, on ‘self-help’ psychology books, public intellectuals, and social scientists as expert witnesses. \r\nThere is an urgent need for more consistent, systematic research addressing PCSS, in order to understand better the general issues involved in communicating expertise and those faced specifically by the social sciences.  Researchers in PCST should reflect on these issues in order to address reflexively how we communicate publicly about our field, just as we seek to advise other researchers on how best to communicate in the public domain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cassidy, A","Bucchi, M","Trench, B"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A key feature has been the presence of two opposing framings: the ‘good badger’ as epitomised in Kenneth Grahame’s 1908 children’s novel ‘The Wind in the Willows’; and the less familiar ‘bad badger’: carnivore, digger, and carrier of disease.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cassidy, A"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108327,"sim:weight":0.265453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.262539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.250597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44084,"sim:weight":0.250303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43801,"sim:weight":0.246372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.245344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.24425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.240392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.239979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.236321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.2277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.2277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.224781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.223947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43223,"sim:weight":0.223538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382037,"sim:weight":0.221872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.221178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383319,"sim:weight":0.218527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.218155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46981,"sim:weight":0.216121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The module focuses specifically on science communication and aims to bring an understanding of how science is disseminated to the public. Students on the module are made aware of the models surrounding science communication and investigate how the science culture interfaces with the public. During the module they learn how to adapt science concepts for different audiences and how to talk confidently about science to a lay-audience. Student motivation for module choice centres on the acquisition of transferable skills and students develop these skills through designing, running and evaluating a public outreach event at a school or in a public area. These transferable skills acquired include communication, interaction with different organisations such as museums and science centres, developing understanding of both the needs of different audiences and the importance of time management. They also develop skills relating to self-reflection and how to use this as a tool for future self development. The majority of students completing the module go on to further study, either a PhD, MSc or teacher training. The module can be sustained in its present formed if capped at 40 students, however it is recognised that to increase cohort size, further investment of faculty time and resources would be required.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yeoman, KH","James, HA","Bowater, L"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The two major endoparasitic groups of parasitic platyhelminths, cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes), typically have high fecundity, infect more than one host species, and transmit trophically. Monogeneans are parasitic flatworms that are among the most host specific of all parasites. Most are ectoparasites with relatively low fecundity and direct life cycles tied to water. They infect a single host species, usually a fish, although some are endoparasites of amphibians and aquatic chelonian reptiles. Monogenean eggs have strong shells and mostly release ciliated larvae, which, against all odds, must find, identify, and infect a suitable specific host. Some monogeneans increase their chances of finding a host by greatly extending the hatching period (possible bet-hedging). Others respond to cues for hatching such as shadows, chemicals, mechanical disturbance, and osmotic changes, most of which may be generated by the host. Hatching may be rhythmical, larvae emerging at times when the host is more vulnerable to invasion, and this may be combined with responses to other environmental cues. Different monogenean species that infect the same host species may adopt different strategies of hatching, indicating that tactics may be more complex than first thought. Control of egg assembly and egg-laying, possibly by host hormones, has permitted colonization of frogs and toads by polystomatid monogeneans. Some monogeneans further improve the chances of infection by attaching eggs to the host or by retaining eggs on, or in, the body of the parasite. The latter adaptation has led ultimately to viviparity in gyrodactylid monogeneans.","bibo:AuthorList":["Whittington, ID","Kearn, GC"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43577,"sim:weight":0.3163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26380,"sim:weight":0.236641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.235879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.222332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.219344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.216843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.215934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.215767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.215766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.214806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.213043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62149,"sim:weight":0.21079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29767,"sim:weight":0.206895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.206726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108177,"sim:weight":0.204204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.202887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.201888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890345,"sim:weight":0.201384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97721,"sim:weight":0.200693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43513,"sim:weight":0.198844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There are also insufficient data to provide firm evidence that the percentage of cases arising de novo is greater in the UK and the Western world as compared to the Indian subcontinent. Screening for oral cancer by visual examination is simple, inexpensive and causes little discomfort; however, there is no evidence for the effectiveness of screening for oral cancer either in reducing mortality from the disease or in reducing the incidence of invasive disease by detection and treatment of precancerous lesions. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend population screening for oral cancer in the UK.

This study aimed to\r\nidentify factors inhibiting the implementation and integration of telecare systems for chronic disease management in the community.\r\n\r\nMethods: Large scale comparative study employing qualitative data collection techniques: semi-structured\r\ninterviews with key informants, task-groups, and workshops; framework analysis of qualitative data informed by\r\nNormalization Process Theory. Drawn from telecare services in community and domestic settings in England and\r\nScotland, 221 participants were included, consisting of health professionals and managers; patients and carers;\r\nsocial care professionals and managers; and service suppliers and manufacturers.\r\n\r\nResults: Key barriers to telecare integration were uncertainties about coherent and sustainable service and\r\nbusiness models; lack of coordination across social and primary care boundaries, lack of financial or other\r\nincentives to include telecare within primary care services; a lack of a sense of continuity with previous service provision and self-care work undertaken by patients; and general uncertainty about the adequacy of telecare systems. These problems led to poor integration of policy and practice.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Telecare services may offer a cost effective and safe form of care for some people living with chronic\r\nillness. Slow and uneven implementation and integration do not stem from problems of adoption. They result\r\nfrom incomplete understanding of the role of telecare systems and subsequent adaption and embeddedness to\r\ncontext, and uncertainties about the best way to develop, coordinate, and sustain services that assist with chronic\r\ndisease management. Interventions are therefore needed that (i) reduce uncertainty about the ownership of\r\nimplementation processes and that lock together health and social care agencies; and (ii) ensure user centred\r\nrather than biomedical/service-centred models of care.","bibo:AuthorList":["May, C","Finch, T","Cornford, James","Exley, C","Gately, C","Kirk, S","Jenkings, N","Mair, F","Osborne, J","Robinson, L","Rogers, A","Wilson, R"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.480001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43411,"sim:weight":0.44333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.427802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341217,"sim:weight":0.423965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.419663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.419391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.414036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.407389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.39658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145923,"sim:weight":0.385681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.385498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.385498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.385498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.385498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.385498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.385498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.385498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.385498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.385498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.385498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While landscape context and habitat quality are known to influence species richness and abundance of bees, there is a lack of evidence from manipulative field experiments on bees\u0027 responses to adaptive management across differently structured landscapes. We present the results of a large-scale study that investigated the effects of a targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) on bumble bees (Bombus spp.) over three years in the United Kingdom. Forage patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist. These findings serve to strengthen the evidence base for extending agri-environment schemes to boost declining pollinator populations to a larger number of agricultural landscapes across the globe.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carvell, C","Osborne, JL","Bourke, AFG","Freeman, SN","Pywell, RF","Heard, MS"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

To address these, we define what we understand by independence, and in particular formal independence from politics. Using new data gathered from 175 IRAs world-\r\nwide, we model formal independence as a latent trait.

PAS domains are often dimeric and act as versatile sensory and interaction modules to propagate environmental signals to effector domains. The NifL regulatory protein from Azotobacter vinelandii senses the oxygen status of the cell via an FAD cofactor accommodated within the first of two amino-terminal tandem PAS domains, termed PAS1 and PAS2. The redox signal perceived at PAS1 is relayed to PAS2 resulting in conformational reorganization of NifL and consequent inhibition of NifA activity. We have identified mutations in the cofactor-binding cavity of PAS1 that prevent \u0027release\u0027 of the inhibitory signal upon oxidation of FAD. Substitutions of conserved β-sheet residues on the distal surface of the FAD-binding cavity trap PAS1 in the inhibitory signalling state, irrespective of the redox state of the FAD group. In contrast, substitutions within the flanking A\u0027α-helix that comprises part of the dimerization interface of PAS1 prevent transmission of the inhibitory signal. Taken together, these results suggest an inter-subunit pathway for redox signal transmission from PAS1 that propagates from core to the surface in a conformation-dependent manner requiring a flexible dimer interface.","bibo:AuthorList":["Little, R","Salinas, P","Slavny, P","Clarke, TA","Dixon, R"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2769012,"sim:weight":0.733503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185139,"sim:weight":0.426701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26920,"sim:weight":0.417521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.406763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47262,"sim:weight":0.392478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.384093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199825,"sim:weight":0.355429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.350637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585857,"sim:weight":0.348222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768022,"sim:weight":0.344989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.343365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.332062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.330882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709941,"sim:weight":0.325473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.322781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779642,"sim:weight":0.315208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.30856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.30337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.299304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.298729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Overall, the pattern of results was not consistent with the hypothesis that interpretation bias plays a role in the development of anxiety.

In contrast, the preschoolers with WS were significantly more willing than either control group to engage with a stranger, even when the stranger’s face could not be seen. \r\nConclusion\r\nThe findings challenge the hypothesis that an unusual attraction to the face directly motivates social approach behaviour in individuals with WS.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dodd, Helen","Porter, Melanie","Peters, Gemma","Rapee, Ronald"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":87201,"sim:weight":0.302622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.287863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387078,"sim:weight":0.279333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.277524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763966,"sim:weight":0.273839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108868,"sim:weight":0.273631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101445,"sim:weight":0.267294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710589,"sim:weight":0.266716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.262661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101357,"sim:weight":0.261092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.260439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.251363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.250098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154825,"sim:weight":0.249974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.249908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.244144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23711,"sim:weight":0.242711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101416,"sim:weight":0.241806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.23908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914780,"sim:weight":0.237124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Participants were aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 5 months, 101 were male. A thorough methodology was used that incorporated data from multiple observations of behaviour, diagnostic interviews and questionnaire measures.  The results showed that children categorised as behaviourally inhibited were significantly more likely to meet criteria for a range of anxiety diagnoses. Furthermore, a wide range of family environment factors, including maternal anxiety, parenting and attachment were significantly associated with BI, with inhibited children more likely to experience adverse family environment factors. No interactions between temperament and family environment were found for child anxiety. However, a significant relationship between current maternal anxiety and child anxiety was found consistently even after controlling for BI. Additionally, there was some evidence of a relationship between maternal negativity and child anxiety, after controlling for BI. The results may suggest that temperament and family environment operate as additive, rather than interactive risk factors for child anxiety. This is discussed in the context of theoretical models of child anxiety and directions for future research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hudson, Jennifer","Dodd, Helen","Bovopoulos , Nataly"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2673232,"sim:weight":0.153776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We explain why these responses cannot close the evidence gap, and focus on the risk of biased results from open (unblinded) pragmatic trials. These are clinical trials which compare a treatment with \u0027usual care\u0027 or no additional care. Their risk of bias has been overlooked because the components of outcome measurements have not been taken into account. The components of an outcome measure are the specific effect of the intervention and non-specific effects such as true placebo effects, cognitive measurement biases, and other effects (which tend to cancel out when similar groups are compared). Negative true placebo effects (\u0027frustrebo effects\u0027) in the comparison group, and cognitive measurement biases in the comparison group and the experimental group make the non-specific effect look like a benefit for the intervention group. However, the clinical importance of these effects is often dismissed or ignored without justification. The bottom line is that, for results from open pragmatic trials to be trusted, research is required to measure the clinical importance of true placebo effects, cognitive bias effects, and specific effects of treatments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hopayian, K"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24815,"sim:weight":0.465061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8337,"sim:weight":0.441485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229643,"sim:weight":0.419901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.364153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.337536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.331864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.327207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47226,"sim:weight":0.323882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.321761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.318565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.318565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145923,"sim:weight":0.318105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543911,"sim:weight":0.312865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.310977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.310977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.310977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.310977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.310977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.310977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.310977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A systematic review was conducted of any study type that reported extractable data relevant to diagnosis. The search included all studies up to 1 March 2008 in four databases: AMED, CINAHL, Embase and Medline. Screening, data extraction and analysis were all performed independently by two reviewers. A total of 55 studies were included: 51 individual and 3 aggregated data studies, and 1 combined study. The most common features found were: buttock pain, external tenderness over the greater sciatic notch, aggravation of the pain through sitting and augmentation of the pain with manoeuvres that increase piriformis muscle tension.

High levels of local adaptation may constrain expansion into new locations, while the relative fitness of dispersing individuals will influence subsequent population growth. However, opportunities to explore such processes are rare, particularly at scales relevant to species-based conservation strategies. Icelandic black-tailed godwits, Limosa limosa islandica, have expanded their range throughout Iceland over the last century. We show that current male morphology varies strongly in relation to the timing of colonization across Iceland, with small males being absent from recently occupied areas. Smaller males are also proportionately more abundant on habitats and sites with higher breeding success and relative abundance of females. This population-wide spatial structuring of male morphology is most likely to result from female preferences for small males and better-quality habitats increasing both small-male fitness and the dispersal probability of larger males into poorer-quality habitats. Such eco-evolutionary feedbacks may be a key driver of rates of population growth and range expansion and contraction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gunnarsson, TG","Sutherland, WJ","Alves, JA","Potts, PM","Gill, JA"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2761111,"sim:weight":0.445648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43540,"sim:weight":0.363225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387066,"sim:weight":0.35664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43370,"sim:weight":0.352102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62510,"sim:weight":0.351732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108770,"sim:weight":0.337671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108684,"sim:weight":0.336689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764132,"sim:weight":0.324843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.308514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.300646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57891,"sim:weight":0.290646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.282157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.276222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.276219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62227,"sim:weight":0.271668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585979,"sim:weight":0.27113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.269887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.265934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97600,"sim:weight":0.262105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":114129,"sim:weight":0.251238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Effects of sewage discharges on estuarine invertebrates and birds","bibo:abstract":"Human communities often discharge wastewaters into estuaries, influencing their organic and pollutant loading, benthic community and trophic structure. The implementation of the Water Framework Directive has encouraged the treatment of wastewater discharges across European estuaries, but the implications for invertebrate and waterbird communities are poorly understood. We explore the effects of untreated sewage discharges on the distribution and abundance of foraging black-tailed godwits Limosa limosa and their main benthic prey (bivalves and polychaetes) on the Tejo estuary in Portugal, a major European Special Protection Area with ongoing wastewater improvements. Patches of mudflat in close proximity to sewage streams (\u003c30 m) can support polychaete densities and biomass that are an order of magnitude higher than more distant sites (\u003e70 m), and godwits foraging in these areas can attain the highest intake rates recorded for the estuary. However, high intake rates can also be attained on bivalve prey, and bivalve biomass and density increase slightly with distance from sewage streams. As the organic input from sewage outfalls influences invertebrate abundance and godwit foraging rates over relatively small areas, the ongoing implementation of a sewage treatment network on the Tejo estuary seems likely to have only a limited impact on the wintering godwit population. The localized effect of untreated sewage discharges on benthic communities suggests that the implications for predatory birds are relatively minor where alternative prey are available, but may be more severe in locations with more depauperate, polychaete-dominated invertebrate communities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alves, JA","Sutherland, WJ","Gill, JA"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Three cycles of planning, acting,observing and reflecting were designed to evaluate practice and implement change in this interactive setting, calling for specific and distinct collaborations.\r\nData collection includes: observing educational interactions; administering patient evaluation questionnaires; interviewing healthcare staff, patients\r\nand carers; patient and carer focus groups; and examining written and audiovisual educational materials. The study revolves around and depends on multi-dimensional collaborations. Reflecting on these collaborations highlights the diversity of perspectives held by all those engaged in the study and enhances the action research lessons. Successfully maintaining the collaborations\r\nrecognises the need for negotiation, inclusivity, comprehension, brokerage,and problem-solving. Managing the potential tensions is crucial to the successful implementation of changes introduced to practice and thus has important implications for patients’ well-being.

It exemplifies the challenges of the collaborative action research process and examines how both researchers and practitioners might reflect on the translation of theory into educational\r\npractices within a hospital colorectal department.

Until now the role for BaeSR in both the Salmonella Typhimurium response to stress and its contribution to infection have not been fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate stationary phase growth, iron and sodium tungstate as novel inducers of the BaeRregulon, with BaeR critically required for Salmonella resistance to sodium tungstate. We show that functional overlap between the resistance nodulation-cell division (RND) multidrug transporters, MdtA, AcrD and AcrB exists for the waste disposal of tungstate from the cell. We also point to a role for enterobactinsiderophores in the protection of enteric organisms from tungstate, akin to the scenario in nitrogen fixing bacteria. Surprisingly, BaeR is the first envelope stress response pathway investigated in S. Typhimurium that is not required for murine typhoid in either ityS or ityR mouse backgrounds. BaeR is therefore either required for survival in larger mammals such as pigs or calves, an avian host such as chickens, or survival out with the host altogether where Salmonella and related enterics must survive in soil and water.","bibo:AuthorList":["Appia-Ayme, C","Patrick, EJ","Sullivan, M","Alston, MJ","Field, SJ","AbuOun, M","Anjum, MF","Rowley, G"],"dc:date":"2011-08-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2781930,"sim:weight":0.431264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76202,"sim:weight":0.23792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44537,"sim:weight":0.226074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.225993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222850,"sim:weight":0.224484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768022,"sim:weight":0.213067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45241,"sim:weight":0.212718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826716,"sim:weight":0.208553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75835,"sim:weight":0.206429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.203698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76737,"sim:weight":0.195285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99353,"sim:weight":0.191194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76816,"sim:weight":0.189294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777895,"sim:weight":0.179393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.175668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99459,"sim:weight":0.17204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.170569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778837,"sim:weight":0.17,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77076,"sim:weight":0.169619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222853,"sim:weight":0.167802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Dolowitz and Marsh Revisited","bibo:abstract":"Over the last decade, policy transfer has emerged as an important concept within public policy analysis, guiding both theoretical and empirical research spanning many venues and issue areas. Using Dolowitz and Marsh\u0027s 1996 stocktake as its starting point, this article reviews what has been learned by whom and for what purpose. It finds that the literature has evolved from its rather narrow, state-centred roots to cover many more actors and venues. While policy transfer still represents a niche topic for some researchers, an increasing number have successfully assimilated it into wider debates on topics such as globalisation, Europeanisation and policy innovation. This article assesses the concept\u0027s position in the overall ‘tool-kit’ of policy analysis, examines some possible future directions and reflects on their associated risks and opportunities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Benson, D","Jordan, A"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43534,"sim:weight":0.483159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709929,"sim:weight":0.469687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76300,"sim:weight":0.399209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.392709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631884,"sim:weight":0.369238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.32968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43188,"sim:weight":0.329033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145598,"sim:weight":0.319416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.316695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631263,"sim:weight":0.310851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.308973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.308973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.308973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.308973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.308973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.308973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.308973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.308973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.308973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.308973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In nearly all these reports, the full-length Ets-1 (p51) is commonly considered to be the active form and the role of the Ets-1ΔVII splice variant (p42) has not been addressed. Therefore, we studied the functional effects of p42 Ets-1 in comparison to p51 Ets-1 expression in a well-characterized mouse fibroblast cell line. Furthermore, the specific role of Ets-1 was evaluated using mouse fibroblasts with a reduced Ets-1 expression caused by RNAi and compared to fibroblasts with a binding inhibition of the whole ETS transcription factor family by stably overexpressing the ETS DNA binding domain as transdominant-negative mutant. Our results demonstrate that p42 Ets-1 has quite different functions and target genes compared to p51 Ets-1 (e.g. TIMP-4, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13). In some cases (e.g. in cytokine expression) p42 Ets-1 is a functional transcription factor which acts in the same manner as a transdominant-negative approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hahne, JC","Fuchs, T","Florin, A","Edwards, DR","Pourtier, A","Soncin, F","Wernert, N"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2779642,"sim:weight":0.257945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769017,"sim:weight":0.245705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23815,"sim:weight":0.223571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.218134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.197143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.196993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146196,"sim:weight":0.187647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145537,"sim:weight":0.181632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.181525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.179861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.178551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.176893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761117,"sim:weight":0.175045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.15722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184423,"sim:weight":0.152631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585897,"sim:weight":0.146249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.144571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780389,"sim:weight":0.142428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98832,"sim:weight":0.138908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586636,"sim:weight":0.127615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The resulting Si-QDs dissolved in water and showed stable strong luminescence with peaks at 436 and 604 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to examine the surface electronic states after the synthesis. The co-existence of the Si2p and C1s core levels infers that the acrylic acid has been successfully grafted on the surface of silicon quantum dots. To fit the Si2p spectrum, four components were needed at 99.45, 100.28, 102.21 and 103.24 eV. The first component at 99.45 eV (I) was assigned to Si–Si within the silicon core of the Si-QDs. The second component at 100.28 eV (II) was from Si–C. The third at 102.21 eV (III) was a sub-oxide state and the fourth at 103.24 eV (IV) was from SiO2 at Si-QDs surface. With an increase in exposure to soft X-ray photons, the intensity ratio of the two peaks within the Si2p region A and B increased from 0.5 to 1.4 while the peak A intensity decreased, and eventually a steady state was reached. This observation is explained in terms of photon-induced oxidation taking place within the surface dangling bonds. As the PL profile for Si-QDs is influenced by the degree of oxidation within the nanocrystal structure, the inducement of oxidation by soft X-rays will play a role in the range of potential applications where such materials could be used – especially within biomedical labelling.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chao, Y","Wang, Q","Pietzsch, A","Hennies, F","Ni, H"],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Theoretical models indicate that allowing a regulated company to introduce optional (or self selecting) tariffs can make individual consumers (and consumers on average) better off and be profitable for the company, as long as the original (regulated) tariff remains available to all consumers.\r\n2. The models contain some restrictive assumptions and limitations and may be difficult to apply in practice.\r\n3. One particular assumption crucial to the benefits is that consumers choose the best tariff for themselves. More recent research on consumer behaviour in general and in utilities in particular show that this may not be the case. Much of the market literature has been concerned with the telecoms and energy markets.\r\n4. There may be distributional concerns if some consumer groups are less likely to choose well, particularly if there are likely to be long term effects on the ‘base’ tariff. Such concerns are reflected in the current British energy regulator’s consultation on reducing tariff choice for both suppliers and consumers as a response to perceived failure of competition. This experience raises questions about the intrinsic value of choice for consumers.\r\n5. Experience of optional metering in England and Wales provides some evidence of how residential water consumers have responded to that particular tariff choice.

The analysis reveals limited success in improving performance measurement practices (the content of change) in Trusts. Nevertheless the specific context within which change was operationalised was found to be very important, with central mangers playing a key role in influencing change. The process of change indicated slow shifts in clinical-accountant-managerial relations, partly driven by changes in financial flows within the organisations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guven-Uslu, Pinar","Conrad, Lynne"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

An Attempt of Analytical Unbundling of Competition from Consumer Welfare","bibo:abstract":"This paper is an attempt to evaluate the conceptual relationship between two central elements of the theory of antitrust: competition and consumer welfare. These two notions are analysed in their mutual dependency. The main purpose of this paper is to show that both competition and consumer welfare are economic values of fundamental importance with no ex ante hierarchical dominance of consumer welfare over competition. In case of conflict, priority might be given to either of these values depending on the context of the assessment. As can be understood from the very etymology of the term, competition is a notion which encompasses a process, more than a result. The notion of consumer welfare, on the other hand, is result-oriented. If we are interested in the outcomes that can be generated by competition only, then the very process of rivalry between undertakings would be seen as unnecessary or, at least, not indispensable. If, however, we consider that competition (seen as a process) is important for the societal paradigm of economic development, then the outcomes generated by this process are not the only reason for the rivalry between undertakings to exist. Methodologically, the latter approach appears to be more consistent with the idea of liberal democracy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andriychuk, Oles"],"dc:date":"2009-12-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2773549,"sim:weight":0.840855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767472,"sim:weight":0.659971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99495,"sim:weight":0.552807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.550767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.485757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090466,"sim:weight":0.46983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48320,"sim:weight":0.440856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187821,"sim:weight":0.439161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.427006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43493,"sim:weight":0.426899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.419833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.415157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225496,"sim:weight":0.412642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187811,"sim:weight":0.41147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.408543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.407232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.402393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.402232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45399,"sim:weight":0.392925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090413,"sim:weight":0.392026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The main novelty of this work is the use of data from company reports on the merger-generated synergy expectations signalled to shareholders, which allows the direct empirical testing of some of the assumptions and findings from previous works. Evidence is presented that the current EC merger control regime is incapable of extracting information from firms on their efficiency expectations; that pre-merger synergy expectations enhance the willingness to offer remedies; that false efficiency claims can be distinguished by looking at the timing of the remedy offer; and finally, that the cost of delay plays a central role in designing firms\u0027 litigation strategy, especially when these costs exceed the cost of the remedy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ormosi, Peter"],"dc:date":"2011-07-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5312297,"sim:weight":0.48484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775040,"sim:weight":0.481213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775043,"sim:weight":0.465652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090829,"sim:weight":0.414431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929873,"sim:weight":0.392083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47209,"sim:weight":0.332201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2774684,"sim:weight":0.331169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225504,"sim:weight":0.314394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108482,"sim:weight":0.298824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387410,"sim:weight":0.290844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43461,"sim:weight":0.287626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145549,"sim:weight":0.267851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5083867,"sim:weight":0.248365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.204923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46817,"sim:weight":0.194369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17326,"sim:weight":0.192873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101363,"sim:weight":0.177959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.176996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.174964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.174964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Information asymmetry between the merging parties and the competition authority makes the assessment of the former a challenging task. For this reason, competition authorities have an interest in encouraging merging parties to bring forward all available efficiency-related evidence. This paper looks at the European Commission’s practice between 1999 and 2009 to find out whether firms are provided sufficient incentives to reveal information on efficiencies. Evidence is presented that efficiency claims jeopardise the success of mergers by significantly delaying regulatory approval. Together with the fact that the ECMR allows firms to decide how much information to reveal on efficiencies may mean that efficiency-claims will only be made in cases where delay matters less for the merging parties.  For example, when the merger is not expected to generate large amounts of cost savings. Given this controversy, this article discusses the suitability of introducing further incentives to present efficiency-related evidence in EC merger cases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ormosi, Peter"],"dc:date":"2011-11-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5312297,"sim:weight":0.49047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929873,"sim:weight":0.433513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775043,"sim:weight":0.432398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775040,"sim:weight":0.40553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090829,"sim:weight":0.385149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2774684,"sim:weight":0.363979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95290,"sim:weight":0.355192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5689305,"sim:weight":0.332205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775062,"sim:weight":0.319746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47209,"sim:weight":0.316714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767472,"sim:weight":0.286886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5077652,"sim:weight":0.282911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47062,"sim:weight":0.279124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5080687,"sim:weight":0.270146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5074551,"sim:weight":0.27,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5083867,"sim:weight":0.265567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43461,"sim:weight":0.26237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775044,"sim:weight":0.261679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.254034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930215,"sim:weight":0.252706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the acute/non-genomic effects of DHT on amino acid uptake as well as the cellular signal transduction events underlying these actions in mouse fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibre bundles. 14C-Labelled amino acids were used to investigate the effects of DHT and testosterone (T) on amino acid uptake and pharmacological interventions were used to determine the cellular signal transduction events mediating these actions. While T had no effect on the uptake of isoleucine (Ile) and α-methylaminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB) in both fibre types, DHT increased their uptake in the fast-twitch fibre bundles. This effect was reversed by inhibitors of protein translation, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), system A, system L, mTOR and MEK. However, it was relatively insensitive to inhibitors of transcription, androgen receptors and PI3K/Akt. Additionally, DHT treatment increased the expression of LAT2 and the phosphorylation of the EGFR in the fast-twitch fibre bundles and that of ERK1/2, RSK1/2 and ATF2 in both fibre types. Also, it decreased the phosphorylation of eEF2 and increased the incorporation of Ile into proteins in both fibre types. Most of these effects were reversed by EGFR and MEK inhibitors. From these findings we suggest that another physiological function of the acute/non-genomic actions of DHT in isolated mammalian skeletal muscle fibres is to stimulate amino acid uptake. This effect is mediated through the EGFR and involves the activation of the MAPK pathway and an increase in LAT2 expression.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hamdi, MM","Mutungi, G"],"dc:date":"2011-07-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99428,"sim:weight":0.265191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184423,"sim:weight":0.199447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387047,"sim:weight":0.184956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99402,"sim:weight":0.181931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.175459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710117,"sim:weight":0.173491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.169905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.166905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709907,"sim:weight":0.16321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.150605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386738,"sim:weight":0.133278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340645,"sim:weight":0.130672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.121131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.11807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99270,"sim:weight":0.110695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thus, they have proved to be invaluable in the study of many transition metal-containing proteins. For mainly technical reasons, MCD has been limited almost exclusively to the measurement of static samples. But the ability to employ the resolving power of MCD to follow changes at transition metal sites would be a potentially significant advance. We describe here the development of a cuvette holder that allows reagent injection and sample mixing within the 50-mm-diameter ambient temperature bore of an energized superconducting solenoid. This has allowed us, for the first time, to monitor time-resolved MCD resulting from in situ chemical manipulation of a metalloprotein sample. Furthermore, we report the parallel development of an electrochemical cell using a three-electrode configuration with physically separated working and counter electrodes, allowing true potentiometric titration to be performed within the bore of the MCD solenoid.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bradley, Jenna","Butt, Julea","Cheesman, Myles"],"dc:date":"2011-12-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.430659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777073,"sim:weight":0.391999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.355318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777786,"sim:weight":0.347494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2971,"sim:weight":0.29508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205917,"sim:weight":0.277549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44440,"sim:weight":0.266588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113592,"sim:weight":0.262767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1625899,"sim:weight":0.260208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.25491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.248302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1602292,"sim:weight":0.24612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890301,"sim:weight":0.240086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101346,"sim:weight":0.239956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146046,"sim:weight":0.239446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.236309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.232133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43583,"sim:weight":0.230065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.22911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890299,"sim:weight":0.225445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In Shewanella oneidensis this involves decaheme cytochromes that are located on the bacterial cell surface at the termini of trans-outer-membrane electron transfer conduits. The cell surface cytochromes can potentially play multiple roles in mediating electron transfer directly to insoluble electron sinks, catalyzing electron exchange with flavin electron shuttles or participating in extracellular intercytochrome electron exchange along “nanowire” appendages. We present a 3.2-Å crystal structure of one of these decaheme cytochromes, MtrF, that allows the spatial organization of the 10 hemes to be visualized for the first time. The hemes are organized across four domains in a unique crossed conformation, in which a staggered 65-Å octaheme chain transects the length of the protein and is bisected by a planar 45-Å tetraheme chain that connects two extended Greek key split β-barrel domains. The structure provides molecular insight into how reduction of insoluble substrate (e.g., minerals), soluble substrates (e.g., flavins), and cytochrome redox partners might be possible in tandem at different termini of a trifurcated electron transport chain on the cell surface.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clarke, TA","Edwards, MJ","Gates, AJ","Hall, A","White, GF","Bradley, J","Reardon, CL","Shi, L","Beliaev, AS","Marshall, MJ","Wang, Z","Watmough, NJ","Fredrickson, JK","Zachara, JM","Butt, JN","Richardson, DJ"],"dc:date":"2011-06-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2769050,"sim:weight":0.690887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777073,"sim:weight":0.651529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777786,"sim:weight":0.588435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.553596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.414135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154191,"sim:weight":0.371185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870225,"sim:weight":0.362206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26920,"sim:weight":0.353041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4868971,"sim:weight":0.332869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185139,"sim:weight":0.32358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205917,"sim:weight":0.322458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769012,"sim:weight":0.314131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9257210,"sim:weight":0.306467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.299825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1625899,"sim:weight":0.296875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.29197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113592,"sim:weight":0.291162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585857,"sim:weight":0.289663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2971,"sim:weight":0.282041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47262,"sim:weight":0.281554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Of the genes in the human genome, 30% code for membrane proteins (Krogh et al. J. Mol. Biol.2001, 305, 567). Furthermore, many FDA-approved drugs target such proteins (Overington et al. Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery2006, 5, 993). However, the structure−function relationships of these are notably sparse because of difficulties in their purification and handling outside of their membranous environment. Methods that permit the manipulation of membrane components while they are still in the membrane would find widespread application in separation, purification, and eventual structure−function determination of these species (Poo et al. Nature1977, 265, 602). Here we show that asymmetrically patterned supported lipid bilayers in combination with AC electric fields can lead to efficient manipulation of charged components. We demonstrate the concentration and trapping of such components through the use of a “nested trap” and show that this method is capable of yielding an approximately 30-fold increase in the average protein concentration. Upon removal of the field, the material remains trapped for several hours as a result of topographically restricted diffusion. Our results indicate that this method can be used for concentrating and trapping charged membrane components while they are still within their membranous environment. We anticipate that our approach could find widespread application in the manipulation and study of membrane proteins.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cheetham, MR","Bramble, JP","McMillan, DGG","Krzeminski, L","Han, X","Johnson, BRG","Bushby, RJ","Olmsted, PD","Jeuken, LJC","Marritt, SJ","Butt, JN","Evans, SD"],"dc:date":"2011-05-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6205917,"sim:weight":0.438882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.385749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47603,"sim:weight":0.381328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23127,"sim:weight":0.37082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44193,"sim:weight":0.349274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47635,"sim:weight":0.331442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931940,"sim:weight":0.329284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.325675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98837,"sim:weight":0.321282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99146,"sim:weight":0.31519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23095,"sim:weight":0.3083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98959,"sim:weight":0.30379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113592,"sim:weight":0.299864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.294413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.293414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.286867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.284283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.283994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12217,"sim:weight":0.279097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222852,"sim:weight":0.277372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The predominant biological mechanism of detecting NO is through the formation of iron nitrosyl complexes, although this is a deleterious process for other iron-containing enzymes. We have previously applied techniques such as UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy to the analysis of protein Fe-NO complex formation in order to study how NO controls the activity of the bacterial transcriptional regulators NorR and NsrR. These studies have analysed NO-dependent biological activity both in vitro and in vivo using diverse biochemical, molecular and spectroscopic methods. Recently, we have applied ultrafast 2D-IR (two-dimensional IR) spectroscopy to the analysis of NO-protein interactions using Mb (myoglobin) and Cc (cytochrome c) as model haem proteins. The ultrafast fluctuations of Cc and Mb show marked differences, indicating altered flexibility of the haem pockets. We have extended this analysis to bacterial catalase enzymes that are known to play a role in the nitrosative stress response by detoxifying peroxynitrite.

Recent critiques have questioned the validity of the leading theory for explaining social evolution and eusociality, namely inclusive fitness (kin selection) theory. I review recent and past literature to argue that these critiques do not succeed. Inclusive fitness theory has added fundamental insights to natural selection theory. These are the realization that selection on a gene for social behaviour depends on its effects on co-bearers, the explanation of social behaviours as unalike as altruism and selfishness using the same underlying parameters, and the explanation of within-group conflict in terms of non-coinciding inclusive fitness optima. A proposed alternative theory for eusocial evolution assumes mistakenly that workers’ interests are subordinate to the queen’s, contains no new elements and fails to make novel predictions. The haplodiploidy hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested and positive relatedness within diploid eusocial societies supports inclusive fitness theory.

Most commentators deal predominantly with damages actions and the European policy proposals only discuss the conditions for successful compensation claims. However, damages claims are likely to be the most expensive and time consuming remedy available. In many cases injunctive relief may be cheaper and, thus, be preferred by the victim. Asking the court to order the perpetrator to either cease from certain behaviour or to undertake certain actions, plaintiffs might be willing to forego compensation in exchange for a quicker dispute solution with effect for the future. The variety and flexibility of injunctive relief – injunctions can be granted on a preliminary basis or permanently, contain a prohibition or being mandatory – provides victims of anticompetitive conduct with a multi-functional tool to seek relief. The paper compares the usage of and the legal framework for injunctive relief in England and Wales and Germany. The antitrust litigation data available for both jurisdictions indicate that the use of injunctive relief in English and German courts differs greatly. Analysing the legal framework for injunctive relief, I will look at the judicial approach that is taken with respect to injunctions and the possible reason for a varying usage of this remedy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Peyer, Sebastian"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2734384,"sim:weight":0.325083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176928,"sim:weight":0.150883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two compared stretching with a control, one study compared stretching to an alternative intervention, one study compared stretching to both alternative and control interventions, and two compared different stretching techniques and durations. Quality rating on the modified Pedro scale varied from two to eight out of a maximum of ten points. The methodologies and interventions varied significantly between studies, making meta-analysis inappropriate. Most participants improved over the course of the studies, but when stretching was compared to alternative or control interventions, the changes only reached statistical significance in one study that used a combination of calf muscle stretches and plantar fascia stretches in their stretching programme. Another study comparing different stretching techniques, showed a statistically significant reduction in some aspects of pain in favour of plantar fascia stretching over calf stretches in the short term.\r\n\r\nThere were too few studies to assess whether stretching is effective compared to control or other interventions, for either pain or function.

In bivariate analysis, risk behaviours significantly associated with higher syphilis incidence included injection of cocaine, “speedball” and heroin, “crack” smoking, recency of first injection event, backloading of syringes, injecting with others, exchanging drugs or money for sex, multiple sex partners, and non-heterosexual sexual preference. Variables that significantly predicted syphilis infection at follow up in the multivariate analysis included multiple sex partners (RR\u003d7.8; 95% CI 2.4, 25.0), exchanging money for sex (RR\u003d3.0; 95% CI 0.9, 9.6), and recent initiation to injection drug use (RR\u003d4.6; 95% CI 1.1, 18.8).\r\n\r\nConclusion: Syphilis transmission among IDUs in Los Angeles County remains a serious public health concern, particularly among IDUs who engage in trading of sex for money or drugs. Although low, the prevalence of HIV observed in this study constitutes a serious concern because of the potential for expanded HIV transmission in this susceptible population of IDUs with high syphilis incidence. Enhanced case finding screening efforts and prevention of transmission of sexually transmitted infections should specifically target hard to reach IDUs and their sexual partners.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lopez-Zetina, J","Ford, W","Weber, M","Barna, S","Woerhle, T","Kerndt, P","Monterroso, E"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.378123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.31059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.298242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22728,"sim:weight":0.298192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.276769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":190981,"sim:weight":0.272367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145923,"sim:weight":0.257653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":190907,"sim:weight":0.24925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9028213,"sim:weight":0.23348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229645,"sim:weight":0.223184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.215455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.210363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.20549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.202974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29886,"sim:weight":0.199346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.198146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5709503,"sim:weight":0.196856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.196541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.194836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.194836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Based on empirical material from a village in Bangladesh, this paper explores the role of madrasa education in challenging the dominant paradigm of learning embedded in formal secular schooling. Despite charges of low quality and traditionalism, local narratives reveal how madrasa learning is used to negotiate and transform inequalities, both in material and social terms. Madrasa education is cheaper, and addresses issues of poverty, but the narratives also emphasise learning the Arabic language, seen to facilitate male overseas migration to the Gulf countries, a channel for upward social and economic mobility. In a context of global competition that supports individualism, a focus on character and morality as represented through an Islamic identity, alongside communitarian values, is seen as important for maintaining a degree of social cohesion and is hence socially valued. Reading and reciting the Quran are also viewed as essential traits for a woman, enabling her to appropriately socialise her children in the absence of her migrant husband. One finds here a simultaneous process of contestation and resistance, seeking successful occupational trajectories and social recognition for men, while at the same time contributing to the reproduction of gendered inequalities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rao, Nitya"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.488008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.479891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181180,"sim:weight":0.477825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9541110,"sim:weight":0.464361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.459217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.455214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.441597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709893,"sim:weight":0.44089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710045,"sim:weight":0.428485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.421532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48397,"sim:weight":0.420159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446416,"sim:weight":0.419254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.415708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.408418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.408051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.40637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.40637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383571,"sim:weight":0.405991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710073,"sim:weight":0.402567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316070,"sim:weight":0.401871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Yet there has been little exploration of fashion and its use in television. Existing work on fashion in onscreen media has approached the debate from a textual perspective, and such\r\nwork has been informed by the longstanding assumption that fashion acts primarily as ‘spectacle’, disrupting the economy of narrative flow. This article seeks to challenge this assumption by arguing that previous work is limited by the wider conceptual and methodological problems of purely textual approaches. Using CW’s Gossip Girl as a case study, the author suggests that a mixed method approach to the study of costume (using both textual analysis and reception studies) provides a more productive foundation upon which to begin to examine the function of onscreen fashion in contemporary US television. Such an approach may have particular importance in understanding how costume in ‘fashion-forward’ television can be best understood if one steps beyond the text to explore the sense-making of viewers, the intentions of costume designers and the relationship between viewers, the shows and the wider fashion market.","bibo:AuthorList":["Warner, Helen"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2777917,"sim:weight":0.658392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43428,"sim:weight":0.392528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47210,"sim:weight":0.374984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.355123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77012,"sim:weight":0.354378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761070,"sim:weight":0.351379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.341918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.326065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46824,"sim:weight":0.323184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.318124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46714,"sim:weight":0.306469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47288,"sim:weight":0.305988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445178,"sim:weight":0.302874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.2997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48343,"sim:weight":0.289175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.286181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47204,"sim:weight":0.285872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99315,"sim:weight":0.285006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45046,"sim:weight":0.283835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99058,"sim:weight":0.283425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The problem is a  eneralisation of the steady oblique stagnation-point flow examined by previous workers. Far from the wall, the flow is composed of an irrotational orthogonal stagnation-point flow with a time-periodic strength, a simple shear flow of constant vorticity, and a time-periodic uniform stream. An exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is sought for which the flow  streamfunction depends linearly on the coordinate parallel to the wall. The problem formulation reduces to a coupled pair of partial differential equations in time and one spatial variable. The first equation describes the oscillatory orthogonal stagnation-point flow discussed by previous workers. The second equation, which couples to the first, describes the oblique component of the flow. A description of the flow velocity field, the  instantaneous streamlines, and the particle paths is sought through numerical solutions of the governing equations and via asymptotic analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tooke, R","Blyth, MG","Hammerton, PW"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2767708,"sim:weight":0.773626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.439261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43777,"sim:weight":0.437418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.4348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98760,"sim:weight":0.405948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.402497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.386989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28665,"sim:weight":0.384246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24687,"sim:weight":0.381731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145764,"sim:weight":0.372775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769266,"sim:weight":0.356312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1568162,"sim:weight":0.354934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8335,"sim:weight":0.350539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1568100,"sim:weight":0.345951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.345293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97160,"sim:weight":0.341266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43507,"sim:weight":0.337324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767716,"sim:weight":0.332841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268054,"sim:weight":0.331729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96505,"sim:weight":0.326949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The potential for soil-isolated Bacillus sp. and Citrobacter sp. to reduce NO3-, and produce NH4+, NO2- and N2O was examined in batch and continuous (chemostat) cultures under different C-to-NO3- ratios, NO3--limiting (5 mM) and NO3--sufficient (22 mM) conditions. C-to-NO3- ratio had a major influence on the products of nitrate ammonification, with NO2-, rather than NH4+, being the major product at low C-to-NO3- ratios in batch cultures. N2O production was maximum and accompanied by high NO2- production under C-limitation/NO3-sufficiency conditions in chemostat cultures. In media with lower C-to-NO3-N ratios (5- and 10-to-1) up to 2.7% or 5.0% of NO3- was reduced to N2O by Bacillus sp. and Citrobacter sp., respectively, but these reduction efficiencies were only 0.1% or 0.7% at higher C-to-NO3- ratios (25- and 50-to-1). As the highest N2O production did not occur under the same C-to-NO3- conditions as highest NH4+ production we suggest that a re-evaluation may be necessary of the environmental conditions under which nitrate ammonification contributes to N2O emission from soil.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stremińska, MA","Felgate, H","Rowley, G","Richardson, DJ","Baggs, EM"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1007433,"sim:weight":0.421537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4894185,"sim:weight":0.279427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.263259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61457,"sim:weight":0.250101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46882,"sim:weight":0.216951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76096,"sim:weight":0.212305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269539,"sim:weight":0.208267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222850,"sim:weight":0.202734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.201816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18949,"sim:weight":0.200341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2835560,"sim:weight":0.200341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98941,"sim:weight":0.185835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631958,"sim:weight":0.183449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102601,"sim:weight":0.181565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26680,"sim:weight":0.181052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.180648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.172176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632032,"sim:weight":0.159102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.153101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.148871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An incentive mechanism to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) is being negotiated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Here we use the best available global data sets on terrestrial biodiversity and carbon storage to map and investigate potential synergies between carbon and biodiversity-oriented conservation. A strong association (rS\u003d 0.82) between carbon stocks and species richness suggests that such synergies would be high, but unevenly distributed. Many areas of high value for biodiversity could be protected by carbon-based conservation, while others could benefit from complementary funding arising from their carbon content. Some high-biodiversity regions, however, would not benefit from carbon-focused conservation, and could become under increased pressure if REDD is implemented. Our results suggest that additional gains for biodiversity conservation are possible, without compromising the effectiveness for climate change mitigation, if REDD takes biodiversity distribution into account.","bibo:AuthorList":["Strassburg, BBN","Kelly, A","Balmford, A","Davies, RG","Gibbs, HK","Lovett, A","Miles, L","Orme, CDL","Price, J","Turner, RK","Rodrigues, ASL"],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":97600,"sim:weight":0.505161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61457,"sim:weight":0.432203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60817,"sim:weight":0.395249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.341249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.341248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68722,"sim:weight":0.332701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.320674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.29274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.287989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.286478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.278628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.271582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.271582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.26793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.25072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384788,"sim:weight":0.241333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.212208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.181444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.181444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.179149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This allows nitrite to be used as a terminal electron acceptor, facilitating anaerobic respiration while allowing nitrogen to remain in a biologically available form. NrfA has also been reported to reduce nitric oxide (a reaction intermediate) and sulfite to ammonia and sulfide respectively, suggesting a potential secondary role as a detoxification enzyme. The protein sequences and crystal structures of NrfA from different bacteria and the closely related octahaem nitrite reductase from Thioalkalivibrio nitratireducens (TvNir) reveal that these enzymes are homologous. The NrfA proteins contain five covalently attached haem groups, four of which are bis-histidine-co-ordinated, with the proximal histidine being provided by the highly conserved CXXCH motif. These haems are responsible for intraprotein electron transfer. The remaining haem is the site for nitrite reduction, which is ligated by a novel lysine residue provided by a CXXCK haem-binding motif. The TvNir nitrite reductase has five haems that are structurally similar to those of NrfA and three extra bis-histidine-coordinated haems that precede the NrfA conserved region. The present review compares the protein sequences and structures of NrfA and TvNir and discusses the subtle differences related to active-site architecture and Ca2+ binding that may have an impact on substrate reduction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lockwood, CWJ","Clarke, TA","Butt, JN","Hemmings, AM","Richardson, DJ"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2777074,"sim:weight":0.748804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775724,"sim:weight":0.319013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.313837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769016,"sim:weight":0.183161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780475,"sim:weight":0.171817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768022,"sim:weight":0.150602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146021,"sim:weight":0.128004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.127356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631958,"sim:weight":0.122215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.121652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For the ferric state, these conformers are His/Lys- and His/OH–-ligated. The ferrous state is predominantly high-spin and, most likely, His/–. Interconversion of the ferric and ferrous conformers is described by a single midpoint potential of −80 ± 9 mV vs SHE.

In contrast, the utilization of nitrate by heterotrophic bacteria has historically received less attention because the primary role of these organisms has classically been considered to be the decomposition and mineralization of dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen. In the pre-genome sequence era, it was known that some, but not all, heterotrophic bacteria were capable of growth on nitrate as a sole nitrogen source. However, examination of currently available prokaryotic genome sequences suggests that assimilatory nitrate reductase (Nas) systems are widespread phylogenetically in bacterial and archaeal heterotrophs. Until now, regulation of nitrate assimilation has been mainly studied in cyanobacteria. In contrast, in heterotrophic bacterial strains, the study of nitrate assimilation regulation has been limited to Rhodobacter capsulatus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Azotobacter vinelandii and Bacillus subtilis. In Gram-negative bacteria, the nas genes are subjected to dual control: ammonia repression by the general nitrogen regulatory (Ntr) system and specific nitrate or nitrite induction. The Ntr system is widely distributed in bacteria, whereas the nitrate/nitrite-specific control is variable depending on the organism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Luque‑Almagro, VM","Gates, AJ","Moreno‑Vivián, C","Ferguson, SJ","Richardson, DJ","Roldán, MD"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2781134,"sim:weight":0.439123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.236684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4869897,"sim:weight":0.233648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229128,"sim:weight":0.229571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769012,"sim:weight":0.213457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779631,"sim:weight":0.20972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46512,"sim:weight":0.204313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.20048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.200323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45241,"sim:weight":0.198599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381911,"sim:weight":0.196256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44537,"sim:weight":0.196097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768022,"sim:weight":0.191343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779652,"sim:weight":0.190119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4868971,"sim:weight":0.186673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780475,"sim:weight":0.181956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.181558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769037,"sim:weight":0.180086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.178922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5228600,"sim:weight":0.176756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One group is the Enterobacteriaceae family of Gammaproteobacteria, which have their natural habitats in soil, marine environments or the intestines of humans and other warm-blooded animals. Some of the genera are pathogenic and usually associated with intestinal infections. Our body possesses several physical and chemical defence mechanisms to prevent pathogenic enteric bacteria from invading the gastrointestinal tract. One response of the innate immune system is to activate macrophages, which produce the potent cytotoxin nitric oxide (NO). However, some pathogens have evolved the ability to detoxify NO to less toxic compounds, such as the neuropharmacological agent and greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), which enables them to overcome the host\u0027s attack. The same mechanisms may be used by bacteria producing NO endogenously as a by-product of anaerobic nitrate respiration. In the present review, we provide a brief introduction into the NO detoxification mechanisms of two members of the Enterobacteriaceae family: Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. These are discussed as comparative non-pathogenic and pathogenic model systems in order to investigate the importance of detoxifying NO and producing N2O for the pathogenicity of enteric bacteria.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arkenberg, A","Runkel, S","Richardson, DJ","Rowley, G"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2781216,"sim:weight":0.543956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2781196,"sim:weight":0.474435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780599,"sim:weight":0.41165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.344727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.289427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.280703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.265845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780475,"sim:weight":0.246952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.234804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145556,"sim:weight":0.23069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101347,"sim:weight":0.230569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.227911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761085,"sim:weight":0.207181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.204303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.2029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.196101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5228600,"sim:weight":0.19144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778837,"sim:weight":0.18791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99459,"sim:weight":0.180593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12359,"sim:weight":0.177537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Salmonella can synthesize two types of nitrate reductase: a membrane-bound form (Nar) and a periplasmic form (Nap). Nitrate catabolism was studied under nitrate-rich and nitrate-limited conditions in chemostat cultures following transition from oxic to anoxic conditions. Intracellular NO production was reported qualitatively by assessing transcription of the NO-regulated genes encoding flavohaemoglobin (Hmp), flavorubredoxin (NorV) and hybrid cluster protein (Hcp). A more quantitative analysis of the extent of NO formation was gained by measuring production of N2O, the end-product of anoxic NO-detoxification. Under nitrate-rich conditions, the nar, nap, hmp, norV and hcp genes were all induced following transition from the oxic to anoxic state, and 20% of nitrate consumed in steady-state was released as N2O when nitrite had accumulated to millimolar levels. The kinetics of nitrate consumption, nitrite accumulation and N2O production were similar to those of wild-type in nitrate-sufficient cultures of a nap mutant. In contrast, in a narG mutant, the steady-state rate of N2O production was ~30-fold lower than that of the wild-type. Under nitrate-limited conditions, nap, but not nar, was up-regulated following transition from oxic to anoxic metabolism and very little N2O production was observed. Thus a combination of nitrate-sufficiency, nitrite accumulation and an active Nar-type nitrate reductase leads to NO and thence N2O production, and this can account for up to 20% of the nitrate catabolized.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rowley, G","Hensen, D","Felgate, H","Arkenberg, A","Appia‑Ayme, C","Prior, K","Harrington, C","Field, SJ","Butt, JN","Baggs, E","Richardson, DJ"],"dc:date":"2012-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2781215,"sim:weight":0.543956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9257124,"sim:weight":0.32348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here we use the ultrafast optical Kerr effect to study the H-bond structure and dynamics of aqueous solutions of proteins. Measurements are made for three proteins as a function of concentration. We find that the water dynamics in the first solvation layer of the proteins are slowed by up to a factor of 8 in comparison to those in bulk water. The most marked slowdown was observed for the most hydrophilic protein studied, bovine serum albumin, whereas the most hydrophobic protein, trypsin, had a slightly smaller effect. The terahertz Raman spectra of these protein solutions resemble those of pure water up to 5 wt % of protein, above which a new feature appears at 80 cm–1, which is assigned to a bending of the protein amide chain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mazur, K","Heisler, IA","Meech, SR"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.372047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108049,"sim:weight":0.369356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.354845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47658,"sim:weight":0.344441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.337571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1602292,"sim:weight":0.332503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387413,"sim:weight":0.330497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1625899,"sim:weight":0.330405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12333,"sim:weight":0.321989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710180,"sim:weight":0.316861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85991,"sim:weight":0.315401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890307,"sim:weight":0.313121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113592,"sim:weight":0.30687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.305023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43026,"sim:weight":0.299961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.298903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.284197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108054,"sim:weight":0.281505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98875,"sim:weight":0.280688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890301,"sim:weight":0.277805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These discussions revealed that the establishment of separate antiretroviral treatment services for HIV had resulted in problems in accessing care due to the large number of patients at ART clinics. The intervention developed therefore combined the shifting from doctors to nurses of prescriptions of antiretrovirals (ARVs) for uncomplicated patients and the stepwise integration of HIV care into primary care services.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nComponents of the intervention\r\nThe intervention consisted of regulatory changes, training, and guidelines to support nurse ART prescription, local management teams, an implementation toolkit, and a flexible, phased introduction.

First, they are often premised upon simplistic understandings of development processes and misleading definitions of later life. Second, they are fixated on issues of pension policy and income security, ignoring many other issues of critical importance to older people in developing countries. This chapter begins by briefly reviewing notions of “international development”. This shows that developments can be interpreted in different ways and that these interpretations have important consequences for how we identify and perceive ageing and development issues. The chapter provides goes on to demonstrate how ageing and older people have remained a relatively marginal concern for global development agencies, and how this has been supplanted by a narrow focus on pension reform. This leads on to a discussion of the simplified and largely negative portrayal of older people in development thinking. The consequences of this limited approach are briefly illustrated with case studies from India and South Africa. The chapter concludes by making a number of suggestions about how to move towards a more nuanced and helpful understanding of ageing and development issues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lloyd-Sherlock, Peter","Leisering, Lutz"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4187789,"sim:weight":0.291389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":223329,"sim:weight":0.284512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.26167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.251963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47362,"sim:weight":0.251102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633023,"sim:weight":0.249518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48400,"sim:weight":0.24712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930821,"sim:weight":0.245724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.238481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43173,"sim:weight":0.230185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382971,"sim:weight":0.226487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.222562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.221089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761132,"sim:weight":0.219317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.217506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85489,"sim:weight":0.217038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709549,"sim:weight":0.21668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93672,"sim:weight":0.205656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.205576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145895,"sim:weight":0.204121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These proteins can also be sensed by the plant immune system, leading to restriction of pathogen growth. Effector genes can display signatures of positive selection and rapid evolution, presumably a consequence of their co-evolutionary arms race with plants. The molecular mechanisms underlying how effectors evolve to gain new virulence functions and/or evade the plant immune system are poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structures of the effector domains from two oomycete RXLR proteins, Phytophthora capsici AVR3a11 and Phytophthora infestans PexRD2. Despite sharing \u003c20% sequence identity in their effector domains, they display a conserved core α-helical fold. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that the core fold occurs in ∼44% of annotated Phytophthora RXLR effectors, both as a single domain and in tandem repeats of up to 11 units. Functionally important and polymorphic residues map to the surface of the structures, and PexRD2, but not AVR3a11, oligomerizes in planta. We conclude that the core α-helical fold enables functional adaptation of these fast evolving effectors through (i) insertion/deletions in loop regions between α-helices, (ii) extensions to the N and C termini, (iii) amino acid replacements in surface residues, (iv) tandem domain duplications, and (v) oligomerization. We hypothesize that the molecular stability provided by this core fold, combined with considerable potential for plasticity, underlies the evolution of effectors that maintain their virulence activities while evading recognition by the plant immune system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boutemy, LS","King, SRF","Win, Joe","Hughes, RK","Clarke, TA","Blumenschein, TMA","Kamoun, S","Banfield, MJ"],"dc:date":"2011-10-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The University of East Anglia Impaired Fasting Glucose (UEA-IFG) feasibility programme was a structured dietary and exercise intervention to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in susceptible individuals. Lay volunteers with T2DM (T2 trainers) were recruited to support participants in adopting healthier lifestyles. This study aimed to explore the acceptability, perceived effectiveness and sustainability of lay trainers within the programme.\r\nDesign: A qualitative focus group study.\r\nSetting: A clinical research unit in Norwich, United Kingdom (UK).\r\nMethod: Focus groups were conducted with: (1) T2 trainers (n \u003d 15); (2) programme participants who had received their support (n \u003d 11); and (3) salaried staff facilitators who had worked alongside the T2 trainers (n \u003d 3). Framework analysis was applied to identify the different experiences of the lay trainer role.\r\nResults: All groups perceived advantages for peer support, particularly in sharing the day-to-day experiences of living with T2DM. However, staff facilitators raised the importance of role boundaries, emphasizing that T2 trainers should not provide medical advice. Acceptability of T2 trainers was enhanced by contacting participants at a convenient time and before substantial lifestyle changes had been made.\r\nConclusion: Lay trainers were seen as a complementary method to motivate individuals to reduce their risks of T2DM. A less prescriptive approach needs to be adopted to enable full integration of lay trainers, allowing them a greater level of contribution. To sustain effective use of lay trainers, health professionals need to work alongside volunteers and be trained to encourage peer involvement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scarpello, TJ","Murray, NJ","Maisey, S","Howe, AC","Sampson, MJ"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145584,"sim:weight":0.480657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.349407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.341706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.337836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43411,"sim:weight":0.334523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.325586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.322097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229643,"sim:weight":0.320572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.310631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.31061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.305048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.304099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.302678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.302678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.302678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.302678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.302678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.302678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.302678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.302678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Following positive appraisals of NREGS based on quantitative data (e.g. Uppal 2009), the paper uses individual and group interview and household survey data from adults and children aged 15-16 to explore firstly whether these appraisals are confirmed by children’s accounts of its impact, and secondly whether the evidence from the three villages sub-sampled in the qualitative research suggest its success is sustainable (for example, instances of financial mismanagement, growing resentment among local landlords, etc.). One positive finding is that participation in NREGS is high and largely pro-poor. There are striking examples of individual benefits, intended and unintended, for example, female labourers who no longer accept a daily wage of Rs 40. There may also be significant environmental benefits, although these will not be evident for another three to four years. However, those who only work in the scheme because they are landless have not benefitted as much as expected. The main beneficiaries in the three villages have been individual farmers, often from higher castes, and to some extent administering officials. So while interview and survey data demonstrate beneficial effects, the systemic mismanagement described in the paper is having a corrosive effect on trust and social relationships. This unintended consequence threatens the sustainability of the scheme and its potential to reduce socio-economic inequalities and vulnerability across the life course.","bibo:AuthorList":["Camfield, Laura","Vennam, Uma"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2767488,"sim:weight":0.274723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709978,"sim:weight":0.271996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48338,"sim:weight":0.256883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156428,"sim:weight":0.254327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187702,"sim:weight":0.253751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53524,"sim:weight":0.25344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96425,"sim:weight":0.250746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664548,"sim:weight":0.248828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46592,"sim:weight":0.242021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155864,"sim:weight":0.236792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2781857,"sim:weight":0.23668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101196,"sim:weight":0.236352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187716,"sim:weight":0.23584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769036,"sim:weight":0.231577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85288,"sim:weight":0.229405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709557,"sim:weight":0.228809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45893,"sim:weight":0.227359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.226997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109198,"sim:weight":0.226285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3010,"sim:weight":0.223946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this paper we study whether licensing is an effective solution for hold-up. To do this we distinguish between ex ante\r\nand ex post licensing. A theoretical model shows that firms’ expectations of blocking in a patent thicket determine whether they license ex ante while ex post licensing arises if expected blocking was low but realized blocking turns out to be high. It can also be shown that ex ante licensing will allow firms to reduce their patenting efforts. A sample selection model of licensing is derived from the theoretical model. Applying this to data from the semiconductor industry we show that licensing does help firms to resolve blocking.

We analysed all admissions to the English National Health Service (NHS) during the financial year 2009/10, following up all patients for 30 days after admission and accounting for risk of death associated with diagnosis, co-morbidities, admission history, age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, seasonality, day of admission and hospital trust, including day of death as a time dependent covariate. The principal analysis was based on time to in-hospital death.Participants National Health Service Hospitals in England.Main Outcome Measures 30 day mortality (in or out of hospital).Results There were 14,217,640 admissions included in the principal analysis, with 187,337 in-hospital deaths reported within 30 days of admission. Admission on weekend days was associated with a considerable increase in risk of subsequent death compared with admission on weekdays, hazard ratio for Sunday versus Wednesday 1.16 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.18; P \u003c .0001), and for Saturday versus Wednesday 1.11 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.13; P \u003c .0001). Hospital stays on weekend days were associated with a lower risk of death than midweek days, hazard ratio for being in hospital on Sunday versus Wednesday 0.92 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.94; P \u003c .0001), and for Saturday versus Wednesday 0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.96; P \u003c .0001). Similar findings were observed on a smaller US data set.Conclusions Admission at the weekend is associated with increased risk of subsequent death within 30 days of admission. The likelihood of death actually occurring is less on a weekend day than on a mid-week day.","bibo:AuthorList":["Freemantle,  N","Richardson,  M","Wood, J","Ray,  D","Khosla,  S","Shahian,  D","Roche,  WR","Stephens,  I","Keogh,  B","Pagano,  D"],"dc:date":"2012-02-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67270,"sim:weight":0.139059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The ESR (envelope stress response) pathways of enteric bacteria are critical for maintenance of the envelope against these antimicrobial agents. In the present study, we demonstrate that the periplasmic protein ZraP contributes to envelope homoeostasis and assign both chaperone and regulatory function to ZraP from Salmonella Typhimurium. The ZraP chaperone mechanism is catalytic and independent of ATP; the chaperone activity is dependent on the presence of zinc, which is shown to be responsible for the stabilization of an oligomeric ZraP complex. Furthermore, ZraP can act to repress the two-component regulatory system ZraSR, which itself is responsive to zinc concentrations. Through structural homology, ZraP is a member of the bacterial CpxP family of periplasmic proteins, which also consists of CpxP and Spy.

This includes the propagation of equatorial waves in the Indian Ocean, from the generation of oceanic equatorial Kelvin waves to the arrival of downwelling oceanic equatorial Rossby waves in the western Indian Ocean, where they have been shown to trigger MJO convective activity. Simulations with idealised wind forcing suggest that the latitudinal width of this forcing plays a crucial role in determining the potential for such feedbacks. Forcing the model with composite MJO winds accurately captures the global ocean response, demonstrating that the observed ocean dynamical response to the MJO can be interpreted as a linear response to surface wind forcing.\r\n\r\nThe model is then applied to study “primary” Madden-Julian events, which are not immediately preceded by any MJO activity nor by any apparent atmospheric triggers, but have been shown to coincide with the arrival of downwelling oceanic equatorial Rossby waves. Case study simulations show how this oceanic equatorial Rossby wave activity is partly forced by reflection of an oceanic equatorial Kelvin wave triggered by a westerly wind burst 140 days previously, and partly directly forced by easterly wind stress anomalies around 40 days prior to the event. This suggests predictability for primary Madden-Julian events on times scales of up to five months, following the re-emergence of oceanic anomalies forced by winds almost half a year earlier.","bibo:AuthorList":["Webber, BGM","Stevens, DP","Matthews, AJ","Heywood, KJ"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2768886,"sim:weight":0.565581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778550,"sim:weight":0.373931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2766165,"sim:weight":0.33328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2674698,"sim:weight":0.327294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here we present results from a method developed to calculate diapycnal diffusivity from moored Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) velocity shear profiles. An 18-month time series of diffusivity is presented from data taken by a LongRanger ADCP moored at 2400 m depth, 600 m above the sea floor, in Shag Rocks Passage, a deep passage in the North Scotia Ridge (Southern Ocean). The Polar Front is constrained to pass through this passage, and the strong currents and complex topography are expected to result in enhanced mixing. The spatial distribution of diffusivity in Shag Rocks Passage deduced from lowered ADCP shear is consistent with published values for similar regions, with diffusivity possibly as large as 90 × 10−4 m2 s−1 near the sea floor, decreasing to the expected background level of ~ 0.1 × 10−4 m2 s−1 in areas away from topography. The moored ADCP profiles spanned a depth range of 2400 to 1800 m; thus the moored time series was obtained from a region of moderately enhanced diffusivity.\r\n\r\nThe diffusivity time series has a median of 3.3 × 10−4 m2 s−1 and a range of 0.5 × 10−4 m2 s−1 to 57 × 10−4 m2 s−1. There is no significant signal at annual or semiannual periods, but there is evidence of signals at periods of approximately fourteen days (likely due to the spring-neaps tidal cycle), and at periods of 3.8 and 2.6 days most likely due to topographically-trapped waves propagating around the local seamount. Using the observed stratification and an axisymmetric seamount, of similar dimensions to the one west of the mooring, in a model of baroclinic topographically-trapped waves, produces periods of 3.8 and 2.6 days, in agreement with the signals observed. The diffusivity is anti-correlated with the rotary coefficient (indicating that stronger mixing occurs during times of upward energy propagation), which suggests that mixing occurs due to the breaking of internal waves generated at topography.","bibo:AuthorList":["Damerell, GM","Heywood, KJ","Stevens, DP","Naveira Garabato, Alberto C."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We investigate the intertwining relations of simple characters of these groups, in particular their preservation properties under transfer. This allows us to associate to any discrete series representation of an inner form of GL_n(F) an endo-class over F.

{"identifier":2782174,"ep:Repository":124,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Identification and Characterization of MtoA: A Decaheme c-Type Cytochrome of the Neutrophilic Fe(II)-Oxidizing Bacterium Sideroxydans lithotrophicus ES-1","bibo:abstract":"The Gram-negative bacterium \u003ci\u003eSideroxydans lithotrophicus\u003c/i\u003e ES-1 (ES-1) grows on FeCO\u003csub\u003e3\u003c/sub\u003e or FeS at oxic–anoxic interfaces at circumneutral pH, and the ES-1-mediated Fe(II) oxidation occurs extracellularly. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ES-1’s ability to oxidize Fe(II) remain unknown. Survey of the ES-1 genome for candidate genes for microbial extracellular Fe(II) oxidation revealed that it contained a three-gene cluster encoding homologs of \u003ci\u003eShewanella oneidensis\u003c/i\u003e MR-1 (MR-1) MtrA, MtrB, and CymA that are involved in extracellular Fe(III) reduction. Homologs of MtrA and MtrB were also previously shown to be involved in extracellular Fe(II) oxidation by \u003ci\u003eRhodopseudomonas palustris\u003c/i\u003e TIE-1. To distinguish them from those found in MR-1, the identified homologs were named MtoAB and CymA\u003csub\u003eES-1\u003c/sub\u003e. Cloned \u003ci\u003emtoA\u003c/i\u003e partially complemented an MR-1 mutant without MtrA with regards to ferrihydrite reduction. Characterization of purified MtoA showed that it was a decaheme \u003ci\u003ec\u003c/i\u003e-type cytochrome and oxidized soluble Fe(II). Oxidation of Fe(II) by MtoA was pH- and Fe(II)-complexing ligand-dependent. Under conditions tested, MtoA oxidized Fe(II) from pH 7 to pH 9 with the optimal rate at pH 9. MtoA oxidized Fe(II) complexed with different ligands at different rates. The reaction rates followed the order Fe(II)Cl\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e \u0026gt;  Fe(II)–citrate \u0026gt; Fe(II)–NTA \u0026gt; Fe(II)–EDTA with the second-order rate constants ranging from 6.3 × 10\u003csup\u003e−3\u003c/sup\u003e μM\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e s\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e for oxidation of Fe(II)Cl\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e to 1.0 × 10\u003csup\u003e−3\u003c/sup\u003e μM\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e s\u003csup\u003e−1\u003c/sup\u003e for oxidation of Fe(II)–EDTA. Thermodynamic modeling showed that redox reaction rates for the different Fe(II)-complexes correlated with their respective estimated reaction-free energies. Collectively, these results demonstrate that MtoA is a functional Fe(II)-oxidizing protein that, by working in concert with MtoB and CymA\u003csub\u003eES-1\u003c/sub\u003e, may oxidize Fe(II) at the bacterial surface and transfer released electrons across the bacterial cell envelope to the quinone pool in the inner membrane during extracellular Fe(II) oxidation by ES-1.","bibo:AuthorList":["Liu, J","Wang, Z","Belchik, SM","Edwards, MJ","Liu, C","Kennedy, DW","Merkley, ED","Lipton, MS","Butt, JN","Richardson, DJ","Zachara, JM","Fredrickson, JK","Rosso, KM","Shi, L"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4870420,"sim:weight":0.625637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4875747,"sim:weight":0.579917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4876222,"sim:weight":0.57301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4875748,"sim:weight":0.564709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870419,"sim:weight":0.423924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4868971,"sim:weight":0.402582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870799,"sim:weight":0.268024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.267446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269539,"sim:weight":0.266826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146021,"sim:weight":0.239296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769050,"sim:weight":0.232686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4894185,"sim:weight":0.222433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.203992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777073,"sim:weight":0.200605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780582,"sim:weight":0.195828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870699,"sim:weight":0.144669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4873700,"sim:weight":0.134933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145712,"sim:weight":0.133923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43250,"sim:weight":0.133845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585842,"sim:weight":0.128488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The report consists of two parts: the first presents a conceptual discussion of “cluttering” of trade mark registers. The second part provides an exploratory empirical analysis of trade mark applications at the UK Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) and the European trade mark office (OHIM). This part contains results of a descriptive and an econometric analysis. According to our definition, cluttering arises where firms hold trade marks that are overly broad or unused raising search costs for later applicants. The report distinguishes between three mechanisms that can lead to cluttering. It also considers a series of mechanisms that work against cluttering. This discussion is based on a review of the previous literature. The tentative empirical evidence provided in the second part of the report suggests that trade marks are more frequently registered in several classes at the same time and also that firms in pharmaceuticals increasingly resort to multiple simultaneous applications to ensure that they will register at least one trade mark. There is also some evidence that firms seek to avoid mechanisms such as relative grounds examination which can prevent cluttering. Finally, we report direct survey-based evidence that applicants perceive cluttering to be a problem in specific fields and countries. However, our exploratory analysis does not provide strong evidence that cluttering has already become a systemic problem for the trade mark systems that is comparable to the\r\neffect of patent thickets for patent systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["von Graevenitz, Georg","Greenhalgh, Christine","Helmers, Christian","Schautschick, Philipp"],"dc:date":"2012-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46817,"sim:weight":0.343458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.315725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.310048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182215,"sim:weight":0.306478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090409,"sim:weight":0.302699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.301982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.298746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.294961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.288743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.288743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.288743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.288743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.288743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.288743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.288743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.288743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.288743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.288743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.288743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The latter can reduce the average\r\nintention to be entrepreneurial and yet be socially beneficial. This paper provides a model of learning in which\r\nentrepreneurship education generates signals to students. Drawing on the signals, students evaluate their aptitude\r\nfor entrepreneurial tasks. The model is tested using data from a compulsory entrepreneurship course. Using ex ante\r\nand ex post survey responses from students, we find that intentions to found decline somewhat although the course\r\nhas significant positive e�ects on students’ self-assessed entrepreneurial skills. The empirical analysis supports\r\nthe hypothesis that students receive informative signals and learn about their entrepreneurial aptitude.

It is shown that enlargement had a significant and quantitatively important effect on pharmaceutical firms’ incentives to clutter trade mark registers with trade marks they are unlikely to use.","bibo:AuthorList":["von Graevenitz, Georg"],"dc:date":"2012-01-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The objectives are as follows:\r\n\r\nTo determine the diagnostic accuracy of state, minimally invasive clinical and physical signs (or sets of signs) to be used as screening tests for detecting impending or current water-loss dehydration, or both, in older people by systematically reviewing studies that have measured a reference standard and at least one index test in people aged 65 years and over.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo assess the effect of different cut offs of index test results assessed using continuous data on sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of impending or current water-loss dehydration.\r\n\r\nTo identify clinical and physical signs that may be used in screening for impending or current water-loss dehydration in older people.\r\n\r\nTo identify clinical and physical signs that are not useful in screening for impending or current water-loss dehydration in older people.\r\n\r\nTo directly compare promising index tests (sensitivity ≥ 0.60 and specificity ≥ 0.75) where two or more are measured in a single study (direct comparison).\r\n\r\nTo carry out an exploratory analysis to assess the value of combining the best three index tests where the three tests each have some predictive ability of their own, and individual studies include participants who had all three tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will explore sources of heterogeneity of diagnostic accuracy of individual clinical and physical signs that show some evidence of discrimination by the reference standard used, cut off value for tests providing continuous data, type of participants (community-dwelling older people, those in residential care, and those in hospital), sex, and baseline prevalence of dehydration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hooper, L","Attreed, NJ","Campbell, WW","Channell, AM","Chassagne, P","Culp, KR","Fletcher, SJ","Fuller, N","Gaspar, PM","Gilbert, DJ","Heathcote, AC","Lindner, G","Mack, GW","Mentes, JC","Needham, RA","Olde Rikkert, MGM","Ranson, SC","Ritz, P","Rowat, AM","Smith, AC","Stookey, JJD","Thomas, DR","Wakefield, BJ","Ward, S","Potter, JF","Hunter, PR"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.24354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99220,"sim:weight":0.237409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99012,"sim:weight":0.227393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85277,"sim:weight":0.226788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764248,"sim:weight":0.215798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25869,"sim:weight":0.210638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.209879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99063,"sim:weight":0.209506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49805,"sim:weight":0.20749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709866,"sim:weight":0.204532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49204,"sim:weight":0.200627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779686,"sim:weight":0.196256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145722,"sim:weight":0.193249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23711,"sim:weight":0.193229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.190992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101469,"sim:weight":0.190183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351718,"sim:weight":0.187091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42189,"sim:weight":0.182473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9028213,"sim:weight":0.168504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229591,"sim:weight":0.164837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2782490,"ep:Repository":124,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Effects of psychotherapy for anxiety in children and adolescents: A meta-analytic review.","bibo:abstract":"This paper provides a comprehensive quantitative review of high quality randomized controlled trials of psychological therapies for anxiety disorders in children and young people. Using a systematic search for randomized controlled trials which included a control condition and reported data suitable for meta-analysis, 55 studies were included. Eligible studies were rated for methodological quality and outcome data were extracted and analyzed using standard methods. Trial quality was variable, many studies were underpowered and adverse effects were rarely assessed; however, quality ratings were higher for more recently published studies. Most trials evaluated cognitive behavior therapy or behavior therapy and most recruited both children and adolescents. Psychological therapy for anxiety in children and young people was moderately effective overall, but effect sizes were small to medium when psychological therapy was compared to an active control condition. The effect size for non-CBT interventions was not significant. Parental involvement in therapy was not associated with differential effectiveness. Treatment targeted at specific anxiety disorders, individual psychotherapy, and psychotherapy with older children and adolescents had effect sizes which were larger than effect sizes for treatments targeting a range of anxiety disorders, group psychotherapy, and psychotherapy with younger children. Few studies included an effective follow-up. Future studies should follow CONSORT reporting standards, be adequately powered, and assess follow-up. Research trials are unlikely to address all important clinical questions around treatment delivery. Thus, careful assessment and formulation will remain an essential part of successful psychological treatment for anxiety in children and young people.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reynolds, SA","Wilson, Charlotte","Austin, Jo","Hooper, L"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":82102,"sim:weight":0.444833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18103,"sim:weight":0.380257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9038097,"sim:weight":0.369249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2753332,"sim:weight":0.326365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49361,"sim:weight":0.31994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9016274,"sim:weight":0.304924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145722,"sim:weight":0.298426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780479,"sim:weight":0.293868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181119,"sim:weight":0.29337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46759,"sim:weight":0.290832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83505,"sim:weight":0.288571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46468,"sim:weight":0.285292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158045,"sim:weight":0.27156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.270612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.266254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157521,"sim:weight":0.265537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384639,"sim:weight":0.253221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8747712,"sim:weight":0.253193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43246,"sim:weight":0.24919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.242336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article traces the coverage of the Black Swan controversy in order to demonstrate that press discourses surrounding the costume designer perform a series of cultural functions, often having a somewhat detrimental effect on the cultural legitimacy of costume design. Drawing on recent work in the field of feminist production studies, I seek to contribute to the body of work which examines theories of professional identity. Consequently, I argue that the coverage of Westcott\u0027s response to initial reports was framed in such a way as to re-establish these traditional value systems upon which economic structures for production are based. As such, I demonstrate that the press discourses surrounding the Black Swan controversy perpetuate certain problematic assumptions in respect to gender, labour and authorship.","bibo:AuthorList":["Warner, Helen"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2777917,"sim:weight":0.309829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780835,"sim:weight":0.264835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381933,"sim:weight":0.235844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771695,"sim:weight":0.227144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187501,"sim:weight":0.204686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352132,"sim:weight":0.203801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.198731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445178,"sim:weight":0.187371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1636074,"sim:weight":0.185229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58888,"sim:weight":0.185096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.18223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.181905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.17934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197556,"sim:weight":0.17878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109250,"sim:weight":0.177752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46639,"sim:weight":0.171563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634700,"sim:weight":0.167106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.164554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351922,"sim:weight":0.163557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47204,"sim:weight":0.162106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

[19699. Fama , E. , Fisher , L. , Jensen , M. and Roll , R. 1969 . The adjustment of stock prices to new information . International Economic Review , 10 ( 1 ) : 1 – 21 . [CrossRef] View all references. The adjustment of stock prices to new information. International Economic Review 10, no. 1: 1–21] to segregate a stock\u0027s return into expected and unexpected components. Moreover, conventional practice assumes that abnormal returns evolve in terms of a normal distribution. There is, however, an increasing tendency for event studies to employ non-parametric testing procedures due to the mounting empirical evidence which shows that stock returns are incompatible with the normal distribution. This paper focuses on the widely used non-parametric ranking procedure developed by Corrado [19896. Corrado , C. 1989 . A nonparametric test for abnormal security price performance in event studies . Journal of Financial Economics , 23 ( 2 ) : 385 – 95 . [CrossRef], [Web of Science ®] View all references. A nonparametric test for abnormal security price performance in event studies. Journal of Financial Economics 23, no. 2: 385–95] for assessing the significance of abnormal security returns. In particular, we develop a consistent estimator for the variance of the sum of ranks of the abnormal returns, and show how this leads to a more efficient test statistic (as well as to less cumbersome computational procedures) than the test originally proposed by Corrado (19896. Corrado , C. 1989 . A nonparametric test for abnormal security price performance in event studies . Journal of Financial Economics , 23 ( 2 ) : 385 – 95 . [CrossRef], [Web of Science ®] View all references). We also use the theorem of Berry [19413. Berry , A. 1941 . The accuracy of the Gaussian approximation to the sum of independent variates .

Fourier analysis of distribution functions: A mathematical study of the Laplace–Gaussian law. Acta Mathematica 77, no. 1: 1–125] to demonstrate how the distribution of the modified Corrado test statistic developed here asymptotically converges towards the normal distribution. This shows that describing the distributional properties of the sum of the ranks in terms of the normal distribution is highly problematic for small sample sizes and small event windows. In these circumstances, we show that a second-order Edgeworth expansion provides a good approximation to the actual probability distribution of the modified Corrado test statistic. The application of the modified Corrado test developed here is illustrated using data for the purchase and sale by UK directors of shares in their own companies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ataullah, Ali","Song, Xiaojing","Tippett, Mark"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103146,"sim:weight":0.401313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133995,"sim:weight":0.392378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1057383,"sim:weight":0.388636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99039,"sim:weight":0.370591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45926,"sim:weight":0.363084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.351966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1038402,"sim:weight":0.336375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664724,"sim:weight":0.334575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46982,"sim:weight":0.332074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.326833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.323294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381936,"sim:weight":0.323055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18129,"sim:weight":0.322472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45188,"sim:weight":0.318314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4896009,"sim:weight":0.316941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85602,"sim:weight":0.306959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.30667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45192,"sim:weight":0.306538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154347,"sim:weight":0.305445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108312,"sim:weight":0.302396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, it remains unclear what may trigger a Madden–Julian (MJ) event which is not immediately preceded by any MJO activity: a ‘primary’ MJ event. A combination of case-studies and composite analysis is used to examine the extent to which the triggering of primary MJ events might occur in response to ocean dynamics. The case-studies show that such events can be triggered by the arrival of a downwelling oceanic equatorial Rossby wave, which is shown to be associated with a deepening of the mixed layer and positive sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies of the order of 0.5–1 °C. These SST anomalies are not attributable to forcing by surface fluxes which are weak for the case-studies analysed. Furthermore, composite analysis suggests that such forcing is consistently important for triggering primary events. The relationship is much weaker for successive events, due to the many other triggering mechanisms which operate during periods of cyclical MJO activity. This oceanic feedback mechanism is a viable explanation for the sporadic and broadband nature of the MJO. Additionally, it provides hope for forecasting MJ events during periods of inactivity, when MJO forecasts generally exhibit low skill.","bibo:AuthorList":["Webber, BGM","Matthews, AJ","Heywood, KJ","Stevens, DP"],"dc:date":"2012-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2782731,"sim:weight":0.380732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Results are based on responses to photographic and computer-generated images as the crops are still relatively scarce in the landscape. A questionnaire survey indicated little public concern about potential landscape aesthetics but more concern about attendant built infrastructure. Focus group meetings and interviews indicated support for biomass end uses that bring direct benefits to local communities. Questions arise as to how well the imagery used was able to portray the true nature of these tall, dense, perennial plants but based on the responses obtained and given the caveat that there was limited personal experience of the crops, it appears unlikely that wide-scale planting of biomass crops will give rise to substantial public concern in relation to their visual impact in the landscape.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dockerty, T","Appleton, K","Lovett, AA"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A major problem in the area is the lack of a specific framework to support measurement and analyses of performance aspects concerning border-crossing operations. The purpose of this study was to develop a framework for the area comprising strategic performance objectives of operations.\r\n\r\nDesign/methodology/approach – The framework derived from a theoretical and empirical basis. The empirical method involved a Delphi study with 11 experts with recognised knowledge in the area of international logistics and supply chain. The framework was validated through a substantive validity test conducted in a pilot study with 20 managers from organisations operating in a major international seaport overseas.\r\n\r\nFindings – The study developed a framework structured by critical operations performance factors operationalised in terms of trade and transport facilitation aspects.\r\nResearch limitations/implications – The framework was pre-tested in a specific context in Brazil. Its construct validity and reliability require further testing and refinement.\r\n\r\nPractical implications – The framework provides reference for the definition of priorities and targeted initiatives in specific areas of trade and transport operations at border-crossing levels. The initiatives can be aligned with relevant strategic performance objectives of operations in general.\r\n\r\nOriginality/value – The theoretical, empirical, and practical issues addressed in the research provide an insightful basis for future research and managerial initiatives.

As illustration, we comment on the findings of a case study we have conducted in a Local Authority in the United Kingdom (UK). Our findings show that local government managers might be struggling to adequately implement Freedom of Information and Data Protection aspects.

They draw aspects from both theories that can enable the building and management of corporate reputation in the public sector with the support of CRM solutions. \r\n\r\nFindings – Challenging the popular criticism that most public agencies and departments are bureaucratic, slow, and incapable of taking immediate action, governments are striving to revert this negative image by adopting new business approaches and applying new information technologies to optimize their processes. In this context, CRM has a potential value to fulfil government needs to become more responsive to the public. \r\n\r\nPractical implications – The considerations raised in this paper provide relevant issues for future research aimed at studying CRM and reputation in the government context. Public managers may benefit from the practical aspects and cases provided in this paper. \r\n\r\nOriginality/value – A theoretical link is developed between CRM and corporate reputation, bringing a new dimension to the matter. Many public managers are leading projects to adopt customer-focused strategies without realizing they are also working on government reputation. An attempt is made to bring this awareness to the surface by linking some aspects of corporate reputation theory with CRM.

In this context, then, what are the risks of e-voting to democracy? In what ways, if at all, can more fragile, less mature democracies be buttressed with e-voting systems? As a key\r\ncomponent of e-democracy, it seems that e-voting technologies are to become more secure and increasingly reliable in the near future and will indeed be adopted in many countries. In what ways, if at all, will the introduction of such systems increase voter confidence in the political system, promote citizen engagement in political life, and nurture the evolution of democracy? If both e-voting and e-democracy\r\nare emerging based on popular demand - that is, as a demand-driven alternative to current processes, then there is no doubt that they are likely to enhance and improve the efficiency of traditional democracy. However, if e-voting\r\ntechnology is being introduced based on a supply-driven fashion - the technology exists therefore it should and must be implemented - then the implications for democracy should be considered. Brazil’s introduction of e-voting offers a cautionary tale of supply-driven technological implication. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how the introduction of e-voting in Brazil is highly risky to democracy due to the lack of emphasis on security and the lack of a sociallyinformed\r\nand socially driven approach to technological innovation. The Brazilian example illustrates the democratic implications of a market-driven approach. The lack of a technology strategy designed to promote and extend democratic principles is not surprising given the closed door, market-based negotiations that led to the adoption of e-voting in Brazil. The promise, and indeed, the imperative of a democratic, voter-centered approach as an alternative for the development of an electronic voting system, is explored in the paper.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rodrigues-Filho, Jose","Alexander, Cynthia","Batista, Luciano"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1916,"sim:weight":0.84347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090413,"sim:weight":0.337254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.256336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.255937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090466,"sim:weight":0.255919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.248647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43716,"sim:weight":0.241968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47192,"sim:weight":0.239662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.239249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.238846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309239,"sim:weight":0.236848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.23565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.23565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.23565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.23565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.23565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.23565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.23565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.23565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.23565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In order to achieve a thorough understanding of customers, companies are increasingly adopting Customer Relationship Management (CRM) initiatives. However, CRM does not have the process vision necessary to cope with complex and cross-functional processes. This problem is better handled by Business Process Management (BPM) initiatives, which, by their turn, struggle to built-in customer intelligence in their systems. Based upon systems theory, we discuss the roles of CRM and BPM in an integrated approach to deliver customer fulfillment. As the evolution of service-oriented approaches requires us to consider both customer interactions and experiences as key elements of service processes, we present a broader perception of service processes involving these two perspectives. Also, we discuss the architecture of a customer-facing system comprising customer processes that are aimed at better dealing with customer interactions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Batista, Luciano","Smart, Andy","Maull, Roger"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Finding ways of involving the parts of a supply chain system in synergistic relationships aimed at minimising the overall impact of the whole system on the environment is likely to achieve better results than each part trying to do its best in isolation.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of sustainable practices in supply chains is a daunting task. Even when players in the supply system try to be consistent, it is very difficult to do it at a global level. This implies that to integrate sustainability in supply chains it is imperative to understand the mutual relationships among the players in the supply system. Moreover, the ecological paradigm for supply chain management demands extended integration of sustainability values, where responsible management is a key function.\r\n\r\nTo delimit the discussion, the paper will focus upon the food supply chain. The environmental and social consequences of the food industry and its supply chain activities represent a global challenge which requires innovative sustainable practices that are effectively achievable to the organisations involved. The food sector as a whole faces considerable challenges imposed by the limited availability of arable land and natural resources for food production on the one hand, and the continuous increase of food consumption dictated by the exponential growth of populations and livestock on the other hand. In 2008, the Cabinet Office pointed out the pressures of climate change on food production and the impact of food chains on the environment as some of the major challenges which need to be addressed before long.\r\n\r\nIn general, the paper will critically discuss and identify potential links that can integrate cross-industry processes through the application of industrial symbiosis concepts and practices. The managerial implications here addressed will consider how organisations involved in a food supply chain system can get engaged in symbiotic relationships that can potentially improve not only their own environmental sustainability performance, but also the performance of the supply chain system they are part of.","bibo:AuthorList":["Batista, Luciano"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103310,"sim:weight":0.322737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.308055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664638,"sim:weight":0.306498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664632,"sim:weight":0.305837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67390,"sim:weight":0.303657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91147,"sim:weight":0.301785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.299773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Trade and transport facilitation (TTF) measures and instruments are seen as important initiatives to smooth the progress of trade volumes. The measurement of TTF performance provides the basis for the development of initiatives aimed at accelerating the flow of goods across borders as well as optimising customs processes. A major problem is that the lack of consensus on the definition and characterization of performance factors for TTF makes it difficult for policymakers and private sector stakeholders to adequately assess the constraints they face in connecting to global markets (Raven 2001). This study focuses upon operational aspects of TTF. Its main purpose is to identify factors that represent key operations performance aspects of TTF systems.\r\n\r\nResearch approach: \r\nThe research approach used to identify key TTF performance factors was Delphi study. This method is considered to obtain reliable consensus on complex issues from a group of experts. It is an exercise of group communication interspersed with controlled opinion feedback involving a panel of geographically dispersed experts. In order to avoid influences, the group interaction in Delphi is anonymous. A knowledgeable group of academics, consultants, and practitioners with large experience in the area of global logistics and supply chain management formed the group of experts in this study. \r\n\r\nFindings and Originality:\r\nThis paper reports the findings of a Delphi study involved in a research project funded by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) UK. Critical operations performance elements such as speed, dependability, flexibility, quality, and cost provided the basis for the categorization of the key TTF performance factors identified in the study. Those performance elements are well established performance aspects in the operations management discipline. This classification framework provides clarification, sound referential basis, and a more structured and consistent way to represent key performance factors on TTF operations.\r\n\r\nResearch impact:\r\nThe categorization of TTF operations performance factors in terms of speed, dependability, flexibility, quality, and cost provides a useful framework for the development of comparative studies involving regional and global analyses. The study also addresses issues regarding the ownership of TTF operations and the holistic perspective of TTF systems, which normally comprise a group of private and public organisations providing border and customs services involved in international trade. The considerations made around these issues might be particularly insightful for studies concerned with TTF.\r\n\r\nPractical impact:\r\nProper identification of critical operations performance elements is of crucial importance for the implementation of productive systems. The fundamental performance objectives that apply to all types of organisations, and are closely related to customer satisfaction requirements, are speed, dependability, flexibility, quality, and cost. Using these elements as a basis for the categorization of key performance factors of TTF systems facilitates benchmarking and provides clearer reference for assessment processes. This classification framework can also be used to monitor projects and support structured comparisons of the operations performance of TTF systems in different crossing-borders or countries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Batista, Luciano"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4551,"sim:weight":0.514394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.256097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44928,"sim:weight":0.246923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.240559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664678,"sim:weight":0.237227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387205,"sim:weight":0.229028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.214292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

On the one hand, the advent of Corporate Reputation theory shows that reputation can be enhanced through better management of the interactions between customers and customer-facing employees. On the other hand, the adoption of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions enables a closer relationship\r\nbetween customer-facing employees and customers regardless of the channel of interaction. In this paper we draw from both theories aspects that can enable the building and management of corporate reputation in the public sector with the support of CRM solutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["da Silva, Rui","Batista, Luciano"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The cognisance of public opinion is a fundamental requisite for improving government responsiveness, which is more than merely reacting to popular demands. Responsiveness also means that government takes the initiative in the proposal of solutions for previously identified problems. The collection of information about the public’s needs, wants and preferences enhances government responsiveness by allowing government executives to develop the expertise needed to create effective programs. Developing good relationships with the public is no longer a matter restricted to public relations strategies and policy developments. It requires a stronger customer-focused orientation, a better government performance of day-to-day management and operational activities, and more efficient and effective communication with the public.","bibo:AuthorList":["Batista, Luciano"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1917,"sim:weight":0.441119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664705,"sim:weight":0.39966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764391,"sim:weight":0.380015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930155,"sim:weight":0.324291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664675,"sim:weight":0.303789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43987,"sim:weight":0.280351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709922,"sim:weight":0.272401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090812,"sim:weight":0.266827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157593,"sim:weight":0.264355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664585,"sim:weight":0.245562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155990,"sim:weight":0.234853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.218795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.218795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.218795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.218795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.218795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.218795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.218795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.218795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.218795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Do they jointly impact responsiveness capabilities of an organisation?\r\n\r\nThis research expands knowledge in the area by presenting a holistic perspective integrating aspects of customer-oriented strategies, system effectiveness, and staff empowerment initiatives, shedding light on the linkages between these fundamental elements of CRM implementation and the overall impact on organisational responsiveness.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we report the initial findings of an empirical study of CRM implementation by financial institutions in Brazil.

Two pricing techniques – time and material and fixed price – are described and the economic conditions for selecting between them are discussed. Using agency theory and transaction cost economics, it is predicted that risky and specific systems will be priced on time and material basis while other projects will be fixed price. An additional prediction is that confidence in the vendor’s auditing of resources is essential for time and material contracts. The predictions are tested on fourteen external software development projects in two large corporations. Quantitative measures of risk, specificity and confidence are utilised, but the data-set does not support the theoretical predictions. In order to explain this result, interviews with senior managers at the two corporations have been conducted. Both disagree with the theoretical prescriptions: one contracts risky projects on fixed price basis, preferring to pay a risk-premium rather than to rebudget. The second expert allows fixed price only with trusted vendors, preferring time and material with all other vendors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lichtenstein, Yossi","McDonnell, A."],"dc:date":"2003-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381980,"sim:weight":0.451968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.440459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.4372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.428358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666302,"sim:weight":0.415601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.40468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48424,"sim:weight":0.404417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.404391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.404141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.39615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.392131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.392131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.392131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.392131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.392131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.392131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.392131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.392131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.392131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.392131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The current study complements this literature by considering a wide set of IS projects and assessing, albeit crudely, their optional value. We test the literature’s assumption that IS projects embed significant optional value. Our research site is a European plant of a leading multinational manufacturer of sophisticated products. The portfolio of current and recent IS projects is studied through a questionnaire administered to all project managers. Seventeen project managers were interviewed concerning thirty-one projects with median cost of $325k and median benefit of $1.2m. We find strong support to the prediction that IS projects include considerable optional value. The thirty one projects we studied embed forty seven options, many of them with benefits comparable to the value of the original projects. Only four projects had no optional value. A comparison between a subset of the portfolio and the corresponding scale-up options shows that the exercise price of the options is 20% of the original projects’ cost, and that the value of these options is about 70% of the original projects’ value. This data also demonstrates the large return, of scale-up options – the median return is 1500%, five fold the median return of projects. The main practical implication of this study is that real option evaluation is useful for IS projects in general, and should not be confined to special cases. A further implication is that real option thinking may be of particular value in recognising reduction and deferral options. The project managers in our study found such options difficult to identify and considered their time to expiration as relatively short. Proactive management of reduction and deferral options should thus increase the flexibility and value of IS projects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kenneally, J.","Lichtenstein, Yossi"],"dc:date":"2002-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This paper uses three rounds of panel data and life histories collected by Young Lives, a longitudinal study of childhood poverty, to identify factors that contribute to households becoming or remaining poor in rural Ethiopia, with related effects on the children within those households. It combines a case-centred and a variable-centred approach (Ragin, 1987), analysing and comparing the experiences of individual households on the basis of qualitative and quantitative techniques and interrogating these findings by looking at attributes of households (variables) across a larger sample. The substantive findings on poverty ‘drivers’ and ‘maintainers’ (Baulch, 2011) support those of previous studies: rainfall, illness, debt, exclusion from the main form of social protection. But by mixing different types of data and analysis, the paper was able to show that combinations of factors rather than single events drive households into poverty, and that household characteristics can play an important factor. The primary contribution of the paper is methodological as it presents a novel method of using life histories to investigate chronic poverty in rural Ethiopia by generating or testing hypotheses/findings on poverty drivers and maintainers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Camfield, Laura","Roelen, Keetie"],"dc:date":"2012-08-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2781857,"sim:weight":0.520364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709270,"sim:weight":0.506783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101196,"sim:weight":0.428425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146073,"sim:weight":0.412688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387417,"sim:weight":0.400941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187739,"sim:weight":0.389935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160281,"sim:weight":0.379538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710179,"sim:weight":0.316713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95974,"sim:weight":0.308284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584822,"sim:weight":0.306062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156428,"sim:weight":0.301494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710013,"sim:weight":0.262163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767999,"sim:weight":0.25918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13224,"sim:weight":0.228458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176851,"sim:weight":0.227129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710558,"sim:weight":0.224936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778813,"sim:weight":0.21904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.21671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154362,"sim:weight":0.208493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158927,"sim:weight":0.199741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This inequality affects participants’ material and subjective wellbeing, their aspirations, and the extent to which they feel these are realised. The paper argues that adaptation, expressed as reduced aspirations, could explain why the effect of material poverty on people’s satisfaction with their lives is small. The reduction in attainment of aspirations linked to socio-economic status suggests that a small, but constant group of people are being excluded from a shift in the societal consensus over what constitutes a good life.","bibo:AuthorList":["Camfield, Laura","Masae, Awae","McGregor, J.

It has a \u0027lighter touch\u0027 regulatory regime which has made it more attractive for companies seeking their first listing, or companies seeking an overseas listing in a well-respected market.\r\n\r\nUsing a sample of 300 financial reports and accounts of AIM companies, we carry out regression analysis which indicates that age, company size, board size and the presence of turnover (i.e. the company is active) are positively associated with the adoption, and disclosure, of recommended governance practice. Our study also reveals that more highly geared AIM companies tend to make less disclosure. Overall, our findings suggest that the internal dynamics of AIM companies exert a greater influence on voluntary corporate governance disclosures than do market-related factors.\r\n\r\nWe contribute to the literature on AIM companies and corporate governance in two main ways. First, we provide evidence on the extent of disclosure of corporate governance by AIM companies, an area where research has been largely absent. Secondly, we provide some insights into which company-level and market-related variables may be significant to corporate governance disclosure.\r\n\r\nOur findings have implications not just for the UK but also for overseas companies listed on AIM, and for countries who either have, or are considering introducing, a similar market.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mallin, Christine","Ow-Yong, Kean"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108532,"sim:weight":0.574151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":211242,"sim:weight":0.54441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734375,"sim:weight":0.524694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85702,"sim:weight":0.517542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.517415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47250,"sim:weight":0.512987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.499759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269870,"sim:weight":0.481426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101265,"sim:weight":0.477644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1037193,"sim:weight":0.465532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103050,"sim:weight":0.463044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316147,"sim:weight":0.426516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98926,"sim:weight":0.412784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.395825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109146,"sim:weight":0.383175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":685093,"sim:weight":0.377432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382033,"sim:weight":0.36832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664701,"sim:weight":0.358218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316064,"sim:weight":0.354171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46861,"sim:weight":0.347031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Lack of monitoring data and poorly understood species ecology limit knowledge of patterns,\r\ncausal mechanisms and degree of abundance or range declines. Working in an African savanna, where bushmeat hunting and cattle-grazing are considered the greatest threats to wildlife, this thesis combined three approaches to study the conservation ecology of widely distributed wildlife at three spatial scales (continent-wide; landscape; home range). The continent-wide conservation status of Kori Bustard Ardeotis kori was assessed by reviewing occurrence records (1863–2009) across its range (14 countries). Range contraction was quantified by examining the proportion of historical records\r\n(pre-1970) falling within the area delineated by recent records (1970–2009), finding 8% (southern) and 21% (East Africa) declines in 146 years. In contrast, qualitative evidence from historical published accounts and contemporary expert assessments suggested widespread declines in abundance; thus numbers have declined considerably but without commensurate range contraction. Examination of seasonal home range use using satellite telemetry showed that female Kori are sedentary in central Botswana,with strong site-fidelity to dry-season home ranges associated with resource-rich pan habitats; the species appears sensitive to localised habitat conditions and resource availability. However, an assessment of the differential response of Kori and 20 other large-bodied vertebrates to protected areas, wildlife management areas and unprotected areas showed most species’ abundance was driven by proximity to human settlement,interpreted as sensitivity to unregulated hunting, with no effect of differential cattle stocking densities. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that cattle can affect habitat\r\nstructure, but their effects on Kalahari wildlife were not perceptible, suggesting that conservationists’ preoccupation in African savannas with cattle and their perceived impacts rather than unregulated hunting may be misplaced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Senyatso, Kabelo"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86207,"sim:weight":0.309408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780344,"sim:weight":0.300346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15174,"sim:weight":0.259684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.256702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62227,"sim:weight":0.254782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769014,"sim:weight":0.227366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.225507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108959,"sim:weight":0.217842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731197,"sim:weight":0.213467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62510,"sim:weight":0.210373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97600,"sim:weight":0.205447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145934,"sim:weight":0.205297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145646,"sim:weight":0.198359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.198178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.198178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768015,"sim:weight":0.188049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3152,"sim:weight":0.182525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.182148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.18026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664632,"sim:weight":0.179069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Our empirical analysis is based on a theoretical model of patenting in complex and discrete technologies. The model cap- tures how competition for patent portfolios and complementarity of patents affect patent- ing incentives. We show that lower technological opportunities increase patenting in- centives in complex technologies while they decrease incentives in discrete technologies. Also, more competitors increase patenting incentives in complex technologies and reduce them in discrete technologies. To test these predictions a new measure of the density of patent thickets is introduced. European patent citations are used to construct measures of fragmentation and technological opportunity. Our empirical analysis is based on a panel capturing patenting behavior of 2074 firms in 30 technology areas over 15 years. GMM estimation results confirm the predictions of our theoretical model. The results show that patent thickets exist in 9 out of 30 technology areas. We find that decreased technological opportunities are a surprisingly strong driver of patent thicket growth.","bibo:AuthorList":["Von Graevenitz, Georg","Wagner, Stefan","Harhoff, Dietmar"],"dc:date":"2012-07-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2781878,"sim:weight":0.687018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2781879,"sim:weight":0.67086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2782468,"sim:weight":0.559641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930076,"sim:weight":0.511022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5083714,"sim:weight":0.47134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5084095,"sim:weight":0.465871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95308,"sim:weight":0.445807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46817,"sim:weight":0.434408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95597,"sim:weight":0.424025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1456,"sim:weight":0.421694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93461,"sim:weight":0.409496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93462,"sim:weight":0.335399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999732,"sim:weight":0.309342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2781881,"sim:weight":0.299117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271176,"sim:weight":0.279983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2781873,"sim:weight":0.274249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94018,"sim:weight":0.261448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998565,"sim:weight":0.259387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94012,"sim:weight":0.255872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930061,"sim:weight":0.236659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, such challenges will only be initiated if the (expected) private gains from challenging a granted patent right exceed the respective costs. Two important aspects may influence the likelihood of challenges. First, there is a public goods problem: firms may refrain from challenges if they anticipate that others will also benefit from the revocation of a weak patent. Second, as more firms are caught up in patent thickets, challenges to weak patents will become too costly as they invite counter-challenges. We use data on opposition proceedings initiated against patents granted at the European Patent Office (EPO) to study the importance of these mechanisms. This paper identifies a significant increase in the incidence of opposition in technical fields characterized by high concentration of patent ownership. Additionally, in fields with a large number of mutually blocking patents, the incidence of opposition is sharply reduced, particularly amongst those firms that are caught up in and driving the growth of patent thickets. Thus, while post-grant reviews may help to resolve problems in some areas, they are less suited to deal with patent thickets and contexts with dispersed patent ownership. We discuss the implications of these results for efforts to deal with patent thickets and weak patents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harhoff, Dietmar","Von Graevenitz, Georg","Wagner, Stefan"],"dc:date":"2012-04-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2782468,"sim:weight":0.655889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5075003,"sim:weight":0.632594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5083714,"sim:weight":0.6273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95308,"sim:weight":0.619858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5084095,"sim:weight":0.603696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082821,"sim:weight":0.59641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95174,"sim:weight":0.573335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5086422,"sim:weight":0.569321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46817,"sim:weight":0.557166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082137,"sim:weight":0.511255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082827,"sim:weight":0.500337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2781879,"sim:weight":0.478128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386519,"sim:weight":0.460891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386978,"sim:weight":0.377823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2781881,"sim:weight":0.341271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94012,"sim:weight":0.335703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2781873,"sim:weight":0.326298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46946,"sim:weight":0.321291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586184,"sim:weight":0.224071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2782461,"sim:weight":0.168166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

New data on the appointment of chief executives of these agencies is used to create a proxy for the actual independence of agencies from politics. The analysis demonstrates that formal independence is an important determinant of actual independence, but the rule of law and the number of veto players matter as well.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hanretty, Chris","Koop, Christel"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5080608,"sim:weight":0.295352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5080628,"sim:weight":0.275131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99191,"sim:weight":0.230456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":92420,"sim:weight":0.226381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5086520,"sim:weight":0.20159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447705,"sim:weight":0.198558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709549,"sim:weight":0.194311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5076857,"sim:weight":0.193029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187761,"sim:weight":0.191627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43534,"sim:weight":0.185076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108998,"sim:weight":0.181952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.181212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43838,"sim:weight":0.180141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187618,"sim:weight":0.176274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709929,"sim:weight":0.175259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5081722,"sim:weight":0.173719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090466,"sim:weight":0.165314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5079725,"sim:weight":0.164491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930824,"sim:weight":0.164221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47362,"sim:weight":0.15774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article argues that this neglect has been benign, because explanations of judicial decisions in terms of the positions of individual judges fare poorly in the British case. To support this argument, the non-unanimous opinions of British Law Lords between 1969 and 2009 are analysed. A hierarchical item-response model of individual judges’ votes is estimated in order to identify judges’ locations along a one-dimensional policy space. Such a model is found to be no better than a null model that predicts that every judge will vote with the majority with the same probability. Locations generated by the model do not represent judges’ political attitudes, only their propensity to dissent. Consequently, judges’ individual votes should not be used to describe them in political terms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hanretty, Chris"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1587178,"sim:weight":0.504418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5079694,"sim:weight":0.394346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":291182,"sim:weight":0.335646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360836,"sim:weight":0.327663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108998,"sim:weight":0.251881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101374,"sim:weight":0.224941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710069,"sim:weight":0.218414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1388248,"sim:weight":0.215423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108597,"sim:weight":0.211554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15217,"sim:weight":0.204128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84868,"sim:weight":0.197785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187748,"sim:weight":0.19003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090466,"sim:weight":0.189838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187811,"sim:weight":0.185839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45050,"sim:weight":0.184466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101247,"sim:weight":0.183472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709925,"sim:weight":0.180198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154411,"sim:weight":0.178447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090413,"sim:weight":0.178178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109014,"sim:weight":0.178068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Yet, the myriad of recent business model developments in the sector depicts a disorderly environment lacking frameworks and typologies to facilitate understanding and explain different business propositions. In this paper, we report the preliminary findings of a work-in-progress study being developed in the fashion retail sector. Initial analysis showed a regular presence of relationship-based functionalities in current business models emerged in the electronic fashion retailing context. It is also possible to notice a widespread adoption of relationship-based functionalities across different business models in the sector. The models are presented under a conceptual framework developed to support and facilitate understanding of the core functionalities they implement. Furthermore, the study also identified click-and-mortar initiatives where fashion retailers integrate online relationship-based functionalities into their conventional brick-and-mortar operations. An interesting aspect observed in the study is the augmented scope of the relationships that fashion retailers are now able to explore. This is mainly due to the positioning of customers’ social networks into the retailers’ reach by the customers themselves, who now have easy access to their social contacts from the online, and sometimes in-store, environments they are interacting with.","bibo:AuthorList":["Batista, Luciano","Ng, Irene"],"dc:date":"2012-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23097,"sim:weight":0.340885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4692,"sim:weight":0.318111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9430797,"sim:weight":0.279157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.273621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45808,"sim:weight":0.251873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664703,"sim:weight":0.23683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.230345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.222416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.222416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.222416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.222416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.222416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.222416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.222416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.222416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.222416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.222416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.222416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187641,"sim:weight":0.215343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664681,"sim:weight":0.21394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim is to contribute to our understanding of the role of patent thickets as a barrier to entry into patenting for UK enterprises, in particular small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). To do this we review the literature on patent thickets, discuss factors contributing to thicket formation and growth, and evaluate to what extent patent thickets might be considered to be barriers to entry in some technology areas. We also summarize the limited existing empirical evidence regarding effects of patent thickets on R\u0026D investments and competition. \r\n\r\nWe find overwhelming evidence in the literature that patent thickets arise in specific technology areas. This conclusion is based on a comprehensive review of the empirical literature on patent thickets of the last 15 years. This literature consists of surveys of firm representatives as well as of econometric analyses of firm level data. The literature on thickets contains more than 100 peer reviewed papers and a number of extensive studies undertaken by competition regulators.\r\n\r\nOur main contribution in this study consists of an empirical analysis of the effects of patent thickets at the European Patent Office on entry into patenting by UK firms. Using a new measure of patent thickets developed by Graevenitz et al. (2012), the report provides a descriptive analysis of the growth of patent thickets in the European patent system and an analysis of the exposure to these thickets of UK entrants into patenting.

This article considers how British film reviews from the 1950s and 1980s established potent terms of discussion around the 3-D technology, its potential aesthetic development, and the role of stereoscopy within cinema. Exploring the parameters that the original reviewers set in place concerning the 3-D aesthetic, notably claims around realism, novelty, and gimmickry, the article argues that the language and terms of 1950s British film reviewers have worked to set an agenda that resonates through both the 1980s 3-D revival and modern day digital 3-D.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnston, Keith M"],"dc:date":"2012-04-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47198,"sim:weight":0.397772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99117,"sim:weight":0.358744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48286,"sim:weight":0.339873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47288,"sim:weight":0.338036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931412,"sim:weight":0.334235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.324792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98567,"sim:weight":0.311571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99028,"sim:weight":0.306693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1344505,"sim:weight":0.306482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45332,"sim:weight":0.302492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45046,"sim:weight":0.299022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.296394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051961,"sim:weight":0.283415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709927,"sim:weight":0.281097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.280786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.279034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447850,"sim:weight":0.271781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98711,"sim:weight":0.26964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383083,"sim:weight":0.268537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.258309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Not only information on the distribution of aid resources through community-based schemes, but also information on who makes use of an available punishment mechanism through majority voting may be important. The main results are the following. First, many rich community representatives try to satisfy a political majority who would then abstain from using the punishment mechanism, and exclude those community members whose approval is then not required. The frequency of this exclusion strategy is highest with private information on the distribution and public voting. Second, when voting is public, responders are more reluctant to make use of the punishment mechanism, and representatives who follow the exclusion strategy are more inclined to exclude the poorest responder. Third, punishment is largely ineffective as it induces rich representatives to capture all economic resources. Fourth, if a poor agent takes the representative’s role, punishment rates drop, efficiency increases, and final distributions become more equal.","bibo:AuthorList":["D\u0027Exelle, Ben","Riedl, Arno"],"dc:date":"2008-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4156428,"sim:weight":0.262369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43845,"sim:weight":0.216407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5092455,"sim:weight":0.20989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664548,"sim:weight":0.202253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99470,"sim:weight":0.201699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773103,"sim:weight":0.19799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.197904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8792154,"sim:weight":0.196836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46592,"sim:weight":0.19528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.192463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710693,"sim:weight":0.191811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.191678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187716,"sim:weight":0.186914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46976,"sim:weight":0.18575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187723,"sim:weight":0.184984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090812,"sim:weight":0.181936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43753,"sim:weight":0.181376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95748,"sim:weight":0.178308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187811,"sim:weight":0.169906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.168316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This case study of housing policy in the borough of Brighton demonstrates that council house sales between the 1950s and 1970s were important in the residualization of inter-war estates well before the ‘right to buy’ legislation of the 1980s. Concerns about excessively affluent tenants can also be traced to the inter-war period, although it was not until the late 1950s that local Conservatives sought to push affluent council tenants into owner occupation via capping incomes and encouraging council house sales. The article shows that slum clearance had long been central to the local council’s provision of municipal housing and that apart from two short periods following the First and Second World Wars, council housing was conceived of primarily as a residual tenure by those in control of policy implementation. It further demonstrates that slum clearance between the 1920s and 1960s altered the social constituency for council housing and, combined with selective privatization, specific allocation policies and disinvestment, led to the stigmatization of certain inter-war estates. The article suggests that further case studies are needed in order to test the wider applicability of these arguments during the middle years of the twentieth century.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Benjamin"],"dc:date":"2010-12-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46289,"sim:weight":0.527486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187471,"sim:weight":0.459542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108867,"sim:weight":0.447055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586563,"sim:weight":0.417181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1396100,"sim:weight":0.411144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187461,"sim:weight":0.407955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5078805,"sim:weight":0.405625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3789,"sim:weight":0.401557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187646,"sim:weight":0.385078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382003,"sim:weight":0.380606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382083,"sim:weight":0.375925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99155,"sim:weight":0.374108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586181,"sim:weight":0.36542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46287,"sim:weight":0.359408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46839,"sim:weight":0.330571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763974,"sim:weight":0.330415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93931,"sim:weight":0.319451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98616,"sim:weight":0.287222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45306,"sim:weight":0.278535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85536,"sim:weight":0.269458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In contrast to case studies by other historians, it is argued here that gossip does appear to have been a peculiarly female activity, but far more than simply being an outlet for malice or prurience, it gave women a distinctive social role in the town. No less evident is the involvement of women in physical violence both against each other and against men, violence which, though less extreme than its male counterpart, nonetheless occupies a significant role in the proceedings of the consistories.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lipscomb, Suzannah"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383674,"sim:weight":0.355932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13235,"sim:weight":0.330568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87201,"sim:weight":0.308971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47200,"sim:weight":0.305112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.280302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316062,"sim:weight":0.278039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381919,"sim:weight":0.27177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108769,"sim:weight":0.259278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383575,"sim:weight":0.25894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176806,"sim:weight":0.258856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.245131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383350,"sim:weight":0.238489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383584,"sim:weight":0.233698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.232802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45198,"sim:weight":0.232135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.227602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764138,"sim:weight":0.226884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383660,"sim:weight":0.224264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383352,"sim:weight":0.222703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45520,"sim:weight":0.220805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The cross-cultural pragmatics perspective and focus on viewers’ reactions that dealing with representation entails cast the question of loss in a different light and opens up avenues for alternative modes of analysis. They make room for subtitles to be construed as producing their own systems of multimodal textual representation and modes of interpretation, and for their text to be recognised as having a greater expressive and representational potential than face values might suggest. This is the argument, informed by Fowler\u0027s Theory of Mode (1991, 2000), that is taken up in the paper, and harnessed to the review of examples or observations from recent studies on subtitles, and complementary evidence from dubbing. The capacity of subtitles to produce insights into the cultures and languages represented is of particular interest, and has wider implications for the culturally instrumental functions of subtitles and translation strategies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guillot, Marie-Noelle"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101188,"sim:weight":0.358849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.219638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176873,"sim:weight":0.217066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81502,"sim:weight":0.197945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.19621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352240,"sim:weight":0.194967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9432705,"sim:weight":0.191682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051961,"sim:weight":0.190949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99028,"sim:weight":0.189064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81499,"sim:weight":0.186339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.182174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.182138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634699,"sim:weight":0.176188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48395,"sim:weight":0.175251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101576,"sim:weight":0.171184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47058,"sim:weight":0.170657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.170375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.17024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664720,"sim:weight":0.169871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108274,"sim:weight":0.169794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the run up to and during the ‘anniversary year’ of 2009, German media, sports institutions and various other official institutions articulating tourist, economic and political interests attempted to create a new ‘glocalised’ version of the public memory of the Teutoburg battle. Combining methods of Cognitive Linguistics and Critical Discourse Analysis, the paper analyses the narrative and argumentative topoi employed in this re-orientation of public memory, with a special emphasis on hybrid, post-national identity-construction.\r\n\r\nDas zweitausendjährige Gedenkjahr der „Schlacht im Teutoburger Wald“ im Jahr 2009 bot eine günstige Gelegenheit, die bis in die zweite Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts dominante Tradition nationalistisch–chauvinistischer Deutungen des Sieges von germanischen Stämmen über drei römische Legionen zu korrigieren und zu überwinden. Der Aufsatz analysiert mit Hilfe diskurslinguistischer Methoden die Anstrengungen regionaler Institutionen und Medien, die nationale Vereinnahmung des historischen Gedenkens kritisch zu thematisieren sowie neue, zum eine lokal situierte, zum andern international orientierte Identifikationsangebote anzubieten. Die Analyse zeigt, dass solche „de-nationalisierten“ Identifikationsangebote zwar teilweise auch früher verwendet wurden, aber heutzutage rekontextualisiert und auf innovative Weise in den Vordergrund gestellt werden.","bibo:AuthorList":["Musolff, Andreas"],"dc:date":"2012-01-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":516176,"sim:weight":0.390551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":717385,"sim:weight":0.387657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":709620,"sim:weight":0.386977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108897,"sim:weight":0.380066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":709619,"sim:weight":0.378431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5086513,"sim:weight":0.377623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1008339,"sim:weight":0.375319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5507962,"sim:weight":0.374972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68487,"sim:weight":0.374433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49732,"sim:weight":0.374326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5075022,"sim:weight":0.373854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999443,"sim:weight":0.373537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5074997,"sim:weight":0.371639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":114467,"sim:weight":0.370915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1015855,"sim:weight":0.370353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5086523,"sim:weight":0.369524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5853412,"sim:weight":0.369266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090292,"sim:weight":0.368461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5084164,"sim:weight":0.367862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5075014,"sim:weight":0.364937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It shows how cognitive linguists’ recognition of metaphor as a fundamental means of concept- and argument-building can add to CDA\u0027s account of meaning constitution in the social context. It then discusses discrepancies between the early model of conceptual metaphor theory and empirical data and argues that discursive-pragmatic factors as well as sociolinguistic variation have to be taken into account in order to make cognitive analyses more empirically and socially relevant. In conclusion, we sketch a modified cognitive approach informed by Relevance Theory within CDA.","bibo:AuthorList":["Musolff, Andreas"],"dc:date":"2012-05-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19373,"sim:weight":0.41046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185252,"sim:weight":0.368228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763989,"sim:weight":0.367671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1053335,"sim:weight":0.364963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397291,"sim:weight":0.307858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145233,"sim:weight":0.280621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83594,"sim:weight":0.254679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108285,"sim:weight":0.251741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43441,"sim:weight":0.247936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":135202,"sim:weight":0.241829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45119,"sim:weight":0.2356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387303,"sim:weight":0.2343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17956,"sim:weight":0.230782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45258,"sim:weight":0.224324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664547,"sim:weight":0.221259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386225,"sim:weight":0.220211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9016167,"sim:weight":0.214166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43761,"sim:weight":0.211525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155725,"sim:weight":0.21,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41392,"sim:weight":0.209732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
