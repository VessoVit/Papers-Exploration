A dependency of the indentation load on the supporting condition was observed. It was also found that the difference in indentation resistance between the sandwich panel and its corresponding core material depends on the core density.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flores-Johnson, E.

It shows that the deformation mechanism of the progressive collapse of the foam causes the non-uniform deformation in the foam during uniaxial compression, which leads to the decrease of apparent elastic modulus with the increase of strain in the plateau stress regime. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results for different closed-cell polymeric foams with satisfactory agreement. It is also shown that this method is not applicable to the in-plane compression of honeycombs and the numerical modelling based on macroscopic constitutive equation is incapable of predicting the degradation of apparent modulus in progressively-crushable foams.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flores-Johnson, E.

The results suggest, in the main, that switching to broadband made little difference for this group of early broadband adopters who were already heavy internet users. There was no evidence of an online spend or social leisure substitution effect although there was evidence of a reduction in time spent watching television, and an increase in email in use, time spent online and breadth of internet use. In all cases however it was the previous levels of behaviour that were the most significant and switching to broadband was, in general, one of the least strong effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anderson, Ben"],"dc:date":"2008-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18255,"sim:weight":0.751159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998872,"sim:weight":0.375703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998875,"sim:weight":0.373436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.369427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998873,"sim:weight":0.356228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18252,"sim:weight":0.336391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94758,"sim:weight":0.328672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999775,"sim:weight":0.325781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18248,"sim:weight":0.313706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18254,"sim:weight":0.300017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":757762,"sim:weight":0.286513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929823,"sim:weight":0.281593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96338,"sim:weight":0.275883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133461,"sim:weight":0.265269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66570,"sim:weight":0.26428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133464,"sim:weight":0.26376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133715,"sim:weight":0.255739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133451,"sim:weight":0.239849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3004,"sim:weight":0.229659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94762,"sim:weight":0.22855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Through the use of an ethnographic style of enquiry this thesis investigates inpatient admission and discharge processes in the light of various health and social care practices, service commissioning issues, the Department of Health\u0027s initiative of the Care Planning Approach and other local electronic-based initiatives, and how this relates to the notions of “good” and “bad” practices, changing regimes of trust from practitioners to administrators, and from experts to documentary evidence. In particular, a range of narratives associated with mental health care which seek to provide a coordinating frame for different relations are reviewed. This involves exploring the attempts to link different information practices and ontologically distinct objects, and how this process relies on both multiplicity and singularity (e.g. both a sense of stability and heterogenous relations). Finally, this research examines how these mediating objects and processes in acute inpatient care settings seek to contribute to the creation of composite conditions and multiple bodies that fractionally relate to one another, but also the many problems experienced by those involved in the process of mental health care. In conclusion, this thesis explores several issues relating to specific organisational practices of care planning and record keeping, as well as broader questions of how objects are both enacted and enact practices in relation to complex modes of orderings and standardisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hild, Andreas"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.320991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3200,"sim:weight":0.270521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387374,"sim:weight":0.252935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.25166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.250488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18124,"sim:weight":0.24914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.248012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.245669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18052,"sim:weight":0.240808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.236717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.235142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.22833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18127,"sim:weight":0.22708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89407,"sim:weight":0.225649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.224163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387268,"sim:weight":0.216332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.204461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98472,"sim:weight":0.185855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99137,"sim:weight":0.180926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98709,"sim:weight":0.173658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this paper we distinguish between information privacy and physical privacy. As we show, there is good evidence for social norms of limits on the sharing and use of personal information (i.e. information privacy) from traditional interactions in Japanese society, as well as constitutional evidence from the late 19th century (in the Meiji Constitution of 1889). In this context the growing awareness of the Japanese public about problems with networked information processing by public sector and commercial organisations from the 1980s (when a law governing public sector use of personal information was first passed) to recent years (when that law was updated and a first law governing commercial use of personal information was adopted) are not the imposition or adoption of foreign practices nor solely an attempt to lead Japanese society into coherence with the rest of the OECD. Instead they are drawing on the experience of the rest of the developed world in developing legal responses to the breakdown of social norms governing interchange and use of personal information, stressed by the architectural changes wrought by networked information processing capabilities. This claim is supported by consideration of standard models of Japanese social interactions as well as of Supreme Court judgements declaring reasonable expectations of protection of privacy to hold in Japan.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, A.A.","Murata, K","Orito, Y"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.48277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.400658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.399367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.3973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.396239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.395952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162956,"sim:weight":0.387997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.384792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.38137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.36145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.34312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.333771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181880,"sim:weight":0.314074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Multi-Organisational Collaborative Groups (MOCGs) consist of individuals from several organisations which have agreed to work together to solve a problem. The expectation is that more can be achieved working in harmony than separately. Work is done interdependently, rather than independently in diverse directions. Local government, faced with solving complex social problems, deploy MOCGs to enable solutions across organisational, functional, professional and juridical boundaries, by involving statutory, voluntary, community, not-for-profit and private organisations. This is not a silver bullet as it introduces new pressures. Each member organisation has its own goals, operating context and particular approaches, which can be expressed as their norms and business processes. Organisations working together must find ways of eliminating differences or mitigating their impact in order to reduce the risks of collaborative inertia and conflict. A GSS is an electronic collaboration system that facilitates group working and can offer assistance to MOCGs. Since many existing GSSs have been primarily developed for single organisation collaborative groups, even though there are some common issues, there are some difficulties peculiar to MOCGs, and others that they experience to a greater extent: a diversity of primary organisational goals among members; different funding models and other pressures; more significant differences in other information systems both technologically and in their use than single organisations; greater variation in acceptable approaches to solve problems. In this paper, we analyse the requirements of MOCGs led by local government agencies, leading to a conceptual architecture for an e-government GSS that captures the relationships between ‘goal’, ‘context’, ‘norm’, and ‘business process’.

Thus many current social science and human geography views on determinism and social justice are antiquated, ignoring numerous common and well-respected arguments within philosophy that hard determinism can be reconciled with a just society. We support this argument by briefly tracing the parallel development of stances on determinism in the social sciences and the deontological-consequentialist debate in philosophy.

Second, we impose some order on these uses through developing a threefold classification of contingency based on assumptions about possible worlds and determinism. Finally, we discuss why we believe that one of the classes is a special use of the word without relevance to the social sciences, while the two remaining classes are nothing more than a variety of the “no hidden factors” argument in the debate on indeterminism and determinism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ballinger, Clint"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2728,"sim:weight":0.358107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.331086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.329576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108992,"sim:weight":0.325645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.319928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43702,"sim:weight":0.319562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45754,"sim:weight":0.318043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.317466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.317355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930163,"sim:weight":0.316722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.314237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43804,"sim:weight":0.310652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43930,"sim:weight":0.309561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108479,"sim:weight":0.309454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.307369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.305263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43653,"sim:weight":0.305075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.304038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43882,"sim:weight":0.303079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44768,"sim:weight":0.302237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Bourdieu\u0027s theory allows a more refined scheme which incorporates habitus. I elaborate this scheme and derive some propositions regarding the pattern of music consumptions and social structure. A Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause model is used to examine the homology thesis directly; where in the measurement part, a latent class model is used to derive types of consumers (or space of cultural consumption), and simultaneously, in the structural part, a logistic model is used to estimate stratification effects of being in one of the types. Using survey data sponsored by Arts Council England, it is shown that the space of music consumptions is inhabited by two types of music consumers: the popular and the dominant class. Furthermore, this space is shown to be structured by social class thereby lending some support to the homology thesis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tampubolon, Gindo"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.510749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447316,"sim:weight":0.491913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.472763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.449438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16761,"sim:weight":0.430462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.421325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.40373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.396852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.396852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.395242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.393158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46639,"sim:weight":0.392511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46605,"sim:weight":0.380454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.35727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.355644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.345566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.341678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.338995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.336738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.334597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We use Lacan’s (1977, 1998) theory of individual desire as lack, and Laclau and Mouffe’s (1985) logic of antagonism to discuss how the modern individual is constituted as desiring subject. Marketing acts both to produce and fulfil this lack aimed at the satisfaction of customers’ needs and desires.

The term ‘sweatshop’ was at some stage so tightly connected to the brand Nike, that it was entirely conceivable that this huge, now 30 billion Dollars worth, company could be brought to its knees. It wasn’t to be. Despite a worldwide campaign against Nike (and other sweatshop operating companies), the company responded by introducing ‘strict’ codes and conducts for outsourcing factories and workers to follow, which, it was hoped, would address and deal with at least the more serious allegations of terrible sweatshop working conditions and child labour in many of the ‘third world’ factories where Nike products are made. Although at first slow to respond to the massive anti-sweatshop campaign, Nike has learned its lesson fast and it can now proudly say that it takes its ‘responsibility’ very seriously – at least the company says so on its sleek website http://nikeresponsibility.com (note that NikeResponsibility itself seems to have become a brand). But this paper is not proposing to revisit ‘old news’. Rather, the starting point for our investigation is our claim that part of the failure of the anti-sweatshop campaign was its inability to conceptualize and understand the concrete workings of the Nike commodity fetish. And to be sure, this failure is ongoing. Recently, War on Want, a UK-based charity that is playing a very active part in exposing the malpractices of multinational companies in the ‘third world’, has been running a campaign ‘Let’s clean up Fashion’ , to fight against low-price fashion items sold by UK chains such as ASDA, Primark, Tesco, and others. While we very much support this campaign in general, we fear that it doesn’t deal with the workings of the commodity fetish head-on. That is, campaigns like this are well intended – they appeal to consumers’ hearts and minds, to their compassion – but what they do not manage to do is to put forward a rigorous analysis of how the commodity fetish works, and how it could be disrupted. In our view, only a rupture of the workings of the commodity fetish – the act – would achieve real improvements. That is, campaigns like the anti-sweatshop movement, are well intended, but their compassionate pleas are just that: well intended. Žižek (1997) might go further and say that it is campaigns like these that are actually the kernel of today’s ideological cover up. The anti-sweatshop campaign is not fighting the commodity fetish, but enabling it to continue its destructive work precisely through its work of ‘transparency’. We will show in the paper how this double-whammy might work in practice, using the case of Nike. But we are jumping ahead of ourselves. Our paper, then, is a discussion of the workings of commodity fetishism. At work with us is not only Lacan, who will primarily provide input into the workings of enjoyment in today’s consumer culture, but also Marx and Freud who were the early champions of conceptualising fetishism. In Capital, Marx (1976) discusses commodity fetishism as the main ideological structure that keeps capital moving. Freud (1977), in contrast, wasn’t interested in capital but the workings of the human mind, and he saw in fetishism a displacement activity that would enable young boys to get to grips with the apparent castration of their mothers (i.e. the lack of a penis) and the possibilities of their own castration. Although Freud wasn’t a reader of Marx, as far as we know, there have been many attempts to read across Marx’s and Freud’s conceptions of fetishism and somehow integrate their different approaches – we could name Benjamin’s Arcades Project here. Our paper will review such attempts to integrate Marx and Freud, but will then apply these readings to the burning question of: What actually gets people into NikeTown, and what lets us enjoy our visit to the temple of the commodity? In other words, how is it possible that despite the tremendously bad press Nike has had over the past decade, the company is turning out record profit after record profit, as millions flock to the shops to buy its trainers and T-shirts, i.e. they are enjoying the Nike commodity. Here we will make use of Lacan’s (1977, 1998) analysis of enjoyment and jouissance in order to understand the workings of the Nike commodity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Böhm, Steffen","Batta, Aanka"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.542898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.485351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.484268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.482583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.47045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108197,"sim:weight":0.470058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.468388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.452751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.45245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.449416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.447254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.439034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.435887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77218,"sim:weight":0.434231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45754,"sim:weight":0.432884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.43098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.427555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.423152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.418526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352208,"sim:weight":0.409039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper reports exactly this kind of analysis using data from a two wave European panel study (e-Living) and the lagged endogenous regression approach to see if switching to broadband increases the time spent online, the use of online communication services, the breadth of internet activities and the amount of online spend, and whether it decreases the time spent watching TV and the level of social leisure activities. The results suggest, in the main, that switching to broadband made little difference for this group of early broadband adopters who were already heavy internet users. There was no evidence of an online spend or social leisure substitution effect although there was evidence of a reduction in time spent watching television, and an increase in email in use, time spent online and breadth of internet use. In all cases however it was the previous levels of behaviour that were the most significant and switching to broadband was, in general, one of the least strong effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anderson, Ben"],"dc:date":"2008-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18255,"sim:weight":0.84086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.465317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.36045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.359875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96338,"sim:weight":0.35626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.329499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43018,"sim:weight":0.325679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16876,"sim:weight":0.323026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.321285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.317819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.314098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.30569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.305048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133464,"sim:weight":0.303457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94762,"sim:weight":0.291606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133472,"sim:weight":0.285029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133473,"sim:weight":0.285029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93450,"sim:weight":0.285008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51463,"sim:weight":0.284048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.282097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A survey quantifying the adoption of UGC by mainstream news organisations showed a dramatic increase in the opportunities for contributions from readers. In-depth interviews with senior news executives revealed this expansion is taking place despite residual doubts about the editorial and commercial value of material from the public. The study identified a shift towards the use of moderation due to editors\u0027 persistent concerns about reputation, trust, and legal liabilities, indicating that UK newspaper websites are adopting a traditional gate-keeping role towards UGC. The findings suggest a gate-keeping approach may offer a model for the integration of UGC, with professional news organisations providing editorial structures to bring different voices into their news reporting, filtering and aggregating UGC in ways they believe to be useful and valuable to their audience. While this research looked at UGC initiatives in the context of the UK newspaper industry, it has broad relevance as professional journalists tend to share a similar set of norms. The British experience offers valuable lessons for news executives making their first forays into this area and for academics studying the field of participatory journalism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hermida, Alfred","Thurman, Neil"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18265,"sim:weight":0.640347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9625781,"sim:weight":0.515645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.506639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.42424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.416526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43793,"sim:weight":0.406016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929832,"sim:weight":0.390159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.381539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.376288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.366616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44042,"sim:weight":0.363957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929842,"sim:weight":0.360515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9340162,"sim:weight":0.34997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.343071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.340511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9634006,"sim:weight":0.339509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.329372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23028,"sim:weight":0.327341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.314749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.311261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Areas of application include guidance of autonomous vehicles, robotics and process control. This thesis studies Optimal Discrete-Time Preview Control, in which the controlled plant is assumed to be unconstrained, linear and discrete-time, with a preview horizon that extends for a fixed time into the future. Controller optimality is determined using either the H2 or H∞ norms. The central objective of this thesis is to produce a generic set of tools for solving a wide class of H2 and H∞ Preview Control problems. To this end, a very general preview problem is introduced, which captures fixed-lag smoothing, tracking with robust performance specifications, and also preview-based mixed-sensitivity design. In principle, whilst this problem can be solved using standard generalised regulator synthesis results, such an approach is found to require the solution of unacceptably large Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equations (DAREs). A core theme of this thesis involves the efficient solution of the H2 and H∞ versions of such DAREs, and also the order reduction of the resulting controllers. It is found that the dimension of all matrix equations required for controller synthesis, and also the order of the resulting controllers, is no higher than the degree of the plant plus weighting functions. Additional results are presented concerning the norm reduction that is achievable through preview action, and a discussion of the generic properties of preview controllers is provided. Preview Control appears to be well suited for application to autonomous vehicles. However, a class of nonlinearities generically associated with vehicle models prevents its immediate use. Fortunately, this nonlinearity may be accurately represented by a parameterised set of linear systems, from which a simple controller may be derived. This control scheme is successfully demonstrated on a nonlinear bicycle model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hazell, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4890329,"sim:weight":0.529955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4892753,"sim:weight":0.50091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4892751,"sim:weight":0.484687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9028513,"sim:weight":0.469794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43275,"sim:weight":0.451779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53204,"sim:weight":0.449574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932249,"sim:weight":0.441509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4892701,"sim:weight":0.436944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932267,"sim:weight":0.431387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4892707,"sim:weight":0.430864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9039526,"sim:weight":0.428604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4892722,"sim:weight":0.426976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":240751,"sim:weight":0.419397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930369,"sim:weight":0.418851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44023,"sim:weight":0.418848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.415319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":649833,"sim:weight":0.412227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4892738,"sim:weight":0.410803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997998,"sim:weight":0.40894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45523,"sim:weight":0.400834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There is a widespread need for continuing professional development training in Scotland across all sectors, mainly at the more advanced level. • There are a few, small-scale centres of expertise in Scotland, but most quantitative researchers are spread across a range of institutions and disciplines. There are no large-scale networks or centres, and this is viewed as key to building capacity. • There are three general barriers to developing quantitative methods capacity in Scotland. In order of importance, these are ‘antipathy’ (reluctance by students, staff and HEI colleagues to engage with quantitative methods); ‘accessibility’ (availability of/time for training); and ‘enabling’ (lack of funding, collaborative opportunities and data access). • Scotland is a relatively ‘data rich’ country, with a proliferation in recent years of Government funded surveys. However, self-reported usage of Scottish datasets is low and there is a general failure to make the most of available data in Scotland. • Computing and library support services are not well tuned to the needs of quantitative capacity building. Basic levels of support, such as finding resources on the web and offering assistance to access these, are provided; however, students get little extensive user support or instruction in use of datasets and staff do not get support for statistical consultancy or teaching data analysis skills in computer labs. Greater communication and collaboration between support and research staff is needed. • There is support in Scotland for a long-term, strategic approach to building capacity and there are good reasons for developing a specifically Scottish strategy. • A national strategy must include a variety of activities at a range of different levels, such as: boosting numeracy in secondary schools; better engagement with both undergraduate and graduate students; strengthening links between academia and potential employers; more training through continuing professional development; and mentoring for early career researchers. 3 • Boosting capacity will require cultural and structural changes within many institutions and disciplinary areas. Universities and funding bodies must provide strategic investment in order to build a strong infrastructure capable of supporting a critical mass of quantitative trained researchers in Scotland. • The recommendations from this study include creating a Scottish Centre for Social Science Research Methods and establishing a Scottish Summer School.","bibo:AuthorList":["McVie, Susan","Coxon, Anthony P.M.","Hawkins, Philip","Palmer, Jackie","Rice, Robin"],"dc:date":"2008-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47006,"sim:weight":0.565146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.560634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.560617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53956,"sim:weight":0.555157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.554078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17123,"sim:weight":0.544559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.519258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.511561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.502734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1081,"sim:weight":0.486935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23253,"sim:weight":0.480923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51498,"sim:weight":0.478698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.478327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.474232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.456496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43713,"sim:weight":0.449017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46821,"sim:weight":0.431168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43523,"sim:weight":0.427456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.424251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.413282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The results show that, in a period of declining newspaper readership and TV news viewing, editors are keen to embrace new technologies, which are seen as being part of the future of news. At the same time, text is still reported to be the cornerstone for news websites, leading to changes in the grammar and function of news video when used online. The economic rationale for convergence is examined and the paper investigates the partnerships sites have entered into in order to be able to serve their audience with video content. In-house video is complimenting syndicated content, and the authors examine the resulting developments in newsroom training and recruitment practices. The paper provides journalism and interactive media scholars with case studies on the changes taking place in newsrooms as a result of the shift towards multimedia, multiplatform news consumption.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thurman, Neil J","Lupton, Ben"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.460491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929842,"sim:weight":0.449372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.443049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18204,"sim:weight":0.431143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84996,"sim:weight":0.423139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929832,"sim:weight":0.421322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.419734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44354,"sim:weight":0.415153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.408381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.405256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.405181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43793,"sim:weight":0.402682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.397474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227167,"sim:weight":0.365652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.360037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.359952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23028,"sim:weight":0.359212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.355604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.349659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445178,"sim:weight":0.342261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This claim appears to be supported by the police authorities [Bal06a], although in addition to a broad claim regarding protection of privacy, their view is that private CCTV should be forced to be of sufficient quality and sufficiently accessible, to be of use to the police. Given the Office of the Surveillance Commissioners [OSC] existing role in oversight of police surveillance operations, it is suggested that the OSC be made responsible for licensing and regulating CCTV systems and operators. Protection of raw video data as a potential source of Personal Data when processed is necessary (and currently outside the scope of the Office of the Information Commissioner [OIC]). Where raw video data is sufficiently processed to produce Personal Data or where it is linked with other data sufficient to identify individuals, the data would then pass to the aegis of the OIC.

As a result, considerable effort is invested in the development of software tools and technologies for numerical simulations and for the creation and publication of models. The diversity of related tools leads to the duplication of effort and hinders model reuse. Development practices and technologies that support interoperability between software systems therefore play an important role in making the modeling process more efficient and in ensuring that published models can be reliably and easily reused. Various forms of interoperability are possible including the development of portable model description standards, the adoption of common simulation languages or the use of standardized middleware. Each of these approaches finds applications within the broad range of current modeling activity. However more effort is required in many areas to enable new scientific questions to be addressed. Here we present the conclusions of the \"NeuroÃ�Â­IT Interoperability of Simulators\" workshop, held at the 11th computational neuroscience meeting in Edinburgh (July 19/Ã�Â­20 2006; www.cnsorg.org).

This claim appears to be supported by the police authorities [Bal06a], although in addition to a broad claim regarding protection of privacy, their view is that private CCTV should be forced to be of sufficient quality and sufficiently accessible, to be of use to the police. Given the Office of the Surveillance CommissionersÃ¢Â�Â� [OSC] existing role in oversight of police surveillance operations, it is suggested that the OSC be made responsible for licensing and regulating CCTV systems and operators. Protection of raw video data as a potential source of Personal Data when processed is necessary (and currently outside the scope of the Office of the Information Commissioner [OIC]). Where raw video data is sufficiently processed to produce Personal Data or where it is linked with other data sufficient to identify individuals, the data would then pass to the aegis of the OIC. Specific proposals for securing data and infrastructure are suggested, in addition to some general Surveillance Protection Principles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, A.A.","Bynum, T.W.","Rogerson, S.","Murata, K."],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98865,"sim:weight":0.493422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.437792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.42845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.423967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.423882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96260,"sim:weight":0.414769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96261,"sim:weight":0.410817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23028,"sim:weight":0.407029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.403928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43638,"sim:weight":0.392433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93536,"sim:weight":0.389665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.388016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48361,"sim:weight":0.361027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.356566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43523,"sim:weight":0.355902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48300,"sim:weight":0.353161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.352416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55190,"sim:weight":0.351109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.347185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43428,"sim:weight":0.342749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It allows the specification of the Universal Perspex Machine which unifies geometry with the Turing Machine. Here we axiomatise the algebraic structure of transreal arithmetic so that it provides a total arithmetic on any appropriate set of numbers. This opens up the possibility of specifying a version of floating-point arithmetic that does not have any arithmetical exceptions and in which every number is a first-class citizen. We find that literal numbers in the axioms are distinct. In other words, the axiomatisation does not require special axioms to force non-triviality. It follows that transreal arithmetic must be defined on a set of numbers that contains {-infinity, -1, 0, 1, infinity, nullity} as a proper subset. We note that the axioms have been shown to be consistent by machine proof.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anderson, J.A.D.W.","Voelker, N.","Adams, A.A.","Latecki, L.J.","Mount, D.M.","Wu, A.Y."],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":767007,"sim:weight":0.596269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85430,"sim:weight":0.354793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2744734,"sim:weight":0.332795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77020,"sim:weight":0.331844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86312,"sim:weight":0.325076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890296,"sim:weight":0.319086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45738,"sim:weight":0.3098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351913,"sim:weight":0.295933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998220,"sim:weight":0.282704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.280285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.260848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999162,"sim:weight":0.251444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387124,"sim:weight":0.248552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81277,"sim:weight":0.230612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.228804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146069,"sim:weight":0.227671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98537,"sim:weight":0.224784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43859,"sim:weight":0.217349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26347,"sim:weight":0.213826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16876,"sim:weight":0.195809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this paper we present a spectrum of approaches to solving the various problems inherent in this task, arguing that a variety of approaches is both necessary and useful. The main ideas presented are about the differences between digitised mathematics, digitally represented mathematics and formalised mathematics. Each has its part to play in managing mathematical information in a connected world. Digitised material is that which is embodied in a computer file, accessible and displayable locally or globally. Represented material is digital material in which there is some structure (usually syntactic in nature) which maps to the mathematics contained in the digitised information. Formalised material is that in which both the syntax and semantics of the represented material, is automatically accessible. Given the range of mathematical information to which access is desired, and the limited resources available for managing that information, we must ensure that these resources are applied to digitise, form representations of or formalise, existing and new mathematical information in such a way as to extract the most benefit from the least expenditure of resources.

This involves splitting the rational function integrand using partial fractions. The resulting integrands all fall within a limited class which may be covered in a DITLU by a very small number of table entries.

We extend upon FatemanÃ¢Â�Â�s web-based table by including parametric limits of integration and queries with side conditions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, A.A.","Gottliebsen, H.","Linton, S.A.","Martin, U.","Dooley, S."],"dc:date":"1999","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18278,"sim:weight":0.619783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.437602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.434505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2744734,"sim:weight":0.42584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":240751,"sim:weight":0.422408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2111921,"sim:weight":0.419268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26347,"sim:weight":0.413734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16876,"sim:weight":0.401084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106942,"sim:weight":0.398912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1339,"sim:weight":0.394078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86557,"sim:weight":0.389338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.386199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.383111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.380179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932650,"sim:weight":0.373253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98829,"sim:weight":0.370604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18280,"sim:weight":0.369991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351913,"sim:weight":0.359267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43480,"sim:weight":0.345602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.343755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thus many current social science and human geography views on determinism and social justice are antiquated, ignoring numerous common and well-respected arguments within philosophy that hard determinism can be reconciled with a just society. We support this argument by briefly tracing the parallel development of stances on determinism in the social sciences and the deontological-consequentialist debate in philosophy. The article concludes with a brief consideration of deterministic consequentialist ethics, social justice, and the problems of egoism and altruism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ballinger, Clint"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.333432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48320,"sim:weight":0.327487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44768,"sim:weight":0.317177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.295431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.289262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":617735,"sim:weight":0.286472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.28406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.280814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.278089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.268161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.267115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.261754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17861,"sim:weight":0.253047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.251251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.246958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.246054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46587,"sim:weight":0.224158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.220747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47545,"sim:weight":0.175425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At a recent workshop in Kuala Lumpur it was recommended that \u0027quid\u0027 be defined as \u0027a substance, or mixture of substances, placed in the mouth or chewed and remaining in contact with the mucosa, usually containing one or both of the two basic ingredients, tobacco and/or areca nut, in raw or any manufactured or processed form.\u0027 Clear delineations on contents of the quid (areca nut quid, tobacco quid, and tobacco and areca nut quid) are recommended as absolute criteria with finer subdivisions to be added if necessary. The betel quid refers to any quid wrapped in betel leaf and is therefore a specific variety of quid. The workshop proposed that quid-related lesions should be categorized conceptually into two categories: first, those that are diffusely outlined and second, those localized at the site where a quid is regularly placed. Additional or expanded criteria and guidelines were proposed to define, describe or identify lesions such as chewer\u0027s mucosa, areca nut chewer\u0027s lesion, oral submucous fibrosis and other quid-related lesions. A new clinical entity, betel-quid lichenold lesion, was also proposed to describe an oral lichen planuslike lesion associated with the betel quid habit.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zain, R.

Strong assimilationist policies over the past fifty years have meant indians have been discriminated against in many areas of social life. Rural schools have been a principal tool in assimilation. Over the past decade political and education reform have shifted policy  away from an assimilationist model to a multicultural one. Of great significance is the requirement for use of indigenous language in school and, as consequence, large numbers of teachers who themselves come from indian communities.  Despite  these policies, schoolteachers are still a major source of assimilationist cultural ideology and are principal agents in reproducing hegemonic racism in indian communities. It cannot be assumed that indian teachers will be positive models for indian children in a racist society; indeed the ambiguous racial and cultural position of the indian teacher may mean quite the opposite. This paper, based on anthropological fieldwork, examines the role of teachers and schooling in an Aymara-speaking highland village.","bibo:AuthorList":["Canessa, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2004-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48357,"sim:weight":0.3269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383595,"sim:weight":0.271625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.253087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98918,"sim:weight":0.233822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50439,"sim:weight":0.223482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.216401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44868,"sim:weight":0.212987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.208599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387418,"sim:weight":0.208387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48398,"sim:weight":0.205949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":691605,"sim:weight":0.198031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381950,"sim:weight":0.194557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385299,"sim:weight":0.162465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48324,"sim:weight":0.160933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381999,"sim:weight":0.158411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47129,"sim:weight":0.146511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48269,"sim:weight":0.144521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98927,"sim:weight":0.144304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383641,"sim:weight":0.139858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44572,"sim:weight":0.139003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Online questionnaires were emailed to Malaysian manufacturing SMEs and 74 usable questionnaires were received, representing a 20.8 percent return rate. In order to avoid biases which may result from pre-suggested answers, a series of open-ended questions were retrieved from the experts. This study was focused on analyzing an open-ended question, whereby four main themes were extracted from the experts’ recommendations regarding the effectiveness of virtual teams for the growth and performance of SMEs. The findings of this study would be useful to product design managers of SMEs in order to realize the key advantages and significance of virtual R\u0026D teams during the new product development (NPD) process.

In both countries, SMEs play an important role in their economies, employments, and capacity building. Virtual R\u0026D team can be one of the means to increase SMEs efficiency and competitiveness in their local as well as global markets. In this context, surveys have been conducted to evaluate the effects of virtuality to the growth of SMEs. The study addresses some differences between two countries in engaging virtual research and development (R\u0026D) teams in their SMEs. It is observed that there is a significant difference between the SMEs turnover that employed virtual team and that did not employ the virtual team. The way for further studies and recommend improvements are proposed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ale Ebrahim, Nader","Ahmed, Shamsuddin","Taha, Zahari"],"dc:date":"2010-09-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46854,"sim:weight":0.488114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1138145,"sim:weight":0.437183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91147,"sim:weight":0.416719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":115049,"sim:weight":0.270062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45128,"sim:weight":0.237629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":284569,"sim:weight":0.204404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25977,"sim:weight":0.194075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.148467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99068,"sim:weight":0.13353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383594,"sim:weight":0.125414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90187,"sim:weight":0.116148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386651,"sim:weight":0.106913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45037,"sim:weight":0.103943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383675,"sim:weight":0.0956119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.0662494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

During the past decade, new product development (NPD) has increasingly been recognized as a critical factor in ensuring the continued survival of SMEs. On the other hand, the rapid rate of market and technological changes has accelerated in the past decade, so this turbulent environment requires new methods and techniques to bring successful new products to the marketplace. Virtual team can be a solution to answer the requested demand. However, literature have shown no significant differences between traditional NPD and virtual NPD in general, whereas NPD in SME\u0027s virtual team has not been systematically investigated in developing countries. This paper aims to bridge this gap by first reviewing the NPD and its relationship with virtuality and then identifies the critical factors of NPD in virtual teams. The statistical method was utilized to perform the required analysis of data from the survey. The results were achieved through factor analysis at the perspective of NPD in some Malaysian and Iranian manufacturing firms (N \u003d 191). The 20 new product development factors were grouped into five higher level constructs. It gives valuable insight and guidelines, which hopefully will help managers of firms in developing countries to consider the main factors in NPD.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ale Ebrahim, Nader","Ahmed, Shamsuddin","Taha, Zahari"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8929456,"sim:weight":0.729785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383413,"sim:weight":0.652254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99151,"sim:weight":0.299839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381928,"sim:weight":0.2544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1138145,"sim:weight":0.210949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.209592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387323,"sim:weight":0.209145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9851,"sim:weight":0.171762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45128,"sim:weight":0.139093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99068,"sim:weight":0.125412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000432,"sim:weight":0.121826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.0742759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A relation found in even-N and even-Z stable nuclei between the number of neutrons (N) and protons (Z) makes possible the introduction of several stability curves within the valley of stability. These stability curves applied to the stable even-even nuclei account for a good majority of the values of Z and N, a much larger number of stable nuclei than previously possible. The application of a stability curve to the nuclear charge radius, as a function of the nuclear mass number, captures closely the observed values. These last two applications require only 2 single valued parameters. This interpretation of nuclear stability suggests various significant modifications to current and traditional phenomenological standards of the liquid drop binding energy models. A quantum theory of the model integrates it to the proposed modifications of the liquid drop models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gutierrez, Walton R"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2832562,"sim:weight":0.752166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98799,"sim:weight":0.174061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99177,"sim:weight":0.147085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387413,"sim:weight":0.139377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44193,"sim:weight":0.136281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99445,"sim:weight":0.132032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269907,"sim:weight":0.130221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23279,"sim:weight":0.12404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98490,"sim:weight":0.116274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99248,"sim:weight":0.114282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The mean age at the presentation was 62 years. The most frequent sites affected were gum, sulci, cheek and tongue. Indulgence in risk habits was reported in about 70% of patients. Four cases developed multifocal carcinoma from multifocal leukoplakia. Conclusions: In retrospect, none of the cases fulfilled the original PVL criteria, although three cases were suggestive of PVL. Nevertheless, these findings do not necessarily preclude the existence of PVL as a clinicopathological entity in Malaysian population.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ghazali, N.","Bakri, M. M.","Zain, R.

Interestingly, these enzymes also metabolize ITCs therefore; the protective effects of ITCs would depend on the activity of GSTs. This study aimed to determine association between dietary ITCs, GSTs polymorphisms and risk habits (cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking and betel-quid chewing) with oral cancer.Method: Included in this study were 115 OSCC patients and 116 healthy subjects. Information on ITC intake from cruciferous vegetables was collected via a semi-quantitative FFQ. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained for genotyping of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 using PCR multiplex and PCR-RFLP. Chi-square and logistic regression were performed to determine the association of ITC and GSTs polymorphism and risk of oral cancer.Results: When dietary ITC was categorized into high (greater than/equal to median) and low (less than median) intake, ITC consumption was higher among cases (51.3%) than controls. However, it was not statistically significant (p \u003d 0.645). Discussion: Odd ratios analysis showed no significant association between ITC intake, GSTM1, GSTT1 or GSTP1 genotypes with oral cancer risk. However, GSTP1 wild-type was associated with later disease onset in women above 55 years of age (p \u003d 0.017). Among men above 45 years of age, there was a significant 17-year difference in the age of OSCC onset between those with GSTP1 wild-type ? low ITC intake and GSTP1 polymorphism ? high ITC intake (p \u003c 0.001). Similarly further analysis stratified by risk habits (drinking and chewing), showed that GSTP1 polymorphism ? high ITC intake was associated with earlier disease onset (p \u003c 0.001). This study suggests that combinatory effects between dietary ITCs, GSTP1 polymorphism and risk habits may be associated with risk of oral cancer and modulate the age of disease onset.","bibo:AuthorList":["Karen-Ng, L.

However, our ability to deliver effective and targeted therapy remains limited by our lack of understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of oral carcinogenesis. One method to understand the nature of genes and gene products whose aberrant expression promote malignant transformation is by using microarrays. However, such studies have been limited by the availability of specimens with intact RNA and adequate clinical data to enable the identi?cation and validation biomarkers either as predictive or therapeutic tools. Objective: We have determined the global gene expression pro?les of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) of the buccal mucosa using formalin ?xed paraf?n-embedded specimens. Materials and Methods: Gene expression analyses using the DASL Assay were performed on 34 paraf?n embedded tissues, of which 22 samples were OSCC of the buccal mucosa and 12 samples were normal surface epithelium of reactive lesions such as the ?broepithelial polyp from matched site. We used the Illumina Beadstudio Software to compare the expression pro?les of normal and OSCC samples. We selected genes which were differentially expressed by at least two-fold (with the detection p-value \u003c0.01) for further analysis. Results: A total of 47 genes were differentially expressed by at least two-fold between normal and OSCC. Deregulated genes included genes which were involved in cell signaling, adhesion and invasion, such as ITGB4, MMP1, MMP10, MMP7, CXCL9, and ALOX12. We have validated the over-expression of MMP1, ITGB4 and MMP10, and down-regulation of ALOX12 by quantitative real-time PCR. Conclusion: We have successfully conducted global gene expression studies using paraf?n-embedded buccal mucosa specimens. This approach has enabled the identi?cation of genes whose expression can help explain the aggressive nature of oral cancers arising from the buccal mucosa.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saleh, A.","Zain, R.

Efforts in our laboratory have focused on the molecular profiling of oral cancer to understand the mechanisms underlying the disease. In a previous microarray study, we found Guanine nucleotide binding protein alpha-12 (GNA12) to be up-regulated in oral cancer. Materials and methods: In this study, we validated the expression of GNA12 at the mRNA level in 47 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and 18 non-malignant oral mucosa tissues, by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Further, GNA12 protein expression was accessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 44 tumors and 23 non-malignant oral mucosa tissues. Using OSCC cell lines, we examined the effects of GNA12 signaling by in vitro functional assays. Results: We demonstrated that GNA12 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated in OSCC in comparison to the non-malignant oral mucosa tissues. Consistently, high levels of GNA12 protein expression were detected in 75% of OSCC tissues, while the non-malignant tissues showed negative or weak expression. We demonstrated that expression of activated GNA12 (GQ231L) promoted oral cancer cell migration in a monolayer wound healing assay and cell invasion through the matrigel barrier, but cell proliferation was not changed. Correspondingly, exogenous expression of the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) blocked G12 family signaling through RhoA, which resulted in the inhibition of cancer cell migration and invasion. Discussion: In summary, we demonstrated for the first time in OSCC that GNA12 is over-expressed in a large percentage of these patients and notably, the over-expression drives migration and invasion of oral cancer cells. Taken together, this information indicates that targeting GNA12 could benefit oral cancer patients by preventing the spread of the disease.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kipli, N.P.","Kumar, S.K.S.","Zain, R.

Updated epidemiological data on the increased BQ use among Asian populations using comparable data collection methods have not been widely available. To investigate the prevalence, patterns of practice and associated types of oral preneoplastic disorders, an intercountry Asian Betel-quid Consortium study (the ABC study) was conducted for Taiwan, Mainland China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal and Sri Lanka. A random sample of 8,922 subjects was recruited, and the data were analyzed using survey-data modules adjusted for the complex survey design. Chewing rates among men (10.7-43.6) were significantly higher than women (1.8-34.9) in Taiwan, Mainland China, Nepal and Sri Lanka, while women\u0027s rates (29.5-46.8) were higher than that for men (9.8-12.0) in Malaysia and Indonesia. An emerging, higher proportion of new-users were identified for Hunan in Mainland China (11.1-24.7), where Hunan chewers have the unique practice of using the dried husk of areca fruit rather than the solid nut universally used by others. Men in the Eastern and South Asian study communities were deemed likely to combine chewing with smoking and drinking (5.6-13.6). Indonesian women who chewed BQ exhibited the highest prevalence of oral lichen planus, oral submucous fibrosis and oral leukoplakia (9.1-17.3). Lower schooling, alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking were identified as being associated with BQ chewing. In conclusion, the ABC study reveals the significant cultural and demographic differences contributing to practice patterns of BQ usage and the great health risks that such practices pose in the Asian region.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, C.

A wide variety of therapeutic approaches have failed to result in the predictable arrest of resorption, with a good long-term prognosis for tooth survival. Bisphosphonates are used in the medical management of a range of bone disorders and topically applied bisphosphonate has been reported to inhibit root resorption in dogs. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a bisphosphonate (etidronate disodium) as an intracanal medicament in the root canals of avulsed monkey teeth, placed before replantation after 1 h of extraoral dry storage. Incisors of six Macaca fascicularis monkeys were extracted and stored dry for 1 h. Teeth were then replanted after canal contamination with dental plaque (negative control) or after root canal debridement and placement of etidronate sealed in the canal space. A positive control of calcium hydroxide placed 8-9 days after replantation was also included. All monkeys were sacrificed 8 weeks later and block sections were prepared for histomorphometric assessment of root resorption and periodontal ligament status. Untreated teeth showed the greatest extent of root resorption (46 of the root surface), which was predominantly inflammatory in nature. Calcium hydroxide treated teeth showed the lowest overall level of resorption (\u003c30 of the root surface), while the bisphosphonate-treated group was intermediate (39). Ankylosis, defined as the extent of the root surface demonstrating direct bony union to both intact and resorbed root surface, was the lowest in the untreated control group (15 of the root surface), intermediate in the calcium hydroxide group (27) and the highest in the bisphosphonate group (41). Bony attachment to the tooth root was divided approximately equally between attachment to intact cementum and to previously resorbed dentin. Overall, bisphosphonate resulted in a worse outcome than calcium hydroxide in terms of both root resorption and ankylosis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thong, Y. L.","Messe r, H. H.","Zain, R. B.","Saw, L.

At 14 days, the number of taste buds increased from this low level, and by 30 days the number approached the control values. Initial taste bud loss could be attributed to a direct irradiation damage leading to taste bud cell desquamation combined with a concomitant mitotic inhibition of the stratum germinativum.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zain, R.

Between 1954 and 1960, the first personal contacts with Everest expedition leader John Hunt then opened up a window to the world (not only) for Soviet mountaineers, while at the same time the blossoming Sino-Soviet friendship of the mid1950s enabled Soviet mountaineers to prepare for their own, however unsuccessful, Sino-Soviet Everest Expedition. Everest acted as a catalyst for increasing contacts between East and West, capitalist and communist climbers, which provided new chances for comparison and self-reflection and thus contributed to the emergence of new discourses of identity and community within Soviet mountaineering.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maurer, Eva"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9849,"sim:weight":0.627997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77194,"sim:weight":0.491448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631734,"sim:weight":0.422505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386658,"sim:weight":0.407212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45332,"sim:weight":0.385662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99435,"sim:weight":0.324249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.283939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931411,"sim:weight":0.27639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.271379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.265934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85220,"sim:weight":0.262788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76553,"sim:weight":0.253577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382032,"sim:weight":0.247126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108694,"sim:weight":0.246073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.243976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.240909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.239561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.239561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2789290,"sim:weight":0.238206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109054,"sim:weight":0.236043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The purpose of this study is to further investigate the serum levels of certain micronutrients in a selected group of Indians from estate population in Malaysia. Out of 561 subjects screened for oral cancer and/or precancer (OPC), blood samples were obtained from more than 300 subjects. Serum analysis for Ret, AT, Zeaxanthin/Lutein (Z/L), Cryptoxanthin (Cry), Lycophene (Lye), AC, BC have currently been completed for 255 subjects. The mean age of these 255 subjects was 46.62±11.57 years. Out of 255 subjects 80 (31.4%) had no lesions, 62 (24.3%) had chewer’s mucosa and 95 (37.3%) had OPC and 18 (7.1%) had other lesions. Except for BC and Z/L, serum levels of micronutrients Ret, AT, Cry, Lye and AC were lower in subjects with OPC when compared to those without lesion. However, there was no significant difference observed between these groups. Similarly, when subjects with leukoplakia (67 cases) were compared with those without lesions, it was found that whilst all values were lower in the former, there was no significant difference observed. A comparison of prevalence of quid chewing and OPC showed a statistically significant association (p\u003c0.001). Furthermore, 2 variables namely, quid chewing (odds ration\u003d 34.0) and AC (odds ratio\u003d 0.76) were detected as risk factors in a logistic regressive analysis. The present preliminary result suggests that the prevalence of OPC and in particular leukoplakia in significantly associated with quid chewing and/or lower serum level of AC in these populations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zain, R.

This study aims to assess the association between sociodemographic and clinicopathological parameters with survival of OSCC patients. Method: Data were collected from 253 histologically diagnosed OSCC patients attending selected clinics nationwide. Survival was analyzed for relation with habits, site, disease stage and nodal involvement. Results: Mean age was 58.9 ± 12.6 years with 8.3% aged less than 40. Majority is females (61.1%) and of Indian ethnic (48.0%). Most common habit was quid chewing (55.8%), followed by smoking (29.7%) and most came at stage IV (44.3%). Tongue was the most common site (38.9%), followed by buccal mucosa (35.0%). Factors associated with survival are smoking (p \u003d 0.016), stage at presentation (p \u003c 0.001) and nodal involvement (p \u003c 0.001). Discussion: Majority of OSCC cases occurred among Indians where the patients were quid chewers and presents with advanced cancer. Survival of patients decreased steadily over the years. At 1 year after diagnosis, 67.2% was still alive but only 13.4% survived 5 years. Among the habits studied, only smoking was found to be associated with survival where among those smoking, only 38.7% is alive compared to 61.3% deceased. No association was found between site and survival. A highly significant association was seen for both cancer stage and nodal involvement with survival. More survivors were found among those who come at early stage (76.3%) compared to late stage (32.7%). Similarly, more than two thirds (69.1%) of those who present with negative nodal involvement were found to be alive. In conclusion, smoking, disease stage and nodal status are predictors of survival for OSCC patients in Malaysia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ghani, W. M. N.","Zain, R. B.","Jalil, N.","Razak, I.

Methods: Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surface of thirty extracted sound premolars and were restored with a nanohybrid composite (Grandio, VOCO, Germany). Specimens were subsequently coated with nail varnish exposing 2mm of enamel around the restoration margin. The specimens were divided into three equal groups of 10 and were then immersed in acid gel and qat extracts (10 and 20) for 4 weeks. All specimens were removed and washed using deionized water and later examined by direct vision and stereomicroscope prior to sectioning. Specimens were then immersed in distilled water for 24 hours, following which the sections were examined under polarized light microscope and demineralized area was measured as outer and wall lesion in the coronal and cervical part of restoration using image analyzer software (Image-Pro Version 4.5). Data were subjected to One-way MANOVA. Results: All specimens immersed in acid gel and qat extracts (10 and 20) exhibit demineralization at the restoration interface. The One-way MANOVA also indicated significant differences between the three groups on the different restoration interface (P\u003c.05) and Tukey multiple comparison test was also performed as illustrated in the table below.

Analysis of a unique data set (US-General Social Survey 1993) which provides \u0027likes\u0027 as well as \u0027dislikes\u0027 information has shown that certain omnivores draw symbolic boundaries to exclude low-status cultures, i.e. those preferred by low-status people. I re-analysed the data using the MIMIC model which simultaneously derives patterns of cultural tastes and estimates the effects of multiple stratification factors. This uncovers results which contradict previous findings. The results show that high-status people dislike many high-status as well as low-status cultures. The earlier contradicted findings arise from sample selection bias and neglect of patterns in cultural tastes, and simultaneously, multiple stratification axes underlying cultural tastes. Americans\u0027 cultural tastes are clearly patterned as well as strongly and orthogonally structured by multiple axes of stratification in addition to education which has often been a dominant focus. A disengagement of omnivorousness from inclusiveness is also proposed to deal with the manifest exclusiveness displayed by the cultural omnivores.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tampubolon, Gindo"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.154913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.154507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.150199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.13736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.134919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98466,"sim:weight":0.132417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.12699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108452,"sim:weight":0.109043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58888,"sim:weight":0.102876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58210,"sim:weight":0.0981721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

More and more people are\r\nidentifying themselves as indigenous whereas in the recent past they would more likely have seen themselves simply as campesinos, peasants, or urban mestizos. International agencies such as the ILO, UN and World Bank stress the importance of self-identification for indigenous people; and in the last (2001) census just over 20% of the Bolivian population identified themselves as indigenous despite no\r\nrecorded ethnolinguistic marker that would suggest they would be; others who do not self-identify as indigenous were recorded in the census as being indigenous. This paper explores some of the issues behind self-identification and in particular examines the case of an Aymara-speaking community where people were recorded as indigenous and “ethnolinguistic markers” abound, yet do not self-identify as such. Despite its apparent homogeneity in terms of a strong sense of shared culture and kinship relations, the people of Pocobaya vary considerably in how they identify themselves as ethnic/racial subjects. Whereas outside groups, agencies, and indigenous leaders are creating and recognizing an indigenous identity based on a particular view of history and conquest, many other people have a much more complex sense of who they are.","bibo:AuthorList":["canessa, andrew"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2832412,"sim:weight":0.568076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108656,"sim:weight":0.469614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48324,"sim:weight":0.463648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":246360,"sim:weight":0.462329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45754,"sim:weight":0.435755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.435577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.410657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98879,"sim:weight":0.404302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447316,"sim:weight":0.389019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47546,"sim:weight":0.386702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9052213,"sim:weight":0.386095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.38329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76553,"sim:weight":0.382221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.382077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.381644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.381405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89116,"sim:weight":0.36921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.36722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.361071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.349468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The discourses of politicians who invoke five centuries of oppression are frequently heard and easily accessible but much less so are the views of indigenous people far from the arena of metropolitan politics.

One may be able to foresee from the pace of cybernetic innovation and technology growth of today how human race will brace ahead of time in the next millennium. Along with that, there will also tend to be the real fierce competition among hominid species for resources which would virtually become too scarce or extinct, and hence, too expensive. The world would perhaps have had exhausted most of her potential resources by the end of this century, if not or so earlier. However, the only resource that would be available widely and in common is, perhaps, information, knowledge and \"time\"; although, the cost of acquiring such information and processing of such may become highly competitive, as well, time-dependent. And in congruence, what would be the real nature of decision-making process, and how human beings would take decisions in their everyday life, and how important strategic choices may render future corporate world to streamline their competitive efforts would be an interesting subject for inquisitive inquiry. The question then one may ask, will there still be poverty and inequity, and of what nature would it be, if it is deemed to be there, by considering the fact that the world population would double by 2060. Hence, I try to draw an imaginative fore-view of what might be the true nature of human existence in the beginning of the next millennia and at the turn of this century. Thus, I try to provide some virtual expectations of reality from fiction that would, in some part, draw an imaginary map of our world through the 22nd century, though however vague that may be and most of us would not be there physically to appreciate such dramatic changes by then.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chatterjee, Sidharta"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1131997,"sim:weight":0.566427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1017334,"sim:weight":0.321317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645518,"sim:weight":0.262631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501391,"sim:weight":0.260831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1123236,"sim:weight":0.247189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":959064,"sim:weight":0.246883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827155,"sim:weight":0.235475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1106581,"sim:weight":0.230887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":959070,"sim:weight":0.226499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1024651,"sim:weight":0.220472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040752,"sim:weight":0.188537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":959047,"sim:weight":0.177321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1122892,"sim:weight":0.158181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":487612,"sim:weight":0.155653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1090426,"sim:weight":0.148986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":999781,"sim:weight":0.140548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1090428,"sim:weight":0.129205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":986227,"sim:weight":0.117524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1123238,"sim:weight":0.11738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":868967,"sim:weight":0.104845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Nevertheless, every company cannot cope up progressively or immediately with the market requirements due to knowledge dynamics being experienced in the competitive milieu. Increased competition and reduced product life cycles put force upon companies to develop new products faster. In response to these pressing needs, there should be some new approach compatible in flexible circumstances. This paper presents a solution based on the popular Stage-Gate system, which is closely linked with virtual team approach. Virtual teams can provide a platform to advance the knowledge-base in a company and thus to reduce time-to-market. This article introduces conceptual product development architecture under a virtual team umbrella.

Some texts, such as Dark Lord of Derkholm with its cross-generational heroes, violate the genre\u0027s expected relationship between the age of the implied reader and that the protagonists. In other other texts, including Hexwood, the protagonist\u0027s true age is hidden from everyone, including the protagonist himself. These two texts aren\u0027t unusual in a body of work which includes timeshifting flashbacks, adults regressed to toddlers, and a century-old adolescent. This paper explores the function of age and expectation in Jones\u0027 works, primarily focused on this pair of texts. It examines how a text with an adult or age-shifting protagonist implies a child reader in a genre with fairly solid conventions for protagonist age. It examines the texts\u0027 building of sympathy for mixed-generational groups, instead of presenting adults as antagonists, mentors, or parental figures. It explores how the reader\u0027s interpretation of a protagonist does or doesn\u0027t change when that character belatedly shifts from young adolescent young adult. Finally, this paper examines the unusual nature of all of these treatments of age, and examines them in the context of fixed genre expectations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kaplan, Deborah"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8827054,"sim:weight":0.0765756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Such ADEs have a major impact the health of users of medicinal products. Japan is a major consumer country of drugs, however, few published studies have examined polypharmacy in Japan.\r\nObjectives: To describe the drug use patterns and to identify risk factors for polypharmacy in elderly persons in Hiroshima, Japan.\r\nMethods: This is a cross-sectional study, using secondary data of drug utilization in an elderly cohort from Hiroshima, Japan during October through December 2009. Polypharmacy was defined as the concomitant use of five or more drugs (prescription or over-the-counter). Study participants agreed to have all their medications reviewed by the attending pharmacists at participating sites and to provide information, including demographic (age, sex) and underlying diseases. The patterns of drug use were evaluated using descriptive statistics. Stepwise logistic regression models were utilised to identify factors (e.g., age, comorbidities, therapeutic drug class), independently associated with polypharmacy use.\r\nResults: A total of 452 persons (median age\u003d76 years, 66% female) were included in this study. Of these paesons, 70% met the definition for polypharmacy (median number of drugs\u003d7, range\u003d5 to 24). The following valriables were significantly associated with polypharmacy use: female sex, comorbidity score (Charlson comorbidity index), and use of at least one medication in certaion therapeutic categories (e.g., antihypertensives, vasodilators, peptic ulcer agents and others). Age and receiving prescriptions from multiple prescribers were not independent predictors of polypharmacy use.\r\nConclusions: Age was not an independent predictor of polypharmacy among elderly people. Prevention strategies for ADEs resulting from polypharmacy should target sicker patients (i.e., comorbidities) and patients receiving care from multiple providers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kaori, Nomura"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1125670,"sim:weight":0.708575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":824532,"sim:weight":0.351311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1090882,"sim:weight":0.289316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109932,"sim:weight":0.253883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1089871,"sim:weight":0.233669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5687671,"sim:weight":0.179646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77264,"sim:weight":0.135296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9633946,"sim:weight":0.115266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177273,"sim:weight":0.0605242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

According to studies worldwide, imbalanced diet and nutrient deficiency have been attributed to promote oral malignancies. However, the function of specific nutrients in preventing oral cancer remains largely undefined. This study aims to investigate the association between intake of retinol and vitamin C with the risk of oral cancer. Materials and methods: Dietary intake data was collected from 8 participating hospitals throughout Malaysia using a validated foodfrequency questionnaire (FFQ). Intake of retinol and vitamin C were computed using the Nutriemart software. This case-control study included 150 cases and 150 controls matched for age, gender and ethnicity.The association between micronutrients, risk habits and oral cancer was analysed using Pearson Chi-Square test and multiple logistic regression. Results: Significantly more controls were found to consume retinol (27.3%) and vitamin C (83.3%) above the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) as compared to cases (10.7% and 72.0%, respectively). Among risk habits, only cigarette smoking was found to have an inverse association with vitamin C (p \u003d 0.021) where as no risk habits were found to be associated with retinol intake. After adjusting for confounding factors, only retinol intake was found to be inversely related to the risk of oral cancer (aOR 0.272, 95%CI 0.135– 0.548). Discussion: This study suggests that vitamin C appears to reduce risk of oral cancer and this relationship is weakened after adjusting for risk habits. Meanwhile, retinol intake proves to provide protection against oral cancer up to 72.8% independent of risk habits practiced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vimmitra, A.","Razak, I. A.","Helen-Ng, L.

Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, we recently demonstrated the presence of HPV in more than 50 of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients and that high-risk HPV is significantly associated with OSCC. Serological detection of HPV has been reported the most convenient method for detecting HPV. However, currently there is a lack of serological assays for the detection of the HPV. The HPV E6 viral oncoprotein is known to play crucial role in tumorigenesis, therefore detecting the presence of the E6 protein could be a useful biomarker for HPV detection.Methods: A pGEX plasmid containing HPV 16 E6 gene was ligated with KT3 oligonucleotide. Constructed plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli for production of the recombinant protein which was used as antigen in ELISA assay. ELISA was optimized using anti KT3 antibody to detect the recombinant antigen. HPV ELISA was performed on sera from 18 healthy and 15 OSCC patients obtained from the Malaysian Oral Cancer Database \u0026 Tissue Bank System (MOCDTBS) which is coordinated by Oral Cancer Research \u0026 Coordinating Centre (OCRCC). Sera that have net OD above calculated cutoff value were determined as HPV seropositive. Fisher\u0027s Exact test was used for statistical evaluation.Results: An ELISA method to detect the presence of HPV16 E6 protein was successfully developed. Using this method, 33.3 (5/15) of OSCC and 16.7 (3/18) of healthy patients were found to be HPV 16 seropositive. No significant association was found between HPV 16 seropositivity and OSCC occurrence (P value \u003d 0.428).Discussion: Although there is a trend to support our previous findings using PCR where a larger proportion of OSCC patients were HPV positive in comparison to healthy individuals, our results using ELISA method did not show any statistical significance. This remains to be tested in a larger sample set to confirm pur preliminary result that could more representative of our patient population.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wong, G. R.","Ha, K.

Dietary data were collected using food frequency questionnaire and factor analysis was performed on 15 food groups resulting in four principle factors/components being retained. The first factor \"preferred\" was characterized by fast food, fermented food, canned food, snacks high in fat and sugar, cooked and raw vegetables, and seafood.

Tobacco smoking is one of the most common risk factor associated with oral cancer. Objectives: To explore and identify differential genes expression associated with tobacco smoking. Methodology: Next generation sequencing using the Illumina Genome Analyzer was done to sequence five fresh frozen oral cancer tissue samples from smoking patients, two of which were former smoker and an additional 8 samples consisting of normal oral mucosal tissues from the alveolar mucosa of non-cancer patients where 4 were smokers and another 4 were non-smokers. The tissues and socio- demographic information were obtained from the Malaysian Oral Cancer Data and Tumour Bank System (MOCDTBS) at the Oral Cancer Research and Coordinating Centre (OCRCC). High quality poly A+ RNA was extracted from macrodissected tumour and normal epithelial tissue to obtain \u003e70. Validation of second generation sequencing was done using commercial and custom microarrays. Principle component analysis (PCA) was applied to the sequenced generated data. Results and discussion: PCA showed distinct clusters separating groups of current and former smokers. The former smoker who ceased smoking \u003e25 years clustered closely with normal non-smoker suggesting expression levels of some of the genes related to tobacco smoking could return to levels similar to never smokers upon cessation of smoking. When comparing differential gene expression between tumor in former and current smokers, ACTC1, MYH2, DES, MYBPH, MYLPF were the top 5 most down-regulated genes. Meanwhile, CYP2W1, FAIM2, OLFML1, KRT13 were found to be up-regulated when comparing differential gene expression between these groups (fold change \u003e 8).

Results: The ORL-48(T) cell line is immortal, 3T3- independent and grew as a monolayer with the doubling time of 48h. Immunohistochemistry staining of cytokeratins confirmed the cell line is of epithelial origin. Soft agar assays demonstrated that ORL-48(T) expressed a low degree of anchorage independency (CFE\u003c6). Karyotyping analysis revealed that ORL-48(T) is aneuploidy in which the number of chromosomes varied between 67 and 73. There is consistent trisomies of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16 and 18 and homogenously staining region on 4q suggesting gene amplification in this region. Sequencing of exons 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of p53 revealed a mutation resulting in a stop codon. Molecular analysis of p14INK4a indicates hypermethylation of the p14INK4a promoter. In contrast to normal human keratinocytes, MDM2 is overpressed in ORL-48(T). Microsatellite analysis of BAT26 indicated that ORL-48(T) is microsatellite stable and this was confirmed by western blots demonstrating the expression of both hMSH2 and hMLH1 mismatch repair proteins. Polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that ORL-48(T) was not infected with human papillomavirus (HPV).

All 3 cell lines grew as monolayers with doubling times ranging between 26.4 and 40.8 h and were immortal. Karyotyping confirmed that these cell lines were of human origin with multiple random losses and gains of entire chromosomes and regions of chromosomes. Immunohistochemistry staining of cytokeratins confirmed the epithelial origin of these cell lines, and the low degree of anchorage independency expressed by these cell lines suggests non-transformed phenotypes. Genetic analysis identified mutations in the p53 gene in all cell lines and hypermethylation of p16INK4a in ORL-48 and -136. Analysis of MDM2 and EGFR expression indicated MDM2 overexpression in ORL-48 and EGFR overexpression in ORL-136 in comparison to the protein levels in normal oral keratinocytes. Analysis of the BAT-26 polyadenine repeat sequence and MLH-1 and MSH-2 repair enzymes demonstrated that all 3 cell lines were microsatellite stable. The role of HPV in driving carcinogenesis in these tumours was negated by the absence of HPV.

Efforts in our laboratory have focused on the molecular profiling of oral cancer to understand the mechanisms underlying the disease. In a previous microarray study, we found Guanine nucleotide binding protein alpha-12 (GNA12) to be up-regulated in oral cancer. Materials and methods: In this study, we validated the expression of GNA12 at the mRNA level in 47 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and 18 non-malignant oral mucosa tissues, by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Further, GNA12 protein expression was accessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 44 tumors and 23 non-malignant oral mucosa tissues. Using OSCC cell lines, we examined the effects of GNA12 signaling by in vitro functional assays. Results: We demonstrated that GNA12 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated in OSCC in comparison to the non-malignant oral mucosa tissues. Consistently, high levels of GNA12 protein expression were detected in 75% of OSCC tissues, while the non-malignant tissues showed negative or weak expression. We demonstrated that expression of activated GNA12 (GQ231L) promoted oral cancer cell migration in a monolayer wound healing assay and cell invasion through the matrigel barrier, but cell proliferation was not changed. Correspondingly, exogenous expression of the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) blocked G12 family signaling through RhoA, which resulted in the inhibition of cancer cell migration and invasion. Discussion: In summary, we demonstrated for the first time in OSCC that GNA12 is over-expressed in a large percentage of these patients and notably, the over-expression drives migration and invasion of oral cancer cells. Taken together, this information indicates that targeting GNA12 could benefit oral cancer patients by preventing the spread of the disease.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gan, C. P.","Zain, R. B.","Abraham, M.

Betel quid chewing is a common habit widely practiced in Southern Asian populations. However, variations are seen in the content of a betel quid across the different countries. Factors associated with commencement and cessation of this habit has been numerously studied. Unfortunately, data on Malaysian population is non-existent. This study aims to determine the factors associated with the inception and also cessation of betel quid chewing behaviour among Malaysian adults. Method. This study is part of a nationwide survey on oral mucosal lesions carried out among 11,697 adults in all fourteen states in Malaysia. The questionnaire included sociodemographic information and details on betel quid chewing habit such as duration, type and frequency. The Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated and plotted to compare the rates for the commencement and cessation of betel quid chewing behaviour. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate the hazard rate ratios for factors related to commencement or cessation of this habit. Results. Of the total subjects, 8.2 were found to be betel quid chewers. This habit was more prevalent among females and, in terms of ethnicity, among the Indians and the Indigenous people of Sabah and Sarawak. Cessation of this habit was more commonly seen among males and the Chinese. Females were found to be significantly more likely to start (p \u003c 0.0001) and less likely to stop the quid chewing habit. Females, those over 40 years old, Indians and a history of smoking was found to significantly increase the likelihood of developing a quid chewing habit (p \u003c 0.0001). However, those who had stopped smoking were found to be significantly more likely to promote stopping the habit (p \u003d 0.0064). Cessation was also more likely to be seen among those who chewed less than 5 quids per day (p \u003c 0.05) and less likely to be seen among those who included areca nut and tobacco in their quid (p \u003c 0.0001). Conclusion. Factors that influence the development and cessation of this behaviour are gender, age, ethnicity, and also history of smoking habit while frequency and type of quid chewed are important factors for cessation of this habit.

Initially these lesions were subcategorized into four specific entities, namely fibrous epulis, fibroepithelial polyp, calcifying fibroblastic granuloma, and ossifying fibrous epulis. It was found that 46.5 of the lesions contained calcifications. The connective tissue was represented predominantly by either the collagenous type (50.5) or the mixed (cellular and collagenous) type (44.6). It was also found that 36 of the lesions were ulcerated, and, of these, 79.5 were associated with the cellular type of connective tissue and calcifications. In an attempt to subcategorize the fibrous lesions into specific entities, it was found that 32 cases (15.7) had mixed features. This fact supports the suggestion that these lesions are stages in the spectrum of a single disease process and should collectively be termed fibroblastic gingival lesions. However, it is also suggested that the two terms, namely peripheral fibroma and fibrous epulis with and without ossification, should be retained whereas the usage of other terminologies should be avoided.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zain, R.

In the west, smoking and alcohol consumption are considered to be the main risk factors whilst in India and southeast Asia, betel quid (BQ) chewing is predominant. In this study, we compared the gene expression patterns of oral cancers associated with BQ chewing to those caused by smoking using Affymetrix microarrays. We found that 281 genes were differentially expressed between OSCC and normal oral mucosa regardless of aetiological factors including MMP1, PLAU, MAGE-D4, GNA12, IFITM3 and NMU. Further, we identified 168 genes that were differentially expressed between the BQ and smoking groups including CXCL-9, TMPRSS2, CA12 and RNF24. The expression of these genes was validated using qPCR using independent tissue samples. The results demonstrate that whilst common genes/pathways contribute to the development of oral cancer, there are also other gene expression changes that are specific to certain risk factors. The findings suggest that different carcinogens activate or inhibit specific pathways during cancer development and progression. These unique gene expression profiles should be taken into consideration when developing biomarkers for future use in prognostic or therapeutic applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cheong, S.C.","Chandramouli, G.

Methods: A total of 44 cases of OSCC resected were included. The resected specimens were examined for the OSCC type, degree of differentiation, pattern of invasion (at the tumour invasive front), greatest dimension and the depth of stromal invasion. Where there is no neck resection, the clinical nodal status was obtained from the Oral Cancer database maintained at the University of Malaya Oral Cancer Research and Coordinating Centre (UM-OCRCC) while the histopathologic data were obtained from examination of the resected specimens of patients whose records were extracted from the UM-OCRCC. Results: Among 38 cases of conventional OSCC, 11 cases showed nodal metastasis (28.9 %); two out of 4 cases of basaloid SCC showed nodal metastasis (50%) and none of the papillary SCC (2 cases) showed nodal metastasis (0%). The occurrence of lymph nodes metastasis in well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated and poorly-differentiated OSCC are 17.6% (17 cases), 36.0% (25 cases) and 50.0% (2 cases) respectively. None of the cases with pattern of invasion Type 1 and 2 (cohesive) showed nodal metastasis.

However, it is not yet clear which type of stem cell sources are most potent and best for targeted therapy. Lack of understanding of nature of these cells and their lineage-specific propensity might hinder their full potential. Therefore, understanding the gene expression profile that indicates their lineage-specific proclivity is fundamental to the development of successful cell-based therapies. Methods: We compared proliferation rate, gene expression profile, and lineage-specific propensity of stem cells derived from human deciduous (SCD) and permanent teeth (DPSCs) over 5 passages. Results: The proliferation rate of SCD was higher (cell number, 25 × 106 cells/mL; percent colony-forming units [CFUs], 151.67 ± 10.5; percent cells in S/G2 phase, 12.4 ± 1.48) than that of DPSCs (cell number, 21 × 106 cells/mL; percent CFUs, 133 ± 17.62; percent cells in S/G2 phase, 10.4 ± 1.18). It was observed that fold expression of several pluripotent markers such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and REX1 were higher (\u003e2) in SCD as compared with DPSCs. However, DPSCs showed higher expression of neuroectodermal markers PAX6, GBX2, and nestin (fold expression \u003e100). Similarly, higher neurosphere formation and neuronal marker expression (NF, GFAP) were found in the differentiated DPSCs into neuron-like cells as compared with SCD. Conclusions: This study thus demonstrates that both SCD and DPSCs exhibit specific gene expression profile, with clear-cut inclination of DPSCs toward neuronal lineage.","bibo:AuthorList":["Govindasamy, V.","Abdullah, A.

We have previously shown that overexpression of MDM2 is a common event in oral cancers.

Logistic regression was adapted to calculate odds ratios for MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism from univariate and multivariable adjusted models. Our results suggest that MDM2 SNP309 does not confer increased risk to oral cancer (OR \u003d 1.55, 95% CI \u003d 0.77-3.11). However, the GG/TG genotype was associated with later disease onset in women above 55 years of age.

One such molecular marker is cyclin D1 which is a proto-oncogene located on 11q13 in humans. Objective: To explore the feasibility of using cyclin D1 as a prognostic marker in tongue and cheek SCC by the fluorescent-in-situ hybridization (FISH) method. Methods: Fifty paraffin-embedded samples (25 each of cheek and tongue SCCs) were obtained from the archives of the Oral Pathology Diagnostic Laboratory. Sociodemographic data, histopathologic diagnoses, lymph node status and survival data were obtained from the Malaysian Oral Cancer Database and Tissue Bank System (MOCDTBS)coordinated by the Oral Cancer Research and Coordinating Centre (OCRCC), University of Malaya. The FISH technique was used to detect the amplification of cyclin D1 using the Vysis protocol. Statistical correlations of cyclin D1 with site and lymph node status were analyzed using the Fisher exact test. Kaplan-Meier and Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) test were used to analyze cyclin D1 amplification and median survival time. Results: Positive amplification of cyclin D1 was detected in 72 (36) of OSCCs. Detection of positive amplification for cyclin D1 was observed in 88 (22) and 56 (14) of the tongue and cheek tumors, respectively, where the difference was statistically significant (P\u003d0.012). Lymph node metastasis of cheek SCCs showed a trend towards a significant association (P\u003d 0.098) with cyclin D1 amplification whereas the lymph node metastasis of tongue SCC was clearly not significant (P\u003d0.593).There was a statistically significant correlation between cyclin D1 positivity and survival rate (P\u003d0.009) for overall SCC cases and (P\u003c0.001) for cheek SCC cases. Conclusion: The present study found that cyclin D1 amplification may differ in different subsites of OSCC (tongue vs cheek) and its positive amplification implies an overall poor survival in OSCCs, particularly those arising in cheeks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mahdey, H.

The mean age of 276 subjects examined was 61.1±10.0 years. There were 23.6% men and 76.4% women. Among the subjects interviewed, 41.7% were smokers and 37.7% were quid chewers. The prevalence of OML was 20.3% while OPC was found in only 1.4% of the subjects examined. Among the quid chewers and non-quid chewers, the prevalence of OML was found to be 35.6% and 11% respectively. However ,the prevalence of OPC ( only leukoplakia and lichen planus were detected; cancer, erythroplakia and oral submucous fibrosis were absent) was equally low in both groups (1.9% among quid chewers and 1,2 % among non-quid chewers). Such low prevalence of OPC among Malay quid chewers, differed from reported higher prevalences of OPC in the Malaysian Indians and the indigenous people of Sarawak. A further analysis of the quid contents showed a low usage of tobacco (3.8%) in the quid mixtures chewed by these subjects as compared to the quid mixtures reportedly used by the Indians and the indigenous people of Sarawak. It is concluded that the lack of tobacco in the quid mixtures used by the Malays may be related to the low prevalence of OPC in Malay quid chewers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rahman, Z. A. A.","Zain, R.

This research is based on a total of 11,697 randomly selected Malaysian subjects with an age range of 25-115 years and a mean age of 44.5 +/- 13.9 years who were examined for oral mucosal lesions (ORAS). The prevalence of ORAS detected during the oral examination (average point prevalence) was found to be 0.5 (64 subjects). ORAS formed 5.7 of all lesions detected during the survey. The average point prevalence of ORAS was highest in the indigenous people of Sabah and Sarawak (1.2), followed by the Chinese (0.7), the Malays (0.5) and the Indians (0.1). This difference was statistically significant (p \u003c 0.001). A review of the English literature on the prevalence of ORAS revealed different prevalence types used by different researchers, namely average point prevalence (APP), self reported life-time prevalence (SLP) and self reported two-year prevalence (STP). The other objective of this paper was to present the different types of prevalence that have been reported in the literature and to discuss the usefulness of such prevalence types in relation to using epidemiology in deriving certain possible etiological associations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zain, R.

Aim: To review the clinicopathological features of persistent, multifocal oral VPL in a Malaysian population. Method: Patients with multiple biopsies of oral VPL were selected from histopathological records. Seven women and three men with diverse ethnic backgrounds were identified. New sections were made and re-examined by a single pathologist. Results: A total of 45 biopsies were reviewed. The mean age at first presentation was 62 years. In 70% of cases, lesions occurred in multiple sites synchronously. The most frequent sites affected were the mandibular gum/vestibule, buccal mucosa and the tongue. Indulgence in risk habits was an over-riding factor in 70% of patients. Surgery was the predominant mode of treatment and recurrences frequently occurred. With hindsight, four cases in this series were diagnosed as PVL. Conclusions: These findings support the existence of PVL as a clinicopathological entity in a Malaysian population. The diagnosis of PVL and institution of early aggressive treatment should be considered when oral VPL are encountered.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ghazali, N.","Zain, R. B.","Rahman, Z. A.

The crude and age-specific incidence rates were calculated based on the annual population census of Kelantan and this was standardised to the world population. Results: There were forty-three OC cases during that period. The incidence of OC was 6.1 per million annually (males, 1.4 per million; females, 1.0 per million). The age-standardised incidence was 1.7 per million. The main leading sites of OC were the gum and the buccal mucosa/vestibule/retromolar areas.

It is a useful marker for the proliferating fraction of cells in tissue specimens. The purpose of this study was to describe the expression of PCNA within epithelial linings of odontogenic cyst and to compare the proliferative activities of these lesion using PCNA labeling indices. A total of 61 cases of odontogenic cysts and unicystic ameloblastomas (18 radicular cysts, 16 dentigerous cysts, 15 odontogenic keratocysts (OKC) an 12 unicystic ameloblastomas) was studied. It was found that PCNA staining were distributed in the basal and supra basal cells for radicular cysts, dentigerous cysts and OKCs. For unicystic ameloblastoma, the PCNA nuclei were distributed in the cells at the periphery of ameloblastomatous islands and in the centrally located stellate-reticulum cell area. PCNA labeling index was highest in OKC (22.33 ± 4.07 %). Unicystic ameloblastoma with ameloblastomatous islands in the cystic wall also showed a high index (14.22 ± 3.42%) as compared to those with cystic tumor lining. In conclusion, this result supported previous reports that OKC is the most aggressive type of odontogenic cysts and the unicystic ameloblastoma with ameloblastomatous islands is more aggressive as compared to the other types of unicystis ameloblastoma.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sudiono, J.","Zain, R.

However no studies have been reported on prevalences of subjective radiographic features in these lesions except for the early assumption that a periapical cyst usually exhibit a radiopaque cortex. This study is conducted to evaluate the prevalences of several subjective radiographic features of periapical cysts and granulomas in the hope to identify features that maybe suggestive of either diagnosis. The results showed that a regular (circular or semi-circular) radiographic outline is likely to be a periapical cyst while an irregular radiographic outline is not indicative of either a cyst or a granuloma. The association between the regular/irregular radiographic outline and the type of periapical lesion was found to be statistically significant (p less than 0.001). The associations of two other radiographic features and the type of periapical lesion were found to be just statistically significant (p less than 0.01). These features are the symmetry/asymmetry of the radiolucency in relation to the apex and the funnel-shaped/angular-shaped extension of the radiolucency. The widely accepted criteria that the possession of a radiopaque cortex surrounding the radiolucency can discriminate between a periapical cyst and granuloma cannot be statistically supported in this study.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zain, R.

Methods: Five fresh frozen oral cancer tissue samples from smoking patients, with 2 samples of proximal normal were included in this study. An additional 8 samples consisting of normal oral mucosal tissues from the alveolar mucosa of non-cancer patients who had their wisdom tooth removed where 4 were smokers and another 4 were non-smokers was also included. The tissues and socio-demographic information were obtained from the Malaysian Oral Cancer Data and Tumour Bank System (MOCDTBS) at the Oral Cancer Research and Coordinating Centre (OCRCC). Manual macrodissection was used to obtain \u003e70% tumour or normal epithelial tissue. High quality poly A+ RNA was extracted from the macrodissected tissues and second generation sequencing was done using the Illumina Genome Analyzer. Validation of second generation sequencing was done using commercial and custom microarrays. Results: Among the differentially expressed genes, KRT76 which encodes a filament protein that is responsible for the structural integrity of epithelial cells was the most down-regulated gene when comparing all tumours to all normals (excluding proximal normals). KRT76 is the second most down-regulated gene when comparing differential expression between proximal normal and normal non-cancer samples. Further comparison of all tumors against all normals, including the proximal normals, still indicates down-regulation of KRT76, but to a much lesser degree. A similar pattern was also observed for other down-regulated genes such as the KRT2, KRT3, ANKS1B, CPLX2, FGB, HIST1H3A, HIST1H3G, HIST1H4I, LOR and ZFHX2.Conclusions: This pattern of partial cancerisation of proximal normal samples issuggestive of the possible presence of _field cancerisation’.Relevance: The ‘‘field cancerisation’’ theory was postulated by Slaughter whereby the occurrence of multiple independent primary tumours was explained by the fact that the upper aerodigestive tract is chronically exposed to carcinogens. Various conventional molecular methods including microarray based technologies have been applied. Nevertheless, there have been no reports utilizing second generation sequencing to elucidate differentially expressed genes in relation to _field cancerisation’ in oral carcinogenesis. Using second generation sequencing to discover genes involved in _field cancerisation’ may be useful in predicting the outcome of different management strategies for oral cancer patients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zain, R.

All the patients were chewers of betel quid containing betel leaves, areca nuts, lime and tobacco. The results obtained from this study were compared to similar lesions in smokers and non-quid users cited in the literature (Shrestha et al, Oral Oncol, 1994). An enhanced expression of TN-C was observed in epithelial connective tissue interface of quid associated hyperkeratotic and dyplastic mucosa. However, the expression was less extensive as compared to similar lesions among smokers or those without smoking or quid habits although the enhanced expression observed in the stromal tissue surrounding the carcinoma cells in carcinoma arising at sites where quids were often placed did not differ. Oral submucous fibrosis showed no or a faint linear immunoreactivity to an intense reactivity often abruptly ending at the epithelial-connective tissue interface. Areas of subepithelial hyalinization in oral submucous fibrosis remained unreactive. These variations in oral submucous fibrosis were observed in different areas of the same specimen. Oral squamous cell carcinoma, however, showed no difference in the expression of TN-C among these two groups of patients. The result of the present study suggest that epithelial hyperproliferation with or without dysplastic changes in quid related oral lesions may induce an altered epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and may be a factor in an enhanced expression of TH-C.

The incorporation of small amounts of the microcapsules did not affect the performance of the matrix material. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed excellent bonding of the microcapsules to the host material which is a characteristic of utter importance for maintaining the very good mechanical properties of a dental composite with self-healing ability.

However, the usage of DPSC in transplantation requires large-scale expansion to cater for the need for clinical quantity without compromising current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). Existing protocols for cell culturing make use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) as a nutritional supplement. Unfortunately, FBS is an undesirable additive to cells because it carries the risk of transmitting viral and prion diseases. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of human platelet lysate (HPL) as a substitute for FBS in a large-scale set-up. Methods. We expanded the DPSC in Dulbecco\u0027s modified Eagle\u0027s medium-knock-out (DMEM-KO) with either 10% FBS or 10% HPL, and studied the characteristics of DPSC at pre- (T25 culture flask) and post- (5-STACK chamber) large-scale expansion in terms of their identity, quality, functionality, molecular signatures and cytogenetic stability. Results. In both pre- and post-large-scale expansion, DPSC expanded in HPL showed extensive proliferation of cells (c. 2-fold) compared with FBS; the purity, immune phenotype, colony-forming unit potential and differentiation were comparable. Furthermore, to understand the gene expression profiling, the transcriptomes and cytogenetics of DPSC expanded under HPL and FBS were compared, revealing similar expression profiles. Conclusions. We present a highly economized expansion of DPSC in HPL, yielding double the amount of cells while retaining their basic characteristics during a shorter time period under cGMP conditions, making it suitable for therapeutic applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Govindasamy, V.","Ronald, V.

However, it is not yet clear which type of stem cell sources are most potent and best for targeted therapy. Lack of understanding of nature of these cells and their lineage-specific propensity might hinder their full potential. Therefore, understanding the gene expression profile that indicates their lineage-specific proclivity is fundamental to the development of successful cell-based therapies. Methods: We compared proliferation rate, gene expression profile, and lineage-specific propensity of stem cells derived from human deciduous (SCD) and permanent teeth (DPSCs) over 5 passages. Results: The proliferation rate of SCD was higher (cell number, 25 x 10(6) cells/mL; percent colony-forming units CFUs, 151.67 +/- 10.5; percent cells in S/G2 phase, 12.4 +/- 1.48) than that of DPSCs (cell number, 21 x 10(6) cells/mL; percent CFUs, 133 +/- 17.62; percent cells in S/G2 phase, 10.4 +/- 1.18). It was observed that fold expression of several pluripotent markers such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and REX1 were higher ({\\ensuremath{\u003e}}2) in SCD as compared with DPSCs. However, DPSCs showed higher expression of neuroectodermal markers PAX6, GBX2, and nestin (fold expression {\\ensuremath{\u003e}}100). Similarly, higher neurosphere formation and neuronal marker expression (NF, GFAP) were found in the differentiated DPSCs into neuron-like cells as compared with SCD. Conclusions: This study thus demonstrates that both SCD and DPSCs exhibit specific gene expression profile, with clear-cut inclination of DPSCs toward neuronal lineage.

One hundred and ten rectangular bar specimens were prepared for each materil and divided into 11 groups of 10 each. Test groups 1-6 were subjected to 0, 250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1000 thermal cycles respectively. Each thermal cycle consisted of 1 minute immersion time of 50 seconds per change. The control groups 7-11 were stored in distilled water at 370c for the equivalent time to complete 250, 500, 750, 1000 and 10000 thermal cycles respectively. All specimens were subjected to a 3 point bend test and loaded at a crosshead speed of 1mm/min on a an Inston Testing Machine. The flexural strength of all materials decreases with the number of cycles and length of water storage except for CC where the flexural strength increases during the earlier stages of thermocycling and water storage. The lowest flexural strength was observed in groups 6 and 11. One way analysis of varience showed that Group 1 was significantly different from groups 6 and 11 (P\u003c.05), however the thermally cycled and water storage groups were not different from each other for all materials tested. The decrease in flexural strength of all materials in the water storage groups (7-11) when compared to the 24 hour group (1) is related to weakening of resin-filler interface bu hydrolysis. While the decrease of the thermally cycled groups can be attributed to debongding of matrix-filler due to variation in coefficient of thermal expansion. It can be concluded that thermal changes does not reduce the flerxural strength of composites.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abu Kasim, N.H."],"dc:date":"1998-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1585723,"sim:weight":0.287183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The flexural strength of an experimental polymer prepared from MMA monomer modified with palm-oil polyol was compared to two commercial resins,namely the Lucitone 199Â? (Dentsply Trubyte, USA) and Impact (Ivoclar Vivadent, Liechtenstein). Methods: The experimental polymer was prepared by copolymerizing MMA monomer and palm oil polyol. The resulting polymer was cast into a plate form and sectioned using a precision diamond saw (Buhler, Germany) to form 10 specimens of dimension, 65mm x 11mm x 5mm. These specimens were then polished to achieve a nominal dimension of 64mm x 10mm x 3.3mm. Another 10 specimens were prepared using Lucitone 199Â? and Impact according to the manufacturers\u0027 instructions and were polished by the same procedure. Their flexural strengths were determined using a three point bend test on an Instron Universal Testing Machine (Anytown, Australia)according to the procedure of test method ISO 1567. Data obtained was analysed using Oneway ANOVA (SPSS 12.0) at 95 confidence interval. Results: The mean flexural strength of Lucitone 199Â? was 127.39MPa (Â±16.54), Impact was 177.57MPa (Â±11.44) and experimental polymer was 51.62MPa (Â±4.21). Although the experimental polymer has exhibited higher flexural strength than PMMA homopolymer, it has lower flexural strength when compared to Lucitone 199Â? and Impact denture base resins, both of which were filler-reinforced materials. Conclusions:In this preliminary study, the experimental polymer contained a significant proportion of non-petroleum based materials derived from palm oil. Its lower flexural strength is expected to be enhanced and improved through the incorporation of reinforcing fillers or fibers in future work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shahabudin, N.","Abu Kasim, N.H.","Gan, SN"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1585735,"sim:weight":0.597103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":655432,"sim:weight":0.407792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585734,"sim:weight":0.300255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6189762,"sim:weight":0.295635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":756229,"sim:weight":0.250607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585742,"sim:weight":0.247261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585736,"sim:weight":0.234202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585737,"sim:weight":0.219833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585738,"sim:weight":0.199596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585723,"sim:weight":0.198675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6189759,"sim:weight":0.194538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585740,"sim:weight":0.185739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585739,"sim:weight":0.18285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585743,"sim:weight":0.182186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5847957,"sim:weight":0.179224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":756324,"sim:weight":0.175765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585741,"sim:weight":0.160166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930233,"sim:weight":0.159607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98474,"sim:weight":0.141943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24739,"sim:weight":0.139106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Methods: A series of copolymerizations of palm oil polyol with MMA was performed in solution. The polyol was added from 40-20 , MMA from 20-40 , benzoyl peroxide as initiator was at 0.04 and toluene used as solvent was at 60 of the total weight. The copolymerization was carried out in a 500ml-round-bottom reaction flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, for 7.5 hour at 80Â?C, in a water bath. The yield of each copolymerization obtained was recorded and the conversion was estimated gravimetrically. Later, the polymers acquired were analyzed by FTIR. Results: The copolymerizations have achieved conversions that ranged from 24 to 95, where the higher conversion was obtained when the reactant mixture contain higher amount of MMA. The reaction produced a clear color, light-weighted copolymer that has the potential to be developed as denture material. The evidence of incorporation of the polyol into PMMA was given by the FTIR measurements, by comparing the spectrum of the copolymer to the spectrum of PMMA and polyol. Evaluations of the mechanical properties were currently being carried out. Conclusion: The new copolymers have potential of being developed into new dental materials. The branching structure of the copolymer was expected to improve the impact strength of PMMA. In addition, the palm oil based polyol was made from natural sustainable material.

The burs were then immediately immersed in Grotanat Drill Bath (ShÃ?lke \u0026 Mayr, Germany), Micro 10 (Unident, Swizerland), Gigasept FF (ShÃ?lke \u0026 Mayr, Germany), Lysetol AF (ShÃ?lke \u0026 Mayr, Germany) and 70 Isopropyl alcohol (J.Y. Baker, USA) according to the manufacturer\u0027s instructions. Each test groups consisted of 10 burs. Positive and negative control groups (n\u003d10) were also included in this study. The disinfecting ability of the disinfectants was evaluated using bacterial culture where presence and absence of bacterial colonies were noted. The cleaning ability was then assessed using scanning electron microscopy. Results: The results showed that the disinfecting ability of Grotanat Drill Bath was statistically significant when compared to all disinfectants evaluated, p\u003c0.05. There was also a significant difference between the positive and negative groups. Examination of scanning electron micrographs showed that Grotanat Drill Bath exhibited the best cleaning ability compared to the other disinfectants evaluated. A positive correlation between bacterial growth and cleaning ability of disinfectants was also evident. Conclusion: It can be concluded that Grotanat Drill Bath is an effective disinfectant for the disinfection and cleaning of round stainless steel burs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abu Kasim, N.H.","MOHAMID-YASIN, A."],"dc:date":"2004-09-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1585745,"sim:weight":0.221968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585723,"sim:weight":0.187575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585733,"sim:weight":0.182186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The radio-opacity and the size of fixed and removable dental prostheses in an animal carcass was investigated. Prostheses were placed one at a time in the oro-laryngopharynx or in tho trachea and the esophagus. Lateral radiographs were taken for each prosthesis in site. The radio-opacity and size of the prostheses on the radiograph was graded. Most of the prostheses investigated were radio-opaque though the removable prostheses were more likely to be radiolucent and differ in size. In a symptomatic patient with a missing dental prosthesis, a negative chest or abdominal radiograph does not exclude impaction, inhalation or ingestion. Further evaluation with endoscopy or even computed tomography may be essential to reduce the possibility of severe morbidity or even mortality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abu Kasim, N.H.","Abdullah, BII","Mahadevan, I."],"dc:date":"1998","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1585745,"sim:weight":0.299055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585723,"sim:weight":0.241526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177225,"sim:weight":0.174597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Materials and Methods: The sample comprised 150 pretreatment study casts with fully erupted and complete permanent dentitions from first molar to first molar, which were selected randomly from 1100 consecutively treated white orthodontic patients. The mesiodistal diameter tooth sizes were measured using digital calipers, and the Bolton analysis and the tooth size corrections were calculated by the Hamilton Arch Tooth System (HATS) software. Simple visual estimation of Bolton discrepancy was also performed. Results: In the sample group 17.4 had anterior tooth-width ratios and 5.4 had total arch ratios greater than 2 of Bolton\u0027s standard deviations from Bolton\u0027s mean. For the anterior analysis, correction greater than +/- 2 mm was required for 16 of patients in the upper arch or 9 in the lower arch. For the total arch analysis, the corresponding figures are 28 and 24. Conclusions: It is recommended that 2 mm of required tooth size correction is an appropriate threshold for clinical significance. A significant percentage of patients have a TSD of this size. Visual estimation of TSD has low sensitivity and specificity.

The authors argue that market researchers will serve their organizations and customers better if they take an active role updating the customer experience measurement commensurate with advances in the conceptualization of that which firms offer customers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maklan, Stan","Klaus, Philipp \"Phil\""],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":336741,"sim:weight":0.626474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336742,"sim:weight":0.62,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99215,"sim:weight":0.546607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336743,"sim:weight":0.528579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387042,"sim:weight":0.525294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98718,"sim:weight":0.461804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.414172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48237,"sim:weight":0.407489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46815,"sim:weight":0.403805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338059,"sim:weight":0.389323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336831,"sim:weight":0.387746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336748,"sim:weight":0.361964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.340904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.327702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.28501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.283636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.244033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.144995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":245573,"sim:weight":0.144172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333800,"sim:weight":0.122418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To study the epidemiology of patients who consumed Super Vasmol (a commonly used commercial hair dye), profile of patients referred to the ENT department, to find the effectiveness of supportive therapy and to compare between the tracheostomy and the non tracheostomy group, a retrospective study was conducted in patients who consumed Super Vasmol admitted over a year (April 2009 – March 2010) in a teaching hospital in South India. Out of the 108 patients 38 (35.2%) were males and 70 (64.8%) were females. 42 (38.9%) were in 21-25 age group. Patients who developed cervico-facial oedema, throat pain, burning sensation in the throat, change of voice, no voice and dyspnoea with stridor were referred to the ENT Department. 74 (68.5%) patients needed an ENT opinion. Cervico-facial oedema was the main clinical manifestation in 74 patients. 33 of them underwent tracheostomy. The mortality in 108 patients was 22.2% and after tracheostomy 21.2%. Purpose of the study is to create public awareness about the lethal effects of the hair dye, because it is a major health problem and to educate the public and the medical professional about the need for aggressive and early treatment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mary, Nirmala"],"dc:date":"2012-02-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.314003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.286491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.282783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.21224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8747712,"sim:weight":0.199557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.193513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.192096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.189908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98568,"sim:weight":0.186092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75002,"sim:weight":0.183484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.181121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75567,"sim:weight":0.180434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99377,"sim:weight":0.171438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501130,"sim:weight":0.167997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631565,"sim:weight":0.165514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76491,"sim:weight":0.165233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185982,"sim:weight":0.164376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.164039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.164039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.162498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Methods: We examined 120 ethnic Malay study models (60 maxillary, 60 mandibular) and 129 Malaysian Aboriginal study models (66 maxillary, 63 mandibular). We marked 18 buccal tips and incisor line angles on each model, and digitized them using 2-dimensional coordinate system. Dental arches were classified as square, ovoid, or tapered by printing the scanned images and superimposing Orthoform arch templates on them. Results: Th e most common maxillary arch shape in both ethnic groups was ovoid, as was the most common mandibular arch shape among ethnic Malay females. The rarest arch shape was square. Chi-square tests, indicated that only the distribution of the mandibular arch shape was signifi cantly diff erent between groups (p \u003d 0.040). However, when compared using independent t-tests, there was no difference in the mean value of arch width between groups. Arch shape distribution was not diff erent between genders of either ethnic group, except for the mandibular arch of ethnic Malays. Conclusions: Ethnic Malays and Malaysian Aborigines have similar dental arch dimensions and shapes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Othman, S.

The growing use of illicit ketamine among young adults poses a public health concern in Malaysia. In contrast to medical use of ketamine, illicit use has been reported to produce adverse effects on the urinary tract and, in particular the bladder. Approach and Key Findings. This case report describes a young Malay woman who developed severe bladder symptoms (urinary frequency) after consuming illicit ketamine. A history of illicit ketamine use was initially missed, and she was consequently diagnosed and treated for a urinary tract infection. Her symptoms persisted despite several courses of antibiotics. The patient was subsequently referred to an urologist where cystoscopic examination and biopsy of the bladder found changes consistent with interstitial cystitis. This was despite the absence of haematuria. Renal function was normal. Implication. The patient\u0027s ketamine use was the most likely cause for the urinary symptoms and bladder changes. Conclusion. Illicit ketamine use may lead to severe urinary tract problems that can be irreversible even after ketamine has ceased. Early diagnosis is critical although difficult when ketamine use is not divulged during the consultation with the physician. Physician consideration of this new clinical entity is important, particularly in cases where the symptoms do not resolve with usual treatment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Robson , Noorzurani","Vicknasingam, B.","Narayanan, S."],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":337471,"sim:weight":0.151305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Methadone, a pharmacological agent used to treat heroin dependence is relatively safe, but may cause cardiac arrhythmias in the concurrent presence of other risk factors. Approach and Key Findings. This case report highlights the risk of Torsade de Pointes, a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia, in a heroin-dependent patient receiving methadone substitution therapy who was prescribed itraconazole for vaginal thrush. The patient presented to the accident and emergency department for chest discomfort and an episode of syncope following two doses of itraconazole (200 mg). Electrocardiogram monitoring at the accident and emergency department showed prolonged rate-corrected QT interval leading to Torsade de Pointes. The patient was admitted for cardiac monitoring, and electrocardiogram returned to normal upon discontinuation of methadone. Implication. This cardiac arrhythmia was most likely as a result of a drug interaction between methadone and itraconazole because the patient presented with no other risk factors. Conclusion. Given the benefits of methadone as a substitution treatment for heroin-dependent individuals, the association between methadone and cardiac arrhythmias is of great concern. Physicians treating heroin-dependent patients on methadone substitution therapy should therefore be cautious of the potential risk of drug interactions that may lead to fatal cardiac arrhythmias.","bibo:AuthorList":["Robson , Noorzurani","Vicknasingam, B.","Narayanan, S."],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":51784,"sim:weight":0.1546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Having access to the MI profiles and learning strategies of learners could help the teachers in planning activities to connect both strategies and students’ talents and provide students with the best possible instruction. Thus, this study attempts to find out the relationship between the MI profiles and language learning strategies used by Iranian EFL high school students. Two hundred and twenty-nine students (121 males, 108 females) participated in the study. The instruments used to elicit information for this study were McKenzie’s (1999) MI inventory and the Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL) Questionnaire. The findings revealed that there is a low, positive correlation between the two variables of MI and learning strategies, r \u003d 0.24. In addition, it was found that there is a low, positive correlation between MI and different strategy types. The highest correlation was seen between meta-cognitive strategies and MI, followed by compensation and cognitive strategies.

Methods: Literature search using online databases PubMed, Scopus, National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) and Cochrane Controlled Trial Register regarding all cell based therapies and other interventions for chondral lesions was explored. Data on clinical outcome and repair quality were analyzed. Duplicates and irrelevant articles were omitted. Result: Seventeen (n\u003d17) studies were included in this review. Among the four trials on ACI versus mosaicplasty, 2 studies showed no differences in clinical scores, 1 suggested similar performance while the other suggested better results in tissue quality for ACI. A systematically performed assessment comparing ACI with microfracture shows better clinical outcomes and higher tissue quality after ACI. Studies comparing ACI with MACI or BMSC demonstrated similar results. Although many of these studies had substantial flaws, on the overall, the evidence comparing ACI with other treatment modalities shows better clinical outcomes and higher tissue quality. Conclusion: Despite significant differences between the methodologies employed by different researchers, we can conclude that all except 2 studies demonstrated ACI being the better treatment for cartilage defects. However final conclusions regarding long-term effects are still difficult and therefore future studies are needed to answer the long term effects of ACI.","bibo:AuthorList":["Naveen , Sangeetha","Robson , Noorzurani","Kamarul, Tunku"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study whereby the first 194 subjects diagnosed to have schizophrenia based on International Classification of Disease, 10th edition (ICD-10) criteria were taken from data registry of patients admitted to HBUK from January until February 2004. The subjects’ medical files were examined for documentation of substances abuse, aggression and accumulative duration of hospitalization. Results: The results showed the prevalence of substances misuse among patients with schizophrenia in general (including alcohol) was 24.7%. Cannabis 16.7%, alcohol 13.4%, opiates(heroin) 6.7%, Amphetamine type stimulants (amphetamine, metamphetamine, ecstacy) 5.7%, and other substances (benzodiazepine, solvents) 1.5%. Conclusion: There is higher prevalence of substance misuse in patients with schizophrenia as compared to general population. Male patients with history of substance misuse are more likely to have aggression than female.

As such there are similarities with the wider phenomena of organ-stealers around the world. This article, however, examines the cultural specifities of khasiri  beliefs and outlines important differences from these more generalised phenomena. Kharisiris steal fat, and by understanding the role of fat in Andean culture we understand better not only the phenomenon of the kharisiri, but also how he comes so horrifyingly to represent the \"racialized\" outsider. Moreover, such an analysis also illuminates how the distinction between Indian and non-Indian is understood emically and thus introduces a way of understanding differen ce that goes beyond analyses based on the categories of ethnicity, race, or class: that is, difference as a boundary between alterity and identity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Canessa, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2000-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1568297,"sim:weight":0.76861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13260,"sim:weight":0.378139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A charged pion is produced by adding a heavy-electron or positron in a tight orbit around the neutral core. Other mesons are found to be ordered assemblies of pionic-size masses, travelling in bound epicyclical orbits, with real intrinsic spin and angular momentum. These orbit dimensions are related to the mean lifetimes of the mesons through action integrals.

The objective of this study is to present the clinicopathological features of traumatic granulomas in some malaysian patients and to compare this data with data from other reported studies, which have been predominantly from Caucasian population. Biopsy records from 1985 to 1998 of 18 cases of traumatic granulomas were obtained. There were 13 male and 5 female patients. The granulomas occured in 38.9 Malay, 38.9 Chinese, 11.1 Indian and 11.1 other ethnic groups. The age of these patients range from 8 to 86 years, with mean of 41.9 Â± 17.7 years. The most common location for the lesions was the tongue, other locations were on the floor of mouth-tongue junction, retromolar region, buccal gingiva, lower lip, and anterior mandible with one case presenting with multiple ulcers in different locations. The provisional diagnoses given by the clinicians prior to biopsy include traumatic ulcer, squamous cell carcinoma, lichen planus, recurrent apthous ulcer, Wegener\u0027s granulomatosis, pyogenic granuloma, infectious ulcer (tuberculosis) and squamous cell papilloma. Some of the patients (66.7) have past/current medical condition, which include diseases of the endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular system, malignancy, venereal disease, autoimmune disease, and one Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive patient. Histologically, pseudoinvasion of plasma cells and histiocytes between muscle bundles are evident in all cases. Eosinophils are consistently found in all but one case.

More importantly, these studies act as independent validation for one another and strongly suggests that genes that were found to be up- or down-regulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) do indeed play a role in these cancers and therefore warrant further investigation to determine their utility as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for OSCC. We wanted to point out however, that the similarities between these 2 studies are not completely unexpected despite previous reports highlighting that the concordance between microarray studies are hard to achieve 3. The main disparities between datasets from microarray experiments have been attributed to the use of different microarray platforms and the heterogeneity of the tissue specimens that were used 4 and 5. Indeed, many microarray studies reported for the head and neck, used tissues from several distinct areas which have been reported to be genetically heterogeneous, and associated with different aetiologies 6 and 7. Given that both our studies used the DASL assay and tissues from the oral cavity (albeit from different sites-explained further below) the consistency of the genes that were identified should not come as a complete surprise. However, it is still intriguing that the similarities between these two studies were so close despite previous reports indicating that there are distinct differences between oral cancers associated with different aetiology 8 and 9, and reports describing the distinct genetic differences between subsites of the oral cavity 10, 11 and 12. Our previous study describing the differences in gene-expression patterns between oral cancers associated with betel quid chewing and smoking demonstrated that despite the differences seen, genetic changes common to all the cancers were also observed suggesting that there are core events and pathways that are important regardless of the aetiology or site of the cancer 8. Consistently, upon close examination of the genes that are most differentially expressed between our study and that of Rentoft et al. 1 5 of the top 10 over-lapping genes most differentially expressed were matrix metalloproteinases, whilst other genes include IL-8, CXCL-9 and BCL2A1, genes that were consistently up-regulated in many other microarray studies of the head and neck independent of the subsites of cancer 8, 12, 13 and 14. An unprecedented large overlap of genes between our study 2 and that of Rentoft and colleagues 1 may also be due to the smaller number of genes on the arrays that were used in these studies (502 genes), and that these genes were pre-selected based on their involvement in cancer development, whereas the majority of previous studies used platforms consisting of larger arrays and hence could capture much more of the heterogeneity typically observed in cancers. More recently, Illumina launched its whole genome DASL assay and it would be interesting to see if the similarities between buccal and tongue cancers still prevails. In conclusion, increasing number studies including the 2 compared here, strongly supports the use of FFPE tissues for gene expression studies using microarrays. The development of new technologies and statistical methods that addresses the challenges associated with using FFPE tissues, combined with the clinical information available with these specimens, will indeed facilitate the identification and discovery of clinically relevant gene signatures and biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve the management of cancers in general.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saleh, A.","Zain, R.

This study aims to identify dietary patterns of Malaysians, and establishing relationship between dietary pattern and oral cancer risk. Methods A hospital-based, case-control study was conducted on 300 Malaysians who seek treatment at participating hospitals between January 2003 and December 2010. The subjects consisted of 150 cases and 150 controls that were matched for gender, age (5 years) and ethnicity. Dietary intake was measured using Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Factor Analysis (FA) was performed to identify dietary consumptions pattern based on the intake of nine major food groups. Logistic Regression was done to compute the odds ratio (OR) for the components retained by FA. Results: FA had identified four patterns that accounted for 69.4% of total variability within the sample. The first pattern labeled as ‘modern’ was loaded with processed foods and snacks intakes whereas the second pattern ‘prudent’ was characterized by the intakes of fruits and vegetables. The third pattern ‘traditional’ consisted of beverages and starches intakes while the fourth pattern ‘combination’ was loaded with intakes of dairy foods, fermented foods and meat/byproducts. A significant reduced risk was found for ‘prudent’ (aOR 0.42, 95%CI: 0.21–0.83, p \u003c 0.05), whereas a significant increased risk was found for both ‘traditional’ (aOR 2.06, 95%CI: 1.05–4.02) and ‘combination’ (aOR 3.45, 95%CI: 1.75–6.77, p \u003c 0.05) pattern. Discussion: These findings suggest that intake of ‘prudent’ pattern may confer protection against oral cancer risk of up to 58% whereas the highest consumption of both ‘traditional’ and ‘combination’ pattern may induce twice and thrice the risk of oral cancer. FA was also found to be a useful tool to identify dietary pattern and its relationship with oral cancer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Helen-Ng, L. C.","Ishak, I. A.","Ghani, W. M.

While osseointegration provides initial success, the biological seal of the peri-implant soft tissue is crucial for maintaining the long term success of implants. Most studies of the biological seal of peri-implant tissues are based on animal or monolayer cell culture models. To understand the mechanisms of soft tissue attachment and the factors affecting the integrity of the soft tissue around the implants, it is essential to obtain good quality histological sections for microscopic examination. The nature of the specimens, however, which consist of both metal implant and soft peri-implant tissues, poses difficulties in preparing the specimens for histomorphometric analysis of the implant-soft tissue interface. We review various methods that have been used for the implant-tissue interface investigation with particular focus on the soft tissue. The different methods are classified and the advantages and limitations of the different techniques are highlighted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chai, W. L.","Moharamzadeh, K.","Brook, I.

One or more anterior loops were visible in 39 (40.2) radiographs encompassing 66 sites (34.4). Interestingly, anterior loops were most commonly observed bilaterally, followed by on the right side of the mandible only. An anterior loop on the left side only was observed in just 1 radiograph. Visibility of anterior loops reduced as the age of subjects increased. More than half (58.1) of subjects aged 20-29 years exhibited at least one anterior loop; this gradually reduced to only 15 percent of subjects aged 50 and older.

Using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), this study aims to determine a safe zone for bone graft harvesting that avoids injuring this nerve. Methods: Sixty CBCT examinations of patients were included in this study. The examinations were taken using the i-CAT CBCT imaging system, applying a standardized exposure protocol. Image reconstruction from the raw data was performed using the SimPlant dental implant software. The distances of mandibular incisive canal (MIC) to the inferior border and the labial and lingual cortices of the mandible were measured at 3, 5, 7 and 9 mm mesial to the mental foramen. Results: The MIC was visible in all (100) CBCT images. The median distance and interquartile range from the lower border of the mandible was 9.86 (2.51) mm, curving downwards toward the inferior mandibular border at the symphysis menti. It was located closer to the buccal border of the mandible (3.15 1.28 mm) than lingual cortex (4.78 2.0 mm). The MIC curves toward the lingual side at the symphysis menti. There was gender difference in a number of these measurements. Current recommendation for chin bone graft harvesting can be applied to Asian subjects. Conclusions: While acknowledging that there is human variability, this study provides an accurate anatomic location of the MIC, which in turn helps to determine a safe zone for chin bone graft harvesting. This information can become a useful guide in centers where CBCT is not available.

The median CAP modulus ratio in the 600 mM M6P group was 0.44, which was significantly higher than in the placebo group (0.24, P\u003d0.012: Kruskal-Wallis test). Conduction velocities were also faster in the 600 mM M6P group (median 30 m s(-1)) than in the placebo group (median 27.8 m s(-1); P\u003d0.0197: Kruskal-Wallis test). None of the other treated groups were significantly different from the placebo, and all had significantly lower CAP ratios than the sham controls (P\u003c0.05). All repair groups had a significantly higher PAS for collagen than sham controls. We conclude that the administration of 600 mM mannose-6-phosphate to a nerve repair site enhances; axonal regeneration. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This case report describes surgical treatment for paresthesia caused by a compressive phenomenon within the mandibular canal. The cause of the compression, a broken instrument left in the patient\u0027s mouth during previous endodontic therapy, was identified during routine radiography and computed tomography. Once the foreign object was removed by surgery, the paresthesia resolved quickly. This case highlights the potential for an iatrogenic mechanical cause of paresthesia. Comment : The article by Marques and Gomes (J Can Dent Assoc 2011;77:b34) caught my attention. For your information, there is almost an almost similar case reported recently, but with dysesthesia.1 It is fortunate that the patient in the current case has less severe symptoms (occasional numbness of her left lip and a small part of her chin, and a tingling sensation in the vestibular gingival). What I can deduce from the radiographs shown is that the file was actually lodged onto the wall of the periapical defect and the mandibular canal, and because of this the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) was spared direct injury. Ikeda et al.2 had shown that there is room between the IAN and the canal. However, as reported by the Marques and Gomes, her symptoms were more aggravated in the morning and during stressful situations. This may be a result of fluid accumulation in the morning, or during any sympathetic (stressful) event, that may result in vasodilatation, and hence compression within the narrow mandibular canal that usually average 3.4 + 0.5 mm in diameter. 2,3 I hope this opinion is of help.

The aim of this study was to quantify histomorphometrically the structural changes in neural tissue that result from repair, and determine the effect of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), a scar-reducing agent previously shown to enhance regeneration. In anaesthetised C57-black-6 mice, the left sciatic nerve was sectioned and repaired using four epineurial sutures. Either 100 mu L of 600 mM M6P (five animals) or 100 mu L of phosphate-buffered saline (placebo controls, five animals) was injected into and around the nerve repair site. A further group acted as sham-operated controls. After recovery for 6 weeks, the nerve was harvested for analysis using light and electron microscopy. Analysis revealed that when compared with sham controls, myelinated axons had smaller diameters both proximal and distal to the repair. Myelinated axon counts, axonal density and size all decreased across the repair site. There were normal numbers and densities of non-myelinated axons both proximal and distal to the repair. However, there were more Remak bundles distal to the repair site, and fewer non-myelinated axons per Remak bundle. Application of M6P did not affect any of these parameters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ngeow, W.C.","Atkins, S.","Morgan, C. R.","Metcalfe, A. D.","Boissonade, F. M.","Loescher, A. R.","Robinson, P.

In anaesthetised C57-Black-6 mice, the left sciatic nerve was sectioned and repaired using 4 epineurial sutures. Either 100 mu l of 600 mM Mannose-6-Phosphate (29 animals), or 100 mu l of phosphate buffered saline as a placebo control (29 animals), was injected into and around the nerve repair site. A further group acted as sham-operated controls. After 6 or 12 weeks of recovery the extent of regeneration was assessed electrophysiologically and the percentage area of collagen staining at the repair site was analysed using picrosirius red and image analysis. Gait analysis was undertaken pre-operatively and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks postoperatively, to assess functional recovery. At 6 weeks the compound action potentials recorded from the regenerated nerves in the M6P group were significantly larger than in the placebo controls (P\u003d0.015), and the conduction velocities were significantly faster (P\u003d0.005), but there were no significant differences between these groups at 12 weeks. Gait analysis suggested better early functional recovery in the M6P group. In both repair groups there was a significant reduction in collagen staining between 6 and 12 weeks, suggestive of scar remodelling. We conclude that the normal scar remodelling process aids long term recovery in repaired nerves. Administration of 600 mM M6P to the nerve repair site enhances nerve regeneration and functional recovery in the early stages, and may lead to improved outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Possible complications affecting the eyes include blurring of vision, diplopia, mydriasis, palpebral ptosis and amaurosis ( temporary or permanent).

Two patients developed transient loss of power of accommodation of the eye resulting in blurred vision after routine inferior alveolar nerve blocks on the ipsilateral side. Clear vision returned within 10 - 15 minutes after completion of the blocks. The possible explanation for this phenomenon is accidental injection into the neurovascular bundle of local anesthetic agents, which were carried via the blood to the orbital region. This resulted in paralysis of a branch of cranial nerve III, the short ciliary nerves that innervate the ciliary muscle, which controls accommodation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ngeow, W.C.","Shim, C.

Methods: The study group consisted of convenient samples of 100 healthy volunteers (aged 18-25 years), with an equal number of female and male subjects who had no history of mixed racial parentage. 22 linear measurements were taken twice from 22 landmarks over six craniofacial regions. Results: The Malays shared many similar sizes of measurements with the Singaporean Chinese. Their left eye fissure length and mouth width (ch-ch) were almost identical for both genders. However, Malay females had an upper lip height (sn-sto) (left) and ear width (pra-pa) similar to Singaporean Chinese females. Six other measurements, viz. the head width (eu-eu), head circumference (on-op), face height (n-gn), lower face height (sn-gn), (left) eye fissure height (ps-pi), cutaneous upper lip height (sn-ls) and cutaneous upper lip height (ls-sto), were 0.4-4.3 mm less in the Malays. Measurements for another four parameters, viz. the length of the head (g-op), biocular width (ex-ex), lower vermillion height (sto-li) and (left) ear length (sa-sba), were 0.5-3.6 mm higher in the Malays. Only three measurements were obviously different; the height of the head (vn) and intercanthal width (en-en), were lower, and the protrusion of the nasal tip (sn-prn) was higher in the Malays. Conclusion: These findings suggest that three features, i.e. the height of the head (v-n), intercanthal width (en-en) and protrusion of the nasal tip (sn-prn) may be useful in differentiating a Malay face from a Singaporean Chinese one.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ngeow, W.C.","Aljunid, S.

Under anaesthesia the nerve was transected, repaired using four epineurial sutures, and 100 mu l of either triamcinolone acetonide (1 mg/100 mu l), an interleukin-10 peptide fragment: (125 ng/100 mu l or 500 ng/100 mu l) or mannose-6-phosphate (M6P, 200 mM or 600 mM) was injected into and around the nerve. After 6 weeks the extent of regeneration was assessed electrophysiologically by determining the ratio of the compound action potential (CAP) modulus evoked by electrical stimulation of the nerve 2 mm distal or proximal to the repair site. The conduction velocity of the fastest components in the CAP was also calculated. The percentage area of collagen staining (PAS) at the repair site was analysed using Picrosirius Red and image analysis. Comparisons were made with a placebo group (100 mu l of phosphate buffered saline) and sham-operated controls. The median CAP modulus ratio in the 600 mM M6P group was 0.44, which was significantly higher than in the placebo group (0.24, P\u003d0.012: Kruskal-Wallis test). Conduction velocities were also faster in the 600 mM M6P group (median 30 m s(-1)) than in the placebo group (median 27.8 m s(-1); P\u003d0.0197: Kruskal-Wallis test). None of the other treated groups were significantly different from the placebo, and all had significantly lower CAP ratios than the sham controls (P\u003c0.05). All repair groups had a significantly higher PAS for collagen than sham controls. We conclude that the administration of 600 mM mannose-6-phosphate to a nerve repair site enhances; axonal regeneration. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of convenient samples of 100 healthy volunteers, with equal number of female and male subjects who had no history of mixed racial-parentage. Twenty-two linear measurements were taken twice from 28 landmarks over six craniofacial regions. The methodology and evaluation of indices of the craniofacial region was adapted from Hajnis et al. Results: The minimum measurements are always contributed by the female Indian except for the nose height (n-sn), (left) eye fissure length (ex-en), upper vermillion height (ls-sto), and lower vermillion height (sto-li). There is a gender difference in all the measurements except the (left) eye fissure height (independent t-test; P \u003c 0.05). The Malaysian Indians exhibit some North American White Caucasian (NAWC) features in all regions. The cephalic index indicates a brachycephalic or relatively short wide head with a tendency towards mesocephaly. From the low nasal index, the Malaysian Indian female have a nose that is narrow or leptorrhin similar to the NAWCs. The lower value of the upper lip height to mouth width index in the Indian female indicates a relatively shorter upper lip height compared to the mouth width, also similar to the NAWC. Conclusion: This study establishes the craniofacial anthropometric norms of the Malaysian Indian over 22 parameters. Male in general has a significantly higher measurement than female.

In another 0.24 of cases in the same study, mental paresthesia was a complication of root canal treatment (caused by severe overfill in one case and iatrogenic perforation of mechanical instrumentation through the root and into the mental nerve in the second case).1 The incidence of mental paresthesia resulting from orthodontic, periodontal and surgical misadventure cannot be determined but is presumably low, as most such cases have been reported as individual case reports. In endodontology, elimination of infection from the pulp and dentin followed by adequate intracanal preparation and proper sealing constitute the basic principles of root canal treatment. Ideally, mechanical preparation and filling should be limited to the root canal, as overinstrumentation or extrusion of chemical fillings beyond the apical foramen to the adjacent nerve may give rise to neurosensory disturbances such as anesthesia, paresthesia or dysesthesia.5 Unfortunately, cases of endodontic extrusion of various filling or irrigation agents continue to be reported, despite recent advances in endodontology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ngeow, W.C."],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1053464,"sim:weight":0.280015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1054648,"sim:weight":0.194621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734025,"sim:weight":0.173162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2832491,"sim:weight":0.173162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2832464,"sim:weight":0.172308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734007,"sim:weight":0.158089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9612383,"sim:weight":0.1411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848820,"sim:weight":0.130679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734023,"sim:weight":0.119265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108928,"sim:weight":0.115607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9612384,"sim:weight":0.0885693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9612379,"sim:weight":0.0692379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this study was to examine the ultrastructural features of soft tissue attachment to various titanium (Ti) implant surfaces based on the 3D OMM. Two techniques, that is, focus ion beam (FIB) and electropolishing techniques were used to prepare specimens for transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis of the interface. The 3D OM consisting of both epithelial and connective tissue layers was constructed by co-culturing human oral keratinocytes and fibroblasts onto an acellular dermis scaffold. Four types of Ti surface topographies were tested: polished, machined (turned), sandblasted, and TiUnite. The specimens were then processed for TEM examination using FIB (Ti remained) and electropolishing (Ti removed) techniques. The FIB sections showed some artifact and lack of details of ultrastructural features. In contrast, the ultrathin sections prepared from the electropolishing technique showed a residual Ti oxide layer, which preserved the details for intact ultrastructural interface analysis. There was evidence of hemidesmosome-like structures at the interface on the four types of Ti surfaces, which suggests that the tissue-engineered oral mucosa formed epithelial attachments on the Ti surfaces.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chai, W.

The roots were mounted in clear resin blocks and sectioned transversely at 1-mm intervals. A total of 154 cross-sections were evaluated with an image analyzer. Twelve different longitudinal canal configurations were identified. The most prevalent were types 1-2 and 1-2-1 with each type occurring in four roots. Evaluation of the cross-sectional morphology showed that the configurations were complete \"C\" (27), incomplete C (64), and non-C (9). The mean value for the minimum width of the lingual canal wall was 0.58 Â± 0.21 mm and the buccal wall was 0.96 ± 0.26 mm. This suggests that there is a higher risk of root perforation at the thinner lingual walls of C-shaped canals during shaping and post canal preparation procedures. Both buccal and lingual canal walls were frequently narrower at mesial locations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chai, W. L.","Thong, Y.

The participants were 128 randomly chosen pre-university students (grade12, 18-19 years old) of both genders studying in Tehran in the academic year 2008-2009. Three instruments were utilized in this study: 1) a demographic questionnaire; 2) the Persian version of Mckenzie’s MI Inventory; and 3) a standardized reading proficiency test which was selected from retrieved paper-based TOEFL® tests. Results of the correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between the two variables of MI and reading scores of the students. Furthermore, the results of the correlation analysis revealed that there was a low significant, negative relationship between musical-rhythmic intelligence and reading which suggests that when the reading score of a student increases, musical-rhythmic intelligence of the same student decreases and vice versa. Overall, three categories of MI (musical-rhythmic, verbal-linguistic, bodily-kinesthetic) were found to be predictive of reading proficiency.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hajhashemi, Karim","Wong, Bee Eng"],"dc:date":"2012-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5066820,"sim:weight":0.429887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5066852,"sim:weight":0.386048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27091,"sim:weight":0.367821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5066982,"sim:weight":0.317405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108924,"sim:weight":0.274624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107419,"sim:weight":0.245364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5065805,"sim:weight":0.239772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5067051,"sim:weight":0.234969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108385,"sim:weight":0.221185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84857,"sim:weight":0.221055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108301,"sim:weight":0.208072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85336,"sim:weight":0.191919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86005,"sim:weight":0.178175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654023,"sim:weight":0.167567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108717,"sim:weight":0.159506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.150709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5066538,"sim:weight":0.135712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85995,"sim:weight":0.0920336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":2832498,"ep:Repository":87,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The transition to harm reduction: Understanding the role of non-governmental organisations in Malaysia","bibo:abstract":"Background: The transition of drug policy from prohibition to harm reduction has never been easy. The deeply entrenched belief in prohibition shared by policy makers and religious leaders provided little room for alternatives, and change came only slowly. The non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Malaysia played a pivotal role in effecting such a change. Understanding how they did so may be instructive for other similarly placed countries. Methods: Data collected via reviews of published secondary sources, media reports and in-depth interviews with pioneers of harm reduction drawn from NGOs, medical practitioners and the police were analysed to construct the paper. Results: The policy change was the outcome of competition between three groups in the drug policy subsystem - the state, the Muslim religious lobby and the NGOs. Developments such as the poor outcomes from the prohibition programmes and the outbreak of HIV/AIDS did not change policy but did lead to a rethink of core beliefs in the state alliance and spawned a state-NGO partnership. The subsequent failure to meet the Millennium Development Goal with respect to HIV/AIDS in 2005 - was seen as a failure of the Health Ministry which then led the final charge for a policy change arguing that a health crisis was imminent. The NGOs played a pivotal role in this process by educating their partners in the state coalition, by drawing academics and medical practitioners into advocacy and by engaging the religious lobby (albeit with varying success). They were also frontline players in implementing harm reduction programmes and successfully deflected criticisms from unconvinced Islamic groups away from the state. Conclusion: Given their central role in the needle-syringe exchange programme, the NGOs are well positioned to convince injecting drug users to opt for voluntary medical treatment. This can potentially reduce both the harm from drug use and the prevalence of it. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, being ‘away’ meant that many heroin addicts faced employment problems and family relationship difficulties upon completing the in-house rehabilitation. However, recently, the concerted efforts by various government and non-government organisations, and the acknowledgement that heroin addiction is a medical illness has resulted in a revamp to approaching treatment of heroin addiction. At present, methadone substitution programmes have been offered as part of treatment programme for heroin addicts in Malaysia.

One  likely reason  for this is the difficulty  in collecting subjective human similarity judgments over a large database of textures. A common  approach is to carry  out a free-sorting experiment to obtain a similarity matrix which can then be mapped onto a low dimensional space using techniques such as  MDS  or  Isomap.    This  results   in  a  Euclidean space  in which  textures are  represented as points, and  the  distance between  two points  is taken to represent the perceptual visual  dissimilarity between  the associated pair  of textures. However,  it  is unknown if such  a  metric  can  generalise  to predict human texture judgements in other tasks, or even if similarity judgements are metric  at all.  In this study  we investigate this question by carrying out an experiment using a  pair-of-pairs paradigm and  compare  these results  to  the predictions made  by  a low dimensional model  (d  \u003d 3) obtained from a free-sorting experiment and find that it agrees with  the  judgements made  by participants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clarke, Alasdair D.

Through series of psychophysical experiments, we investigated effects of various factors on human perception of directionality of synthetic random-phase textured surfaces (see Figure 1) defined by mathematical model. The parameters of the surface model were varied to generate height maps of different directional surfaces, which were then rendered and animated in real-time with controlled illumination. Observers were asked to provide their responses about the directionality of these surfaces during psychophysical experiments. The responses were used to derive a perceptual scale of directionality (perceived directionality) that could be related to parameters of surface model. Statistical tests were carried out to determine if the differences in perceived directionality due to change in the values of parameters are significant.\r\nThe parameters, whose effects were investigated, are: angular variance (σ2), RMS roughness (δ), central radial frequency (fc) and Bandwidth (Bw). It was found that all four parameters have significant effect on human perception of directionality when their separate effects were investigated and only first three parameters have significant effect when their combined effects were investigated. In the first case, each parameter is varied while holding the other constant and in the second case, all are varied together in one experiment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shah, Pratik","Chantler, Mike","Green, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2012-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2832512,"sim:weight":0.718253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934481,"sim:weight":0.270157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227340,"sim:weight":0.228767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934910,"sim:weight":0.221487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98644,"sim:weight":0.219328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147453,"sim:weight":0.219126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85172,"sim:weight":0.205148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176864,"sim:weight":0.200759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934124,"sim:weight":0.185161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56544,"sim:weight":0.177517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An HDR real-world environment map was used to provide complex illumination and a physically- based path tracer was used for rendering the stimuli. Each simulated surface was rotated about its vertical axis to generate an animated stimulus. Eight observers took part in a 2AFC experiment, and the results were tested against conjoint measurement models. We found that the perceived gloss changes non-monotonically with β (an asymmetric bell curve), and monotonically with α.

For scenes with appropriately  placed  foreground  and background,  fake tilt shift (FTS) effects can be achieved by applying blur gradients  to the upper and lower parts of a conventional photograph. Either way, the treatment causes real scenes to look like small-scale models. This happens because the blur produces a shallow depth of field, which  makes  the focused  object  appear  close,  which  means  it must also be small to be within view. Previous attempts to study this FTS miniaturization  used subjective  measures  of perceived distance,  but these are complicated  by the observer’s  choice of cognitive strategy or interpretation  of instructions. We improved on  this  method  here  by  devising  a  2AFC  performance   task where participants viewed pairs of achromatic railway scenes for 5 seconds. One scene was always real and the other was always a detailed  1:76 scale model  (see Figure  1) and observers  were informed of this. Their task was to decide which of the two was the real full-scale  scene.  There  were  six treatments  of the real photographs:  null,  total  blur,  FTS  blur,  inverse  FTS  blur  (i.e. blurred across the middle and sharp at the top and bottom), orthogonally   oriented   FTS  blur  (i.e.  the  blur  gradient   was orthogonal  to the ground plane) and FTS blur with no gradient (i.e. a strip  of focus  through  a blurred  image).  Each  of 6 real photographs  was given each of the treatments  and compared  to each   of   6   model   photographs.    Each   of   108   participants performed 6 trials in a random order. For the null treatment, observers  detected  reality  reliably,  whereas  for  FTS  blur  with and without gradients, the model world was mistaken for reality (i.e.  percent  correct  was  significantly  less  than  50%, corresponding  with negative d-prime). Participants  were around chance for the other treatments. We conclude that the most important factor for achieving FTS miniaturization  is the correct alignment of the treatment with the subject/ground  plane, not the inclusion of a blur gradient.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meese, Tim S","Baker, Daniel H","Summers, Robert J"],"dc:date":"2012-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176871,"sim:weight":0.294098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.196387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734377,"sim:weight":0.176194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176864,"sim:weight":0.158385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98730,"sim:weight":0.157722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.153744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86026,"sim:weight":0.149628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28130,"sim:weight":0.12373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734386,"sim:weight":0.101516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Monte-Carlo computational simulations were previously carried out using a model of an ideal observer. The results showed that the proportion of paired comparisons that is included is more critical than the number of observers who make those observations. This work aims to test the results from the computational simulation with 25 real observers and 10 stimuli from the gray scale. The psychophysical data suggest that when each observer evaluates the same pairs, accuracy of the derived scale values increases with the proportion of pairs evaluated and the number of observers; the proportion of pairs is, however, more critical and this agrees with the results of the simulation. The psychophysical data also suggest when the each observer estimates a different pairs (albeit with the same proportion of pairs being evaluated) the accuracy of scale values does not always increase monotonically with the number of pairs being evaluated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Li, Yuan","Westland, Stephen","Cheung, Vien"],"dc:date":"2012-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4181792,"sim:weight":0.367785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.364098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.352949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.348218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.348218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.343802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.343802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.331915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85172,"sim:weight":0.327709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98622,"sim:weight":0.325696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.31239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.31239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.295264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159853,"sim:weight":0.283979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.265145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76432,"sim:weight":0.261023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1348058,"sim:weight":0.254498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.250582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98730,"sim:weight":0.248438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933744,"sim:weight":0.247527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

My  previous presentations at CIE Expert Symposia have focused on the measurement  and  characterisation  of dental  fluorosis  (i.e.  white mottling on the teeth caused by the ingestion of too much fluoride in childhood)  and  post-surgical  facial  scarring  ([1],  [2]).  In this presentation,  however,  I  wish  to  broaden  the  focus  to  include other work from my laboratory on emotional aspects of colour processing  and perceptual  processing  in autism. The issue I wish to   address   is   the   importance   of   verbal   descriptions   of   our perceptions  in understanding  how to solve a variety of puzzles in perception,  and  how  we  might  take  this  idea  further  in  future research.\r\nBeginning  with  the work  on fluorosis,  the specific  remit  was  to solve a practical  problem:  to what extent  are teenagers  bothered by having dental fluorosis? Previous research in public health dentistry had suggested that the white mottling on the teeth which can result from mild fluorosis was actually desirable to some teenagers   because   it  made  their  teeth  look  whiter  and  more “sparkly”. We addressed this question by producing digital simulations  of different  levels  of fluorosis  and embedding  these simulations   into  a  web-site.   The  key  question   we  asked  our (teenage)  participants  was: Is this appearance  acceptable  or not? Unsurprisingly,  ratings of acceptability  decreased  with increasing fluorosis  level,  although  this  dependence  went  away  at  longer viewing distances (corresponding  approximately  to conversational distance). However, there was a strong baseline lack of tolerance for  seeing  anybody’s  teeth  close-up  which  was  problematic  for our measurements.\r\nWith the work on post-surgical  facial scarring again the remit was a practical one: to quantify  the difference  in colour between  scar and  surrounding  skin.  Here  again,  we  ran  into  difficult  issues having collected the data. Scars are by no means homogeneously or consistently coloured and differ from surrounding skin in much more  than  just  their  colour.     Another   issue  was  that  whilst individuals  have no problem  identifying  the presence  and extent of  a  scar  it  is  much  harder  to  do  that  in  a  meaningful   way objectively.  We  were  forced,  therefore,  into  combining  colour with texture measurement  in order to attempt  to characterise  the scars  automatically  and  also  using  panels  of  observers  to  draw around  the  scars  on  a  touch  screen  to  give  us  some  idea  of “ground truth” for our measurements. This work illustrates the usefulness  of consensus  coding in visual appearance  research.  In essence, the relevant adjective to describe our stimuli was “scarriness”,  which  refers  to that combination  of texture,  colour and 3D shape that we call scarring. However, in additional experiments  we  also  asked  participants  to  describe  the  scars  in their own words. Whilst many colour, texture and 3D shape\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndescriptors  were  used,  other  words  like  “delicate”  and  “tender” refer to more  empathic  possibilities,  closer  to the CIE’s  idea of “total” visual appearance ([3]).\r\nThis leads us onto aesthetic aspects of visual perception.  There is a growing  body  of  literature  on  the  aesthetic  aspects  of  colour perception   (see,  [4]),  which  is  beginning  to  be  extended  into visual appearance  qualities such as texture (e.g. [5]). Participants have   no   difficulty   in   specifying   not  only   what   their   “most preferred” colour is, but also which they find most pleasant, unpleasant, lively or calming. There is also a surprising consensus on which  colours  make us feel happy and sad.   This fascinating area of research  is also beginning  to look carefully  at individual differences, especially those between males and females, different cultures  and  different  age  groups.  These  groups  can  differ  not only in what their responses  are, but also in how much  they are influenced by suggestion and prior exposure.\r\nIndividuals on the autism spectrum have unusually strong sensory preferences  ([6]). Indeed we have found that not only individuals with diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but also those with   higher   levels   of   autistic   personality   traits   demonstrate marked differences in their responses to environmental sensory stimulation  than those with few such traits. These difficulties  can make some types of sensory stimulation intolerable. Whilst the list of  stressors  includes  obvious  things  like  flickering  lights,  fire alarms and chemical smells, these can also be such apparently innocuous   things   as  brightly   coloured   objects,   brushing   past somebody in a supermarket and the smells of everyday foods.\r\nThis survey of research  might suggest that the idea of predicting perceptual  responses is a hopeless task, complicated  as it appears to be by the presence of these large individual differences. I would like to argue that a combination of careful characterisation  of participant groups, using demographic data and personality questionnaires,  and  careful  attention  to the words  people  use to describe  their  sensory  experiences,  at least  in the first  instance, will  lead  to  a greater  ability  to move  forward  in  this  field  and thereby establish at least what the “average human” response will be in representative situations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Simmons, David R."],"dc:date":"2012-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Our findings can be further used to judge how vigorously the porridge is boiled and accordingly adjust the cooking power in automatic cooking systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sun, Yujuan","Dong, Junyu","Qi, Lin","Chantler, Mike"],"dc:date":"2012-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934481,"sim:weight":0.316205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934124,"sim:weight":0.286127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147453,"sim:weight":0.284881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.267845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56544,"sim:weight":0.248309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227340,"sim:weight":0.248256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934910,"sim:weight":0.247932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933744,"sim:weight":0.235192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98644,"sim:weight":0.227134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In such systems, interacting low level elements can engender a difficult to predict emergence  of macro-level characteristics. Furthermore, the state space  of some  systems can  be  vast.    Consequently,  designers   generally   rely on  trial-and-error,  experience   or  intuition in  selecting parameter values  to develop  the aesthetic aspects  of their de- signs.  We investigate an alternative means  of exploring  the state spaces  of generative visual  systems  by  using  a  gaze- contingent display.   A user’s gaze continuously controls and directs  an evolution of visual  forms and  patterns on screen. As time progresses  and  the viewer  and  system  remain  coupled  in this  evolution, a population of generative artefacts tends towards an area of their state space that is ‘of interest’, as defined by the eye tracking data. The evaluation-feedback loop is continuous and uninterrupted, gaze the guiding  feedback  mechanism in the  exploration of state space.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ekeus, Henrik","Plumbley, Mark D.","McOwan, Peter W."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Participants reported perceived colour (isoluminant Red/Green) and disappearance of the target dot superimposed on a distracter mask (drifting sine- wave grating or rotating array of blue crosses) by pressing and releasing corresponding keys. Our results suggest that MIB and BR were both affected by motion, but not by rivalry in the mask. Normalized disappearance was significantly increased for smaller targets, as well as monoptically presented targets but differently for  the  two  types  of  masks.  On  the  other  hand  contrast  of dichoptic target dots in the left and right eye had a significant effect on duration, as well as number of appearances of the Red/Green target, but not on target disappearance.

Mycoplasmas were cultured from 54 saliva samples and from 57 plaque samples. Isolation frequency and numbers of mycoplasmas in relation to total anaerobic counts were consistently related to gingivitis scores in both plaque and saliva samples, with higher frequencies and proportions with increasing levels of gingival inflammation at the selected site.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Sixty cleft lip and palate patients (12 to 17 years of age) from Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia and their parents were selected. The questionnaires used were the Child Interview Schedule, the Parents Interview Schedule, and the Cleft Evaluation Profile (CEP), administered via individual interviews. RESULTS: Patients were teased because of their clefts and felt their self-confidence was affected by the cleft condition. They were frequently teased about cleft-related features such as speech, teeth, and lip appearance. Parents also reported that their children were being teased because of their clefts and that their children\u0027s self-confidence was affected by the clefts. Both showed a significant level of satisfaction with the treatment provided by the cleft team. There was no significant difference between the responses of the patients and their parents. The features that were found to be most important for the patients and their parents, in decreasing order of priority, were teeth, nose, lips, and speech. CONCLUSIONS: Cleft lip and/or palate patients were teased because of their clefts, and it affected their self-confidence. The Cleft Evaluation Profile is a reliable and useful tool to assess patients\u0027 level of satisfaction with treatment received for cleft lip and/or palate and can identify the types of cleft-related features that are most important for the patients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Noor, S.

This method of producing software suitable for customers has been adapted to help in the production of e-learning material, in particular, Assessment Learning Objects (ALOs) consisting of multiple-choice questions. Asking undergraduate students to produce multiple-choice questions as part of their formal assessment processes facilitated this. The outcome shows two distinct benefits to this process. Firstly, the students who took part in this project benefited from the encouragement to participate in reflective learning, both on the specific topic on which they chose to produce a multiple choice question, and in the methods and purposes of multiple choice questions (which form a significant part of their self-assessment regime and summative assessment exam). Secondly, of the questions produced by students a significant number of them were of suitable quality to be used for future cohorts and to be made available to the wider community. This gives two important benefits to staff: developing a wide range of questions is difficult and time consuming; student insight into misunderstandings of material can often be greater than that of staff. Resources for the development of ALOs are scarce and given that students benefit directly from being asked to develop their own questions, the year-on-year expansion of a question set produced by students can be a very useful resource.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, A.A.","Williams, S.A."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.537278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160793,"sim:weight":0.53172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.52995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.503214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.480523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.431243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.415533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.411642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A survey quantifying the adoption of UGC by mainstream news organisations showed a dramatic increase in the opportunities for contributions from readers. In-depth interviews with senior news executives revealed this expansion is taking place despite residual doubts about the editorial and commercial value of material from the public. The study identified a shift towards the use of moderation due to editors\u0027 persistent concerns about reputation, trust, and legal liabilities, indicating that UK newspaper websites are adopting a traditional gate-keeping role towards UGC. The findings suggest a gate-keeping approach may offer a model for the integration of UGC, with professional news organisations providing editorial structures to bring different voices into their news reporting, filtering and aggregating UGC in ways they believe to be useful and valuable to their audience. While this research looked at UGC initiatives in the context of the UK newspaper industry, it has broad relevance as professional journalists tend to share a similar set of norms. The British experience offers valuable lessons for news executives making their first forays into this area and for academics studying the field of participatory journalism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hermida, Alfred","Thurman , Neil J"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In order to understand these behaviors, there is a need to look into the chromosomal alterations and gene pathways that maybe associated with oral cancer at these sites. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the differences in chromosomal aberrations and gene pathways involved in tongue and cheek cancer using high resolution array CGH. Methods: A genome wide screening with array CGH (SurePrint G3 CGH 1x1M microarray) was performed using gDNA from 20 snap frozen fresh tissues consisting of 12 tongue and 8 cheek oral squamous cell carcinomas (samples from the Malaysian Oral Cancer Data and Tumour Bank System [MOCDTBS] coordinated by OCRCC-UM). Cytosure Software was used to detect the chromosomal aberrations and candidate genes related to the selected regions. Pathway analysis was done using MetaCore™software for selected genes.Results: The mean number of chromosomal aberrations per tumour for tongue cancer (22 ± 24.97) was higher than cheek cancer (8.38 ± 11.98). The most common amplified regions in tongue cancers were 8q24.22 (33.33%), 8q24.3 (33.33%), 11q13.1 (33.33%), 11q13.2 (33.33%), 12q13.13 (33.33%), 14q32.33 (33.33%) and for cheek cancer the most common amplified region was 22q12.3 (25%). For the deleted regions, the most common for tongue cancer were 2q21.1 (16.67%), 6q21 (16.67%) and for cheek cancer were 2q22.1 (25%), 7q35 (25%), 19q13.33 (25%). The most significant pathway based on p \u003c 0.001 involved in tongue cancer is cell adhesion ECM remodeling pathway Among the genes involved in amplified region, were EGFR, MMP1, MMP10, MMP12, MMP3, MMP7 and MMP9. For cheek cancer, the cancer associated significant pathway was apoptosis and survival (the role of CDK5 in neuronal death and survival). An oncogene located at 8p12 was identified in this pathway is NRG1.Discussion: This study showed a different pattern of chromosomal aberrations in tongue and cheek cancer with different significant gene pathways. Tongue cancer behaves more aggressively than cheek cancer which may be due to the involvement of ECM remodeling pathway, where MMP family which are the proteolytic enzyme that degrade various component in the extracellular matrix would favor invasion and metastasis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chong, V.

The objectives of this study are to detect hTERT protein expression using immunohistochemistry in different histological stages in oral carcinogenesis with paraffin embedded tissue samples and cultured cells and to relate the hTERT expression with different histological stages in oral carcinogenesis. Materials and Methods: A total of 41 parafin-embedded tissue samples with histological diagnoses of normal oral mucosa (n\u003d5), epithelial hyperplasia (n\u003d5), mild epithelial dysplasia (n\u003d9), moderate and severe epithelial dysplasia (n\u003d8) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC, n\u003d14) were analysed for hTERT protein using IHC. TRAP assays were performed on cultured cells namely fibroblasts (immortalized with hTERT) and keratinocytes (OSC-20, OSCC cell line, H S R R B, Japan) as positive controls.

The presence of a variety of MDM2 splice variants have been reported in many different types of tumor and some have been shown to be associated with patient prognosis.Materials and methods: In this study, we demonstrated the occurrence of MDM2 splice variants in OSCC tissues. RNA was extracted from 45 OSCC tissues and 17 normal oral mucosa tissues and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Nested PCR was performed to amplify the MDM2 transcripts and the PCR amplicons were cloned into cloning vector pTZ57R/T and sequenced.Results: We demonstrated that 37/45 OSCC and 14/17 normal oral mucosa tissues contained MDM2 splice variants and a total of 34 transcript variants were found. Comparing with the reported splice variants in GenBank, four known variants, MDM2B, MDM2C, MDM2-EU2 and MDM2-PM2 were found in tumor samples with MDM2B being the most common variants found in our samples. None of these known variants were found in normal oral mucosa tissues. The other 30 transcript variants were novel, where 3 of these were present in both tumor and normal tissues, 23 were found only in tumor tissues and 4 were exclusive to normal oral mucosa tissue.Discussion: The common loss among the variants was sequences coding for the p53 binding domain, acidic domain, nuclear localization and nuclear export domains. In general, all 30 novel transcript variants were aberrantly spliced, however, interestingly, 9/23 aberrantly spliced variants in OSCC codes for an in-frame putative protein, suggesting that despite the aberrant splicing, these transcripts may still result in a functional protein and therefore further work to study how these splice variants affect MDM2 function directly or how they may affect other binding partners is needed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sam, K.

However, the role of miRNAs in OSCC progression has yet to be well-studied. Here, we demonstrated the use of FFPE specimens in microarray profiling and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) approaches to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed in OSCC compared with non-tumour tissues.Materials and methods: Four OSCC and four non-tumour FFPE tissues were obtained from the Malaysian Oral Cancer Database and Tumour System (MOCDTBS), coordinated by OCRCC-UM and profiled using Agilent 8 Ã? 15 k mammalian miRNA microarray. Based on microarray results, TaqMan miRNA Assay (qPCR) is underway to validate the selected differentially expressed miR-31, miR-7, miR-375 and miR-151-3p with an endogeneous control RNU-44 using an independent set of FFPE tissue (seven OSCC and three non-tumuor tissues). Biological functions of targeted miRNAs were analyzed using GeneGO Pathway software.Results: Analysis of profiling identified 19 significantly up-regulated miRNAs (2-fold change) and four significantly down-regulated miRNAs (2-fold change). The targeted miR-31, miR-7 and miR-151-3p were up-regulated whilst miR-375 was down-regulated in OSCC compared with non-tumour tissues. These initial microarray profiling results had been subsequently confirmed in qPCR validation except miR-151-3p, which was validated as down-regulated miRNA.Discussion: Interestingly, we have identified miRNA targets that can potentially be exploited to differentiate between betel-quid exposure OSCC with no risk habit related OSCC. These miRNA targets were found to interact with protein BuBRl in regulation of cellular component organization (p0.05, GeneGo Pathway software). BuBR1 can be modified by arecoline in betel nut leads to abnormal cell cycle progression. Further analyses with larger sample set are on-going to validate the preliminary result and examine if the betel-quid exposures related with OSCC carcinogenesis may be acting through a specific miRNA alterations to lead to a malignant phenotypes. This better understanding of the contribution of miRNA to OSCC may aid in earlier diagnosis, improved prognosis, and novel targets for therapeutic intervention.","bibo:AuthorList":["Siow, M.

An immune mediated pathogenesis is recognized in lichen planus although the exact etiology is unknown. The disease most commonly affects middle-aged females. Oral lichenoid reactions (OLR) which are considered variants of OLP, may be regarded as a disease by itself or as an exacerbation of an existing OLP, by the presence of medication (lichenoid drug reactions) or dental materials (contact hypersensitivity). OLP usually presents as white striations (Wickham\u0027s striae), white papules, white plaque, erythema, erosions or blisters. Diagnosis of OLP is established either by clinical examination only or by clinical examination with histopathologic confirmation. Direct immunofluorescence examination is only used as an adjunct to the above method of diagnosis and to rule out specific autoimmune diseases such as pemphigus and pemphigoid. Histopathologic features of OLP and OLR are similar with suggestions of certain discriminatory features by some authors. Topical corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for OLP although several other medications have been studied including retinoids, tacrolimus, cyclosporine and photodynamic therapy. Certain OLP undergo malignant transformation and the exact incidence and mechanisms are still controversial. In this paper, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, management and malignant transformation of OLP and OLR have been reviewed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ismail, S. B.","Kumar, S. K. S.","Zain, R.

The results showed differing nuclear staining patterns for PCNA in normal, hyperplastic and dysplastic epithelium, early cancer and 3 levels of differentiation for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. It appears that PCNA can be a useful marker in delineating normal epithelium and hyperplastic epithelium from dysplasia in the oral cavity. The use of PCNA staining may further emphasize the conventional histopathological grading of well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated and poorly-differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma but is still dependent on basic criteria as observed without immunostaining.

Materials and Methods: The sample of this study consisted of 31 biopsy cases of OSCC from the buccal mucosa. Immunohistochemistry was used with specific antibodies to K1-67, MDM2 and Bcl-2. Evaluation of the nuclear immunoreactivity of all K1-67, MDM2 and Bcl-2 was done at the tumour invasive front (3-6 cell layers at the tumour advancing front). Results: The expression of K1-67, MDM2 and Bcl-2 were detected in 90.3% (28), 64.5% (20) and 16.1% (5) of the cases respectively. The distribution of K1-67 and Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was observed to be quite similar where immunoreactivity was mainly at peripheral invading margin of tumour cell islands with decreasing immunoreactivity towards the centre. The distribution of MDM2 immunoreactivity was unlike that K1-67 and Bcl-2 where the immunoreactivity was observed mainly at the suprabasal region. The present study found significant association between MDM2 expression with gender and Broder’s tumour grading. Significant association was also observed between combined K1-67/MDM2 expression with both gender and Broder’s tumour grading. Conclusion: The present study appeared to suggest no significant association between K1-67, MDM2 and Bcl-2 at the tumour invasive front. No association was also found between k1-67 expression as a proliferative marker and both MDM2 and Bcl-2 as apoptotic markers. However, it appeared to support the observation from the previous study that an increase carcinoma proliferation rate would also be accompanied by an increase in apoptosis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ngeow, W.

Gene expression microarrays have been used successfully in the identification of genetic alterations in cancer development, however, these have hitherto been limited by the need for specimens with good quality intact RNA. Here, we demonstrated the use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues in microarray experiments to identify genes differentially expressed between cancerous and normal oral tissues. Forty-three tissue samples were macrodissected and gene expression analyses were conducted using the Illumina DASL assay. We report RNA yield of 2.4 and 0.8 μg/mm3 from tumour and normal tissues, respectively and this correlated directly with the tissue volume used for RNA extraction. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, distinct gene expression profiles for tumour and normal samples could be generated, and differentially expressed genes could be identified. The majority of these genes were involved in regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle, metastasis and cell adhesion including BCL2A1, BIRC5, MMP1, MMP9 and ITGB4. Representative genes were further validated in independent samples suggesting that these genes may be directly associated with oral cancer development. The ability to conduct microarrays on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens represents a significant advancement that could open up avenues for finding genes that could be used as prognostication and predictive tools for cancer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saleh, A.","Zain, R.

In this investigation, we explored the potential of DPSCs to differentiate into pancreatic cell lineage resembling islet-like cell aggregates (ICAs). We isolated, propagated, and characterized DPSCs and demonstrated that these could be differentiated into adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineage upon exposure to an appropriate cocktail of differentiating agents. Using a three-step protocol reported previously by our group, we succeeded in obtaining ICAs from DPSCs. The identity of ICAs was confirmed as islets by dithiozone-positive staining, as well as by expression of C-peptide, Pdx-1, Pax4, Pax6, Ngn3, and Isl-1. There were several-fold up-regulations of these transcription factors proportional to days of differentiation as compared with undifferentiated DPSCs. Day 10 ICAs released insulin and C-peptide in a glucose-dependent manner, exhibiting in vitro functionality. Our results demonstrated for the first time that DPSCs could be differentiated into pancreatic cell lineage and offer an unconventional and non-controversial source of human tissue that could be used for autologous stem cell therapy in diabetes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Govindasamy, V.","Ronald, V.S.","Abdullah, A.N.","Nathan, K.R.G.","Aziz, Zaca","Abdullah, M.","Musa, S.","Abu Kasim, N.H."],"dc:date":"2011-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":332880,"sim:weight":0.672753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5723600,"sim:weight":0.524225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1054655,"sim:weight":0.495031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5856796,"sim:weight":0.479723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9612360,"sim:weight":0.400203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585669,"sim:weight":0.344123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5849547,"sim:weight":0.337337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5849128,"sim:weight":0.335293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999231,"sim:weight":0.333085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.254715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98849,"sim:weight":0.219022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844458,"sim:weight":0.209244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.194337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The method involves constraining a rolling ruby ball between the \u0027\u0027v\u0027\u0027 groove of a rotor and the test specimen. The ball applies a compressive stress to the surface of the test material whilst it rolls in a circular pattern across the specimen surface. The fatigue life is defined as the time taken for surface degradation to begin to occur. The method is simple and reproducible and allows fatigue data to be gathered using a relatively small number of specimens. A series of model dental composites having varying filler fractions (23.7-66.4 vol%) were used to assess the potential of the method. The pattern of material loss as well as scanning electron microscopy examination of the damaged surfaces of test specimens confirmed that a fatigue mechanism was responsible for material loss. The fatigue life varied markedly with filler volume fraction being optimized at values in the range 30-50 vol%. Lower and higher volume fractions reduced the fatigue life. Filler silanation significantly improves fatigue life. The results suggest that the rolling ball device will prove useful in comparing the properties of different materials and in the development of improved products.","bibo:AuthorList":["McCabe, J.

The specimens were divided into 11 groups of 10 each. Test groups 1-6 were subjected to 0, 250, 500, 750, 1000 and 10,000 thermal cycles respectively. All specimens were subjected to a 3 point bend test and loaded at a crosshead speed of 1mm/min-1 on an Instron Testing Machine. The fracture toughess of all materials decreases with the number of thermal cycles and length of water storage except for CC where the fracture toughness increases during the earlier stages of thermocycling and water storage. However the lowest fracture toughness values were for groups 6 and 11. One way analysis of variance showed that Group 1 was significantly different from groups 6 and 11 (P\u003c.05), the thermally cyled and the water storage groups were not different from each other for al materials. The decrease in fracture toughness exhibited by all light activated composites could be explained by interfacial stress formation and resin-filler debonding while the increase in fracture toughness during the earlier stages of thermocycling and water storage of chemically-activated composite be explained by continued polymerisation.

Twenty Malay children with repaired UCLP (12 boys, 8 girls; Mean age: 10.5 years) and 20 normal Malay children (8 boys, 12 girls; Mean age: 9.72 years) were recruited from the Combined Cleft Lip and Palate Clinic and the Department of Children\u0027s Dentistry and Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Malaysia. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken with the head orientated parallel to the floor. Thirty-one linear and angular variables were measured on the lateral cephalometric radiographs with Dolphin Imaging Software Version 10.0 (Dolphin Imaging, Chatsworth, CA, USA). The data were analysed with the Mann-Whitney U test and the level of significance was set at p \u003c 0.05. In the UCLP group, the girls had deeper overbites than the boys (p \u003d 0.011), and in the Control group the girls had a significantly more acute cranial base angle (NSBa, p \u003d 0.017) and a less protrusive lower lip (LL-E line, p \u003d 0.21). The data for the boys and girls were combined. Subjects in the UCLP group had a more acute cranial base angle, shorter and more retruded maxillae and were more skeletal III than the subjects in the Control group. In the UCLP group, the upper and lower incisors were less proclined than in the Control group, the interincisal angle was more obtuse and the overjet reduced by 6 mm. There were no significant facial height differences. The nasolabial angle (Col-Sn-UL) was significantly more obtuse and the upper lip relative to the E line more retrusive in the UCLP group. There was no significant difference between the groups in facial heights or the maxillo-mandibular planes angle. Malay children with repaired UCLP have small, retrusive maxillae. The mandible in this group of children was of normal size and position, relative to the cranial base. Pressure from the repaired upper lip may be responsible for the retruded maxillae, retroclined incisors and obtuse nasolabial angle.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ebin, L. E.","Zam, N. M.","Othman, S.

The other objectives were to identify the components of MI which are correlated with the reading test scores, and to determine the relationship between the multiple intelligences and reading proficiency. A descriptive and ex post facto design was employed to ascertain relationships among the variables. The participants were 128 randomly chosen pre-university students (grade12, 18-19 years old) of both genders studying in Tehran in the academic year 2008-2009. Three instruments were utilized in this study: 1) a demographic questionnaire; 2) the Persian version of Mckenzie’s MI Inventory; and 3) a standardized reading proficiency test which was selected from retrieved paper-based TOEFL® tests. Results of the correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between the two variables of MI and reading scores of the students. Furthermore, the results of the correlation analysis revealed that there was a low significant, negative relationship between musical-rhythmic intelligence and reading which suggests that when the reading score of a student increases, musical-rhythmic intelligence of the same student decreases and vice versa. Overall, three categories of MI (musical-rhythmic, verbal-linguistic, bodily-kinesthetic) were found to be predictive of reading proficiency.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hajhashemi, Karim","Wong, Bee Eng"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The in vitro investigation of the implant-soft tissue interface is usually carried out using a monolayer cell-culture model that lacks a polarized-cell phenotype. This study developed a tissue-engineered threedimensional oral mucosal model (3D OMM) to investigate the implant-soft tissue interface. Methods: A 3D OMM was constructed using primary human oral keratinocytes and fibroblasts cultured on a skin-derived scaffold at an air-liquid interface. A titanium implant was inserted into the engineered oral mucosa and further cultured to establish epithelial attachment. The 3D OMM was characterized using basic histology and immunostaining for cytokeratin (CK) 10 and CK13. Histomorphometric analyses of the implant-soft tissue interface were carried out using a light-microscopy (LM) examination of ground sections and semi-thin sections as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: Immunohistochemistry analyses suggests that the engineered oral mucosa closely resembles the normal oral mucosa. The LM and SEM examinations reveal that the 3D OMM forms an epithelial attachment on the titanium surface. Conclusion: The 3D OMM provided mimicking peri-implant features as seen in an in vivo model and has the potential to be used as a relevant alternative model to assess implant-soft tissue interactions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chai, W.

More attention is needed to address and treat smokers presenting to hospitals with acute and chronic medical illness as hospitals provide good settings to implement smoking cessation intervention. For instance, a tobacco related medical illness may boosts a smoker\u0027s motivation to stop, especially when the smoker perceives smoking as the cause of his illness and understands the gains achieved by smoking cessation. Besides bringing a smoker in contact with health personnel who may offer assistance to a smoker to help him stop smoking, a hospital stay also provide an opportunity for the health carer to initiate and practice the government policy of no smoking in the hospitals.

The emphasis was directed at the initial stage of dental plaque formation, specifically the adherence of bacteria referred to as the early plaque colonisers, to the acquired pellicle on the supragingival tooth surface. Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis and Actinomyces sp., the predominant bacteria involved at this initial stage of plaque development were used as test organisms. The aqueous extracts of Piper betle and Psidium guajava exhibited antimicrobial activities with MIC values in the range of 2.61 to 4.69 mg/mL and toxicity values (LC(50) and EC(50)) well above their toxic concentrations. P. betle and P. guajava extracts contained 9.25 and 11.5 ppm fluoride, respectively. Some aggregating activity was also displayed by the extract of the latter. Both extracts showed positive antiadherence activity and reduced the cell-surface hydrophobicity of the bacteria which might have rendered them less adherent and hence, minimising their adhesion to the tooth surface during the early stage of plaque development. Both extracts also suppressed the growth of these bacteria. Such an activity was reaffirmed and supported by SEM micrographs whereby the bacterial cells were unable to divide or grow successfully and hence suggesting bacteriostatic effect of the extracts.

The aim of the study was to elucidate if such anti-plaque activities involve any ultra-structural changes to the morphology of three early dental plaque bacteria, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis and Actinomyces sp. Methodology: Pure cultures of the bacteria were suspended in BHI medium and treated with the test herbal extracts at the sub-lethal concentrations. The growth mixtures were incubated at 37 degrees C. At the logarithmic growth phase (t(1)), aliquots of 1 ml of the growth mixtures were fixed and used in the preparation of specimens for SEM studies. Ultra-structural alterations to the morphology of the treated cells noted were compared to those of the cells cultured under untreated conditions. Results: Following exposure of the bacteria to the two test herbal extracts, profound ultra-structural changes to their morphology were observed. The observed structural or morphological alterations could attribute to the bacteria being less active in performing normal physiological metabolic functions and thus rendering them less efficient to multiply. The changes noted included (i) reduced sizes of the bacteria, and (ii) majority cells at the non-dividing state as compared to those cultured under controlled conditions.

SP wascollected from the two most posterior teeth in the contra-lateral quadrants before and after a 30-second rinse with either distilled water (control group) or 0.1 ppm ozonated water (test group). The plaque was used to count the number of total bacteria, total anaerobic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, and Candida albicans on selective agar media. The statistical analysis of the number of colony forming units (CFUs) obtained demonstrated a significant antimicrobial effect of ozonated water on the total bacteria (p \u003d 0.01) and anaerobes (p \u003d 0.02). A reduction in the post-rinse CFU count for Streptococcus mutans was also observed, but the effect was not statistically significant (p \u003d 0.07).

To induce switched generations C. krusei was cultured under nitrogen-depleted growth conditions by adding phloxine B. These phenotypically switched colonies were designated as the 1st generation. Subsequent sub-culturing was performed to produce the 2nd, 3rd and 4th switched generations. The recovery of the 3rd generation was the highest at 85.7 while that of the 4th generation was lower at 70.8, and the recovery of the 1st and 2nd generations gradually reduced to 46.6 and 36.4, respectively.

The aim of this survey was to evaluate how satisfied customers were with their bank and to offer non-binding advice. This resulted in almost 2500 questionnaires which were used to analyse the possibilities and limits of new customer acquisition. Data collection must fulfil strict statistical requirements to be considered for the analysis used. One fundamental requirement for statistical inference is representativity (i.e. the non-biased random selection of a sample). This ideal situation is, however, in reality extremely rare. Here, comparisons with both internal and external data as well as weighting should be considered. These comparisons have been used insufficiently in the past. This thesis focuses on interviewer-specific biases. The sample size used is large enough to extend the conclusions to other surveys. The analysis concentrates on the stability of the sizes of certain variables. This could be regarded as a kind of sensibility analysis. Survey data ordered by interviewer ? are compared with external data using various weighting processes. By doing this, it is possible to achieve a certain trust in the data. This trust is the basis for a further analysis. The thesis is consistent in showing how interviewer bias and manipulations can be detected using different comparisons. When the results of all interviewers are considered together, these detected biases balance each other out to a large extent. This work delivers important guidelines for the analysis of data from small sample sizes. This is especially relevant for internet-based surveys and telephone surveys. The variables \"investor type\", \"profession\", \"age\" and \"sex\" were the variables which were most decisive in forming a customer\u0027s level of trust in his/her bank. People with a higher level of trust in their bank were more likely to agree to the telephone survey and make an appointment to see a consultant. A comparison of the appointments which lead to contracts (health insurance, extra services etc.) shows that the telephone could play an important role as a marketing instrument especially amongst the younger, perhaps less risk-averse people.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schuetze, Joerg","Schuetze, Joerg"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4156428,"sim:weight":0.290122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108236,"sim:weight":0.277879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1344940,"sim:weight":0.260814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.258835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98718,"sim:weight":0.254668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585490,"sim:weight":0.247013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85837,"sim:weight":0.246407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.244725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56605,"sim:weight":0.238655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58828,"sim:weight":0.223127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58835,"sim:weight":0.211201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930833,"sim:weight":0.209745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85823,"sim:weight":0.208094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85709,"sim:weight":0.189899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108989,"sim:weight":0.186451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both have developed resistance to commonly prescribed azole antifungal agents. Objective: The study aimed to determine the effect of mouth rinses containing chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and their combination (CHX-CPC) on the growth of these strains. Methods: The minimal inhibition concentrations (MIC) of the mouth rinses were determined. The growth curves of the strains produced under the mouth rinse-treated and untreated conditions, as well as alterations to the morphology of the growth colonies and cells following the treatments were compared and analysed. Results: The MICs of CPC compared to CHX mouth rinses were found to be lower for both Candida sp. In the mixed formulation, CPC doubled the inhibitory effect of CHX towards both Candida sp., while CHX quadrupled the activity of CPC towards C. tropicalis. The growth colonies also appeared coarse, wrinkled and dried. Conclusion: The profound effects shown may suggest the fungicidal activities of the mouth rinses incorporated with CHX, CPC or their combination on both C. tropicalis and C. krusei. Gargling using mouth rinses with such fungicidal activity would enhance a rapid reduction in the candidal population of patients with fungal infection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fathilah, A.

The study was carried out by enumerating the total colony counts of bristles-adhered microbes after three weeks of normal oral hygiene followed by rinsing the toothbrushes with CHX, HX, tap water and deionized water independently following a strict planned schedule. Rinsing toothbrush with tap water was included in the study as a control due to the normal way of cleaning toothbrush after use in every home. Whereas, sterilized deionized water do not contain any ions, minerals and is microbes-free. The total colony counts of microbes obtained from the toothbrush rinsed with tap water, deionized water, CHX and HX were 62.6×106 CFU mL-1, 74.4×106 CFU mL-1, 2.4×106 CFU mL-1 and 7.6×106 CFU mL-1, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Clostridium sp. were isolated from toothbrush rinsed with tap water. Staphylococcus aureus and Peptostreptococcus sp. were obtained from toothbrush rinsed with deionized water. Actinomyces sp. and Clostridium sp. were recovered from toothbrush rinsed with CHX and only Staphylococcus aureus was obtained from toothbrush rinsed with HX. Although toothbrush rinsed with mouth rinses containing antimicrobial agent such as CHX and HX still harbour microorganisms, but the microbial load has been very much lowered compared to the control toothbrush. Thus, this indicates that toothbrush rinsing with mouth rinse after the normal oral hygiene is very convenient and cost effective to reduce toothbrush contamination.","bibo:AuthorList":["Himratul-Aznita, W.

The increasing clinical and microbiological resistance of Candida species towards several commonly prescribed antifungal agents however, has lead to the search for new active antifungal compounds from natural resources. This study was carried out to screen the susceptibility of the aqueous extract of Piper betle towards seven species of oral Candida. It was found that P. betle extract exhibited high antifungal activities towards Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida dubliniensis, Candida lusitaniae, Candida krusei and Candida parapsilosis. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) value of P. betle extract towards all Candida species was found to be similar (12 mg/ml) except towards C. albicans which has been shown to have MIC value of 12 mg/ml and slightly higher MFC value of 25 mg/ml. The recorded data on the growth responses of the species to various concentrations of the extract following a 24 h incubation period were analysed, using the percentage inhibition of diameter growth (PIDG) against chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX). The determination of PIDG values for C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. lusitaniae, C. dubliniensis and C. glabrata has shown that the aqueous extract of P. betle outstrips the positive control used, that was 0.12 w/v chlorhexidine with PIDG values of more than 50 at P. betle concentration of 25 mg/ml. In contrast, PIDG for C. krusei and C. parapsilosis shows that at 25 mg/ml concentration of P. betle extract has little influence on growth inhibition compared to CHX. Thus, the results obtained have shown the potential use of P. betle extract as antifungal agent and thus significantly contribute to its antifungal development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Himratul-Aznita, W.

However, the mail mode of administration resulted in higher scores than interview. Cronbach\u0027s alpha was 0.89 and the ICC was also 0.89. All hypotheses developed to assess validity were confirmed. Conclusion: The S-OHIP(M) was found to be valid and reliable and appropriate for use in the cross-sectional studies in Malaysian adult populations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saub, R.","Locker, D.","Allison, P."],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5731381,"sim:weight":0.384878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8794396,"sim:weight":0.376954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394623,"sim:weight":0.269905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5880,"sim:weight":0.23462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.210649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.201991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91560,"sim:weight":0.173958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69210,"sim:weight":0.168451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.164313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.155196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Data was obtained from a \"Key informant interview\" method i.e. the village Tok Halaq (Traditional healer). Information about common oral diseases and conditions were illustrated with enlarged pictures of dental caries, periodontal disease, oral cancer and cleft. The most common oral problem was toothache. This is treated by self-medication. However if the pain still persist, the Tok Halaq was consulted to start traditional methods. He will identify the cause. If \"germs\" were thought to be the cause, he will ask the person to see a doctor. Otherwise, he attempts traditional treatment. If the effort failed after a few days, the person will be advised to see a doctor. It appears that the Tok Halaq plays an influential role in prevention, promotion and the healing process in this community. Hence any effort to promote oral health and prevent oral disease must seek their cooperation.

The purpose of this study was to determine the oral health status and treatment needs of elderly hostel residents in Melbourne. Method: One hundred and seventy-five subjects aged 65+ were selected from 20 hostels within a 10km radius of Melbourne\u0027s central business district. Results: Subjects were clinically examined and interviewed using a standard questionnaire. In the course of the clinical examination, coronal caries, root caries, periodontal disease, denture status and related treatment needs were assessed. The mean age of the subjects was 83.7, the majority of whom were female (80 per cent). About 35 per cent of the sample were dentate. The mean number of teeth present among dentate persons was 13.8, the mean coronal caries experience was 24.9 DMFT and mean root caries was 2.3 R-DF Of the dentate subjects, 46 per cent required at least one restoration for coronal caries and 30 per cent required at least one restoration for root caries. Most dentate subjects had calculus and none had deep pockets, therefore, indications for periodontal treatment did not include complex care. More than 50 per cent of lower full dentures were retained unsatisfactorily and about half of the total number of subjects required prosthetic treatment. Conclusions: Although there was a high number of treatment needs, most requirements involved simple technologies that could be delivered by auxiliaries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saub, R.","Evans, R.

Methods: The Child-OIDP index was translated from English into Malay. The Malay version was tested for reliability and validity on a non-random sample of 132, 11-12 year old schoolchildren from two urban schools in Kuala Lumpur. Psychometric analysis of the Malay Child-OIDP involved face, content, criterion and construct validity tests as well as internal and test-retest reliability. Non-parametric statistical methods were used to assess relationships between Child-OIDP scores and other subjective outcome measures. Results: The standardised Cronbach\u0027s alpha was 0.80 and the weighted Kappa was 0.84 (intraclass correlation \u003d 0.79). The index showed significant associations with different subjective measures viz. perceived satisfaction with mouth, perceived needs for dental treatment, perceived oral health status and toothache experience in the previous 3 months (p\u003c0.05). Two-thirds (66.7) of the sample had oral impacts affecting one or more performances in the past 3 months. The three most frequently affected performances were cleaning teeth (36.4), eating foods (34.8) and maintaining emotional stability (26.5). In terms of severity of impact, the ability to relax was most severely affected by their oral conditions, followed by ability to socialise and doing schoolwork. Almost three-quarters (74.2) of schoolchildren with oral impacts had up to three performances affected by their oral conditions. Conclusion: This study indicated that the Malay Child-OIDP index is a valid and reliable instrument to measure the oral impacts of daily performances in 11-12 year old urban schoolchildren in Malaysia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yusof, Z.Y.M.","Jaafar, N."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5731381,"sim:weight":0.342327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.15822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108312,"sim:weight":0.156214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.14336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.138529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98656,"sim:weight":0.137289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
