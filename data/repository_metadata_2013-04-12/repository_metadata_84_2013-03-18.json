The reasons why this is so are usually attributed to structural issues. However, we argue that these variations have historical and cultural roots that may originate long ago and have become institutionalized through time. We report on desk research we carried out into an emerging renaissance relating to the Danish Enterprise Culture and cultural attitudes towards entrepreneurship in Denmark. This has been brought about by a new appreciation of the Danish-American Dream and has opened up a new discourse challenging the embeddedness of previously held negative attitudes towards entrepreneurs.\nMETHOD: We used a historical lens to examine the phenomenon of migration from the ‘State of Denmark’ and concentrated on historical epochs which perhaps influenced why Danes traditionally held entrepreneurs in poor regard. In particular we focused on the socio-cultural factor of religion. The research method thus necessitated the use of a narrative based and social constructionist framework.\nANALYSIS: The Danish aversion to boasting and to celebrating entrepreneurial attitudes and achievement was traced back to their humble roots as a nation of peasant farmers and to a fusion of religious beliefs which led to the formation of the Jantelaw.\nRESULTS: This paper explores the socio-cultural and historical factors influencing the perceived low level of entrepreneurial drive of Danes at home and abroad documenting how they are changing.\nCONCLUSION: This paper addresses the important issue of how history and culture influences the eagerness and earnestness of the entrepreneurial activity of a people and in turn shapes the entrepreneurial libido of a nation. Furthermore it demonstrates how a nation can rescript tired old narratives of enterprise which no longer accommodate their entrepreneurial spirit and enterprise cultures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert","Neergaard, Helle"],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108656,"sim:weight":0.452153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.421779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.416789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.416789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.391657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.376238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929875,"sim:weight":0.374425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112506,"sim:weight":0.358423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.357435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631786,"sim:weight":0.354315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.353624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.352126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90566,"sim:weight":0.34909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382030,"sim:weight":0.33991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109476,"sim:weight":0.333084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381966,"sim:weight":0.3314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.327466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46944,"sim:weight":0.324654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.316216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46981,"sim:weight":0.305124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The notion of humble leadership being of relevance to the police service per se was first raised by Leadership Professor Dennis Tourish at the SIPR New Directions in Policing, leadership seminar held at the Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen on 7 May, 2009.\nIn leadership research there is a tendency to concentrate upon the charismatic vein that flows through leadership. However, not all leaders are comfortable with the theatricality and showmanship which often accompany this very public style of leadership. In public services such as the police there is often merit in adopting a cloak of anonymity and being quiet and industrious as one goes about the task of supervising, managing and leading their team. Middle management is a psychic space where one is under pressure to quietly perform and produce results. Thus paradoxically, being the proverbial but dependable ‘Grey Man’ can have potential benefits in terms of career development. This is particularly true of those officers who are in temporary roles and acting ranks. In this respect the metaphors of the steward and the caretaker are of particular relevance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383619,"sim:weight":0.485409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780087,"sim:weight":0.482475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77815,"sim:weight":0.295748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.280902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75399,"sim:weight":0.26295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.259016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.2567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.255933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.241622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631808,"sim:weight":0.233116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.229334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.225771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.218957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.214855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.214855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.210011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.209347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.208893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75273,"sim:weight":0.201985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45075,"sim:weight":0.192517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We first present a novel\nvector representation for protein structures, in which\na protein structural region, formed by the vectors\nwithin the region, is defined as a patch and indexed\nby its patch signature. For a k-sized patch, its patch\nsignature consists of 7k ¡ 10 inter-atom distances\nwhich uniquely determine the patch\u0027s spatial struc-\nture.

This paper\nargues that the literature in the area is replete with unresolved paradoxes.\nThese revolve around how spirituality is defined, with advocates variously\nstressing its religious dimensions, usually from a Christian perspective,\nand others articulating a more secular approach focusing on nondenominational\nhumanistic values. Additionally, much of the literature\nstresses the value of spirituality as an aid to increasing productivity and\nprofits. Thus, spiritual means are attached to performative ends, even as\nits advocates stress its emancipatory intent. In exploring these\ncontradictions, this paper argues that, despite asserting the opposite\nintention, spirituality management approaches seek to abolish the\ndistinction between people’s work based lives on the one hand, and their\npersonal lives and value systems on the other. Influence is conceived in\nuni-directional terms: it flows from ‘spiritual’ managers to more or less\ncompliant staff, deemed to be in need of enlightenment, rather than vice\nversa. It is therefore argued that, despite the emancipatory rhetoric in\nwhich much spirituality discourse is couched, it promotes constricting\ncultural and behavioural norms, and thereby seeks to reinforce managerial\npower at the expense of individual autonomy. The implications for the\nmanagement of culture, and such issues as conformity and dissent, are\nconsidered.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tourish, Dennis","Tourish, Naheed"],"dc:date":"2008-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.556441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.487385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.485197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.45509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.414703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.413373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108987,"sim:weight":0.398354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.396054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.391395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.375081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45163,"sim:weight":0.374795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.371226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.363636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108330,"sim:weight":0.361725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45075,"sim:weight":0.350516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99226,"sim:weight":0.338723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.334741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.332829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.30592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.304182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":14074,"ep:Repository":84,"dc:type":["Report"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Health \u0026 ethnicity in Aberdeenshire : a study of Polish in-migrants ; a report for the Scottish Health Council.","bibo:abstract":"In Scotland as a whole, around 2% of the population are from minority ethnic backgrounds, although the distribution of people from such backgrounds is uneven across the country. In Aberdeenshire, out of a total population of 232,850, 1,165 people come from ethnic minority backgrounds, around 0.5 % of the total population. According to the 2001 Census, there are nine main ethnic minority groups in Aberdeenshire, the largest of which is Chinese, comprising around a quarter of the total ethnic minority population of the area (n\u003d277, 24%). The remaining groups are made up of Indians, Pakistanis, other South Asians, Africans, Black Scottish and people from the Caribbean. However, around 29% come from ‘other minority ethnic groups’. With respect to the latter, there has been a noticeable influx of people from Eastern Europe, particularly Poland, Lithuania and Latvia following the accession of ten new member states to the European Union on the 1st April 2004. It has been estimated that around 800 migrant workers and their families are now coming to Grampian each month (400 of whom are Polish), if levels of applications for National Insurance numbers are indicative in this respect (NHS Grampian, 2005).\nThe health needs of migrants is becoming increasingly recognised. As such, the International Organization for Migration’s most recent World Migration Report (2005) argued that, ‘the social and economic costs of neglecting migration health, also as a public health issue, can be immeasurable’. The experience of migration can lead to increased vulnerability to ill health as well as ill health, which arises after arrival. Poorer migrants are often lowly paid, living in damp conditions, badly nourished and exposed to higher risks in working environments yet under-utilise health services. In addition, the stigma generated from wider perceptions of poor migrant health can contribute to an undermining of the benefits of migration. In short, migration is a public health issue, which seems likely to endure in an emerging age of migration (Castles and Miller 2003). Finally communication is considered fundamentally important to the health of migrants due to ‘language barriers having adverse effects on the accessibility of care, the quality of care received, patient satisfaction and patient health outcomes’ (Bischoff 2003).\nTo help in-migrants settle into Scotland generally and Aberdeenshire in particular the Scottish Executive and a range of national and regional bodies have introduced a range of policies. Within healthcare, NHS Grampian (2005) aims \"to make genuine and lasting improvements in the quality of services provided to the local ethnic communities and to make NHS Grampian the leader, for other Health Boards to follow\". To this end a range of policies are being implemented. These include, interpretation and translation services, training for NHS Grampian staff to better understand the needs of the local ethnic communities, access and service delivery, racial equality within NHS Grampian, appointments procedures, training procedures, actively promoting health within the ethnic communities and meeting the healthcare needs of recently arrived migrant workers and their families and asylum seekers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Love, John G.","Vertigans, Steve","Domaszk, Emilia","Zdeb, Konrad","Love, Ann P.","Sutton, Philip W."],"dc:date":"2007-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.476243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91804,"sim:weight":0.412383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156166,"sim:weight":0.41022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.372652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157599,"sim:weight":0.363871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.335722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154331,"sim:weight":0.33193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222604,"sim:weight":0.327436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156012,"sim:weight":0.318613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96425,"sim:weight":0.312206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2799729,"sim:weight":0.307328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47285,"sim:weight":0.304249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155864,"sim:weight":0.302887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160667,"sim:weight":0.302086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44978,"sim:weight":0.300951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107315,"sim:weight":0.295975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10062,"sim:weight":0.294801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91801,"sim:weight":0.290405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.288961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47261,"sim:weight":0.279902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They are motivated by the idea of discovering and exploiting\nthe interaction between variables in the solution. They estimate a probability distribution from population of solutions, and sample it to generate the next population. Many EDAs use probabilistic graphical modelling techniques for this purpose. In particular, directed\ngraphical models (Bayesian networks) have been widely used in EDA.\n\nThis thesis proposes an undirected graphical model (Markov Random Field (MRF)) approach\nto estimate and sample the distribution in EDAs. The interaction between variables\nin the solution is modelled as an undirected graph and the joint probability of a solution\nis factorised as a Gibbs distribution. The thesis describes a model of fitness function that approximates the energy in the Gibbs distribution, and shows how this model can be fitted to a population of solutions to estimate the parameters of the MRF. The estimated MRF is then sampled to generate the next population. This approach is applied to estimation of distribution in a general framework of an EDA, called Distribution Estimation using\nMarkov Random Fields (DEUM). The thesis then proposes several variants of DEUM using\ndifferent sampling techniques and tests their performance on a range of optimisation\nproblems. The results show that, for most of the tested problems, the DEUM algorithms\nsignificantly outperform other EDAs, both in terms of number of fitness evaluations and\nthe quality of the solutions found by them. There are two main explanations for the success of DEUM algorithms. Firstly, DEUM builds a model of fitness function to approximate the MRF. This contrasts with other EDAs, which build a model of selected solutions. This allows DEUM to use fitness in variation part of the evolution. Secondly, DEUM exploits the temperature coefficient in the Gibbs distribution to regulate the behaviour of the algorithm.\nIn particular, with higher temperature, the distribution is closer to being uniform\nand with lower temperature it concentrates near some global optima. This gives DEUM\nan explicit control over the convergence of the algorithm, resulting in better optimisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shakya, Siddhartha","McCall, John","Brown, Deryck"],"dc:date":"2006-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.274535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.265377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932120,"sim:weight":0.258187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22219,"sim:weight":0.244583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20956,"sim:weight":0.239784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934278,"sim:weight":0.235541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69506,"sim:weight":0.225715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20593,"sim:weight":0.223294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176886,"sim:weight":0.223077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930910,"sim:weight":0.222322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931954,"sim:weight":0.221223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98531,"sim:weight":0.219344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.2125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998962,"sim:weight":0.207116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26621,"sim:weight":0.205956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19444,"sim:weight":0.192609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930875,"sim:weight":0.190715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931638,"sim:weight":0.175387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98526,"sim:weight":0.171612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931264,"sim:weight":0.171334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In parallel with the development of knowledge acquisition tools is the demand for mechanisms to assure their quality, particularly in safety critical applications. Quality assurance is achieved by checking the contents of the KBS at various stages throughout its life cycle. But how does testing for quality assurance aggravate the already well-known knowledge acquisition bottleneck? The partial automation of checking and correcting the knowledge base (KB) is an obvious approach to reducing the bottleneck, but also a more routine treatment of checking will provide improved facilities for quality assurance. In addition to identifying the occurrence offaults, this paper suggests that responding to faults identified by validation is both useful and important. Therefore, refinement should be thought of as a companion to validation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Craw, Susan","Sleeman, D."],"dc:date":"1995-07","doi":"10.1016/0957-4174","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8932650,"sim:weight":0.236616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998220,"sim:weight":0.220301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.21858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108164,"sim:weight":0.202548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.181502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.179506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.177398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.175639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931886,"sim:weight":0.168536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.096522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One approach which has been advocated is the systematic use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. However, ML technology poses difficulties to domain experts and knowledge engineers who are not familiar with it. This paper discusses Consultant-2, a system which makes a first step towards providing system support for a \"pre- and post-processing\" methodology where a cyclic process of experiments with an ML tool, its data, data description language and parameters attempts to optimize learning performance.\n\nConsultant-2 has been developed to support the use of Machine Learning Toolbox (MLT), an integrated architecture of 10 ML tools, and has evolved from a series of earlier systems. Consultant-0 and Consultant-1 had knowledge only about how to choose an ML algorithm based on the nature of the domain data. Consultant-2 is the most sophisticated. It, additionally, has knowledge about how ML experts and domain experts pre-process domain data before a run with the ML algorithm, and how they further manipulate the data and reset parameters after a run of the selected ML algorithm, to achieve a more acceptable result. How these several KBs were acquired and encoded is described. In fact, this knowledge has been acquired by interacting both with the ML algorithm developers and with domain experts who had been using the MLT toolbox on real-world tasks. A major aim of the MLT project was to enable a domain expert to use the toolbox directly; i.e. without necessarily having to involve either a ML specialist or a knowledge engineer. Consultant\u0027s principal goal was to provide specific advice to ease this process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sleeman, D.","Rissakis, M.","Craw, Susan","Graner, N.","Sharma, S."],"dc:date":"1995-07","doi":"10.1006/ijhc.1995.1035","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8933437,"sim:weight":0.330215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1500704,"sim:weight":0.260833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108164,"sim:weight":0.243351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998220,"sim:weight":0.213979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.210835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.201986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61040,"sim:weight":0.19541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.191928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.184565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.181322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.178068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99250,"sim:weight":0.176944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99184,"sim:weight":0.169255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.0997551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two\npredominant off-flavour compounds are geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB). These compounds are produced by several varieties of cyanobacteria and actinomycetes as metabolic products and can be detected by humans at concentrations as low as 0.015 mg L-1. Removal of GSM and MIB from potable waters has proven to be inefficient using standard water treatment such as filtration, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and chlorination. Activated carbon and membrane processes can physically remove GSM and MIB, but do not destroy them, and ozone treatment can be expensive. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysis has recently been demonstrated to rapidly degrade GSM and MIB. When the semiconductor\ncatalyst is illuminated with ultraviolet light simultaneous oxidation and reduction reactions occur. Pollutants are broken down into mineral acids, carbon dioxide and water. This study was conducted to determine if TiO2 photocatalysis, using a pelleted form of TiO2 called Hombikat K01/C, was a suitable method for the treatment of potable water. Additionally an analytical method was developed to rapidily analyse the large number of samples generated.\nTwo reactors, a bench scale batch reactor and pilot scale flow reactor, were developed and used to evaluate the efficacy of Hombikat K01/C TiO2 photocatalysis in degrading GSM. The batch reactor, containing Hombikat K01/C, was used to investigate the effect of numerous experimental variables on the photocatalysis of GSM, including initial substrate concentration, pH, light intensity, aeration rate, the presence of additional reactants, and catalysis\nconducted in deuterated water. GSM was rapidly degraded using the TiO2 batch reactor, with the rate of GSM degradation most affected by light intensity and additional reactants, though pH also had a notable effect. A kinetic isotope effect of 1.61 was observed for the destruction of GSM using Hombikat K01/C TiO2. The flow reactor was also found to efficiently degrade GSM in raw waters. The rate of GSM destruction was found to be significantly lowered by UV shielding of the catalyst, caused by constituents of raw the water used, and the presence of additional reactants. The pilot scale flow reactor was also successfully evaluated in Denmark using gesomin contaminated water from an eel farm","bibo:AuthorList":["Bellu, Edmund","Robertson, Peter K.

Works are sculpted, formed, and worked within a space frame by additive, accumulative and sometimes reductive processes. The synthesis of making and idea are fundamental. Overarching themes are responses to autobiographical, archaeological, cultural and environmental sources that connect to the contextual framework of how artists respond to geographical location or sense of place. The complex interplay of themes/possibilities to the ecology of making and how this is transcended, remain the main focus of research. For the University of Central Florida exhibition, \"Six Royal Scottish Academy Artists\", six artists were invited from the membership of the Royal Scottish Academy to show a diversity of practice in Scottish Art. The gallery director, Kevin Haran, made studio visits in 2002 to select the work. A small full colour publication was produced and funded by the University of Central Florida Art Gallery for the exhibition. The publication states “The artists in this exhibition, all elected members of the Academy, certainly warrant the accolade ‘Artist of Merit’ and all have established enviable reputations in Scotland and abroad”. Other artists included John Bellany; Ian Howard; Jack Knox. Ian Howard was invited to give an illustrated talk at the opening of the exhibition. All costs involved in the curation of this exhibition were met by the gallery.

The survey was carried out by means of a postal questionnaire to all prior students and generated a 45% response rate. The results show that graduates of the course are finding posts in what has been described as the emerging market for information professionals. The primary sectors of activity identified are posts in IT, in research, in information service provision and in financial and policy analysis. Respondents found that the skills gained from the course were relevant to their\nemployment situation and criticisms of course content tended to focus upon IT\nprovision. The paper concludes that further research into the nature of duties carried out by those employed in this sector would have value, as would investigation of the avenues which graduates follow in successfully finding first and subsequent posts.

The first was a survey of former and current students of the School of Information and Media at The Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, which examined why they had chosen to undertake an undergraduate course in information and library studies. The second was a survey of fifth and sixth year pupils at six secondary schools in North East Scotland, and gathered market research data as to the appeal of a range of course and module titles, in order to determine which were attractive to prospective students. Major findings include: that former and current students were largely influenced by subject content and vocational field in their choice of course; that former students are likely to have gone into the non-conventional or ‘emerging’ information job market, regardless of their having come to the course\nwith a vision of a career in a traditional library sector; and that despite Librarianship and Information Studies being an instantly recognisable and very clearly defined working environment, most prospective students surveyed do not find the course content attractive or potentially interesting. The paper concludes that the ILS\nprofession should: collect and present evidence demonstrating the variety, challenges and satisfactions of information careers; reappraise the role of degree level\nqualifications in feeding into the job market; and develop routes into those sections of employment which information professionals are presently failing to enter.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marcella, Rita","Baxter, Graeme"],"dc:date":"2001-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4152211,"sim:weight":0.48068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158918,"sim:weight":0.376059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155856,"sim:weight":0.356106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.349572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78564,"sim:weight":0.348797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9631121,"sim:weight":0.32397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156060,"sim:weight":0.320212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.312521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154539,"sim:weight":0.308518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162458,"sim:weight":0.3082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160825,"sim:weight":0.287317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4150549,"sim:weight":0.283631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158959,"sim:weight":0.28289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154826,"sim:weight":0.282442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.282442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162456,"sim:weight":0.279792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154519,"sim:weight":0.273042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160882,"sim:weight":0.269119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156063,"sim:weight":0.268117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4150529,"sim:weight":0.264976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Results reveal the wide range of subjects that are of interest to MEPs; that all MEPs have research assistants to help in their work, with an average of 3.5 assistants per MEP; the majority of these assistants are based in the UK and are employed full-time; and that the most popular sources were unofficial, informal contacts and MEPs’ own files, as opposed to the official EU databases and services. Finds that the main problems faced by MEPs in information retrieval are pressure of time and the overwhelming number and variety of information sources available.

In this article, the letters of women to the editor of the\nAberdeen Daily Journal, 1900 to 1914, are analysed to discover the type of political issues with which these women concerned themselves. It is argued that the women must have felt particularly strongly about such issues since they were prepared to take their arguments outside their social circle and to identify themselves as politically active in the pages of their daily newspaper. Political issues dealt with include local government, the suffrage question and government legislation. While much of the evidence used comes from the letters of active suffragists who were usually members of national suffrage\nassociations, it is argued that the period showed an expansion in the type of woman interested in politics, and the corresponding urge to write to the newspapers. This is evidenced in the number of women who firmly stated that they were not suffragists, but became politicised enough to write to the newspaper complaining about the Insurance Act in 1912.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pedersen, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2002","doi":"10.1080/09612020200200343","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.387199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108193,"sim:weight":0.383067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316097,"sim:weight":0.378491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108902,"sim:weight":0.358559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385375,"sim:weight":0.356353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316067,"sim:weight":0.350828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108847,"sim:weight":0.346903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316073,"sim:weight":0.331595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":315976,"sim:weight":0.32725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.317404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.296756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108885,"sim:weight":0.295861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108960,"sim:weight":0.293668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.288535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.287148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108857,"sim:weight":0.262877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930362,"sim:weight":0.241394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58691,"sim:weight":0.237899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29421,"sim:weight":0.210093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.203449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In\nthe first example application, the proposed methodology is compared to the sensitivity\nanalysis technique. The break-even point has been correctly identified in almost all cases. Furthermore, it has been shown how the employed fuzzy methodology may be seen as a generalised sensitivity approach to which has been added a measure of the precision with which input variables are known to the decision-maker. In the second example application, the proposed methodology is compared to two probabilistic techniques: the confidence index method and the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique.

Invitation was a consequence of exhibiting at international Print Biennales in: Varna, Bulgaria 2001 (a major Prizewinner); International Biennale of Drawing and Graphic Arts in Gyor, Hungary 2003 (invited artist, only Scot) ISBN 963 212 249 6); International Triennale of Graphic Art in Bitola, Macedonia 2001 (ISBN 9989-9896-1-3). The work explores issues of ‘place’ – my working context being rural and remote from mainstream artistic centres. Delicate Structures and Centre Spot are comments on the changing landscape of the north east of Scotland, from rural to semi industrial and the notion of ‘worth’. The prints (each 230 x 330 mm) were executed using the intaglio process developed by myself and taught at an annual workshop at the Printmaking Centre (also now at the Institute of American Indian Arts) Santa Fe, New Mexico. This specific process, along with examples of from my work and working practices, are described in the new book Collagraphs and mixed media printmaking. Harthill, B. and Clarke, R.

However, the use of video telephony and video conferencing applications for BSL communication is limited by inadequate video quality.\nBSL is a highly structured, linguistically complete, natural language system that\nexpresses vocabulary and grammar visually and spatially using a complex combination\nof facial expressions (such as eyebrow movements, eye blinks and mouth/lip shapes),\nhand gestures, body movements and finger-spelling that change in space and time.\nAccurate natural BSL communication places specific demands on visual media applications which must compress video image data for efficient transmission.\nCurrent video compression schemes apply methods to reduce statistical redundancy\nand perceptual irrelevance in video image data based on a general model of Human\nVisual System (HVS) sensitivities.\nThis thesis presents novel video image coding methods developed to achieve the\nconflicting requirements for high image quality and efficient coding. Novel methods of prioritising visually important video image content for optimised video coding are\ndeveloped to exploit the HVS spatial and temporal response mechanisms of BSL users\n(determined by Eye Movement Tracking) and the characteristics of BSL video image\ncontent. The methods implement an accurate model of HVS foveation, applied in the\nspatial and temporal domains, at the pre-processing stage of a current standard-based\nsystem (H.264). Comparison of the performance of the developed and standard coding systems, using methods of video quality evaluation developed for this thesis,\ndemonstrates improved perceived quality at low bit rates.\nBSL users, broadcasters and service providers benefit from the perception of high\nquality video over a range of available transmission bandwidths.

However, despite thirty years’ research from a variety of perspectives into destination image and image formation, the impact of actual visitation has been largely neglected and understanding of the processes involved in that change is therefore limited. Visitor experience is increasingly\nrecognised as being unique to the individual, leading to calls for research strategies taking into account the visitor’s perspective. This study uses a phenomenological approach to investigate\nvisitor-destination interactions, capturing visitors’ lived experience as expressed in their holiday narratives. Applying a double hermeneutic approach to analysing interview data, this study outlines the elements of destination experience and shows how the meaning encapsulated in the individual’s destination image is mediated by his/her stock of knowledge, the particular combination of predispositions, motivations and characteristics, as well as by their in-destination interactions and encounters with people and place. It develops the ideal typifications of Gourmet, Grazer and Gourmand to help explain the complex and dynamic interaction between visitor characteristics and behaviour and extends our understanding of the role of other tourists in destination experience by\nilluminating tourist-tourist interactions and revealing the compromises necessitated by the presence of other tourists. By generating insight into the complex and dynamic interaction between anticipations, motivations and predispositions, and the way in which this interaction affects the\nvisitor’s experience of people and place in a destination, the study has demonstrated the utility of the phenomenological approach in understanding visitor interactions. It has also resulted in a model which explains the processes whereby the visitor makes sense of his/her experience and transmits that experience to others.

To a lesser extent, it has more recently addressed upward and 360 degree appraisal systems. In contrast, the role of informal upward communication continues to be largely neglected, especially when it concerns the transmission of opinions critical of managerial orthodoxy. There has been little examination of the sensemaking heuristics employed by both managers and non-managerial staff that stimulates the former to disregard much of the already muted critical upward communication they receive, and the latter to suppress its transmission in the first place. We therefore suggest that managers often over commit to particular courses of action, irrespective of whether they bode ill or well for the organization concerned. In so doing, they frequently demonise those who belong to stigmatised outgroups or who hold contrary value systems. We argue that the consequent elimination of critical upward communication (henceforth, CUC) leads to iatrogenic phenomena – i.e. organizational problems that are derived from the treatment regime that has been prescribed, rather than from a pre-existing condition.

Technological advances in an ever-changing and complex clinical environment mean that certain acute clinical skills have become routine for the qualified nurse and yet few educational institutions and NHS Trusts in the UK have seen the need to address this within the pre-registration nursing curricula.\nThis study, questions whether the pre-registration nursing curricula is failing\nnewly qualified nurses by not adequately preparing them to cope with the complexities of practical skills within the clinical environment. This skill deficit is rectified on qualifying when nurses rapidly equip themselves with skills that are considered essential for practice.\nUsing a constructivist paradigm and a mixed methods research approach, the opinion of key stakeholders in pre-registration nurse education was sought. Focus groups and surveys were conducted with skills teachers to ascertain essential skills. Constructive alignment theory (Biggs 1999) was tested with two student cohorts from a pre-registration nursing programme (n\u003d58). Comparisons were made between an experimental group who acquired certain skills during their pre-registration programme and a control group who had not acquired those additional skills. The programme was evaluated using Stake’s (1967) countenance model of evaluation. Data were analysed using SPSS, constant comparative analysis and triangulation.\nThe findings confirmed that nurses should acquire the skills investigated in this study, but differences of opinion were found as to when this was acceptable. Favourable results for the experimental group were\ndemonstrated indicating the need to provide nurses with the additional skills prior to qualifying. The study also identified other like-minded UK nurse educators who had been innovative with their skills’ curricula. Nursing curricula can be successfully underpinned by an educational theory such as\nconstructive alignment providing added value to the learner and enablingnurses to enter the profession fit for practice and purpose.\nTo further enhance the quality and standard of provision, the following are recommended: strengthening the collaborative relationships between the key stakeholders for nurse education, as well as promoting interprofessional learning and skills development.

They are more likely to\nproduce strategies that are misaligned with the perceptions of their employees. The\npossibility of successful strategic implementation is therefore dramatically reduced.\nThis suggests that two way communication and critical feedback is vital to organisational success. The problem is that most of us are suspicious of any feedback to the effect that our behaviour, decisions or most cherished beliefs are in error. We react\ninstinctively against it – what has been called the automatic vigilance effect. Moreover, most of us are also reluctant to transmit critical information, recognising that the hostile reaction of recipients may endanger our standing in their eyes, and possibly damage our careers. We therefore exaggerate how much we agree with the opinions of people who have a higher status than us – the ingratiation effect. This causes managers to form inaccurate impressions of the climate within their organisations, with dangerous strategic consequences. This article explores the problems that these dynamics create for companies. It examines the benefits that can be obtained from institutionalising more critical upward feedback into an organisation’s communication systems.

In particular, the past twenty years have witnessed an explosive growth of interest in what has been termed ‘transformational leadership’ (henceforth, TL). The theory is closely linked to the growth in what has been defined as corporate culturism – an emphasis on the importance of coherent cultures, as a means of securing competitive advantage. This paper outlines the central components of TL theory, and subjects the concept to a critical analysis. In particular, similarities are identified between the components concerned and the characteristics of leadership practice in organizations generally defined as cults. This connection has been previously unremarked in the literature. These similarities are comprehensively reviewed. Trends towards what can be defined as corporate cultism in modern management practice are also discussed. We conclude that TL models are overly concerned with the achievement of corporate cohesion to the detriment of internal dissent. Such dissent is a vital ingredient of effective decision-making. It is suggested that more inclusive and participatory models of the leadership process are required.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tourish, Dennis","Pinnington, Ashly"],"dc:date":"2002-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67277,"sim:weight":0.374478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155079,"sim:weight":0.313214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.211588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.159034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.111724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Evidence mounts each year to the effect that most\nsuch interviews are poorly managed, fail to improve organisational performance,\ndemoralise employees and subject the managers who administer them to intolerable\nlevels of stress. No wonder that one researcher, unkindly but accurately, has described\nthem as ‘the annual fiasco’ (Pickett, 2003, p.237). It is typical of the data that a\nconference of human resources professionals found over 90% of those present\ndeclaring that, if given the chance, they would modify, revise or even eliminate the\nperformance appraisal system currently used in their organisations (HR Focus, 2000).\nThus, appraisal interviews are governed by some seemingly impregnable assumptions\nthat research nevertheless suggests may be invalid – e.g. that organisations are\nrational entities, administrative systems are highly reliable, and most people can be\ntrained to be unbiased and candid in their assessments of others (McCauley, 1997).\nSome have even argued that traditional appraisals are so inherently dysfunctional that\nthey need to be abolished altogether (e.g. Coens and Jenkins, 2000). Their ongoing\npopularity represents another instance of hope triumphing over experience.\nThis chapter therefore offers a different perspective to that often found in the\nliterature, particularly practitioner guides that instruct on ‘how to’. Firstly, I define\nwhat appraisal interviews are and outline the range of roles they are expected to\nperform. Flowing from this, the voluminous evidence that indicates why appraisals\ngenerally fail to work is reviewed. It would be tempting to outline a series of steps and skills that appear to avoid these problems, as many texts do (e.g. Bacal, 2003;\nSandler and Keefe, 2003). However, the conclusion offered here is that such\npiecemeal perspectives are more likely to compound the problem than resolve it. In\nparticular, it is argued that most people are inherently poor at receiving criticism. We\nare so sensitive to it that even if critical feedback forms only a small part of the\nappraisal process it is likely to be regarded by the recipient as representative of the\nentire interview. The evidence clearly suggests that when such perceptions arise they\nderail the main intended point of the appraisal interview – which is to improve\nperformance. But we are also poor at giving accurate criticism or feedback more\ngenerally. For example, managers are inclined to exaggerate the personal contribution\nthat people make to negative outcomes and under-estimate the role of systems in\nproducing poor performance (Gray, 2002). There is no compelling reason to believe\nthat training or any other intervention will so improve the attitude of most people to\neither giving or receiving critical feedback that appraisal interviews will become\neffective for most people in most organisations in the near future. This chapter\ntherefore outlines a framework to move organisations beyond appraisal interviews,\nand in the direction of both self appraisal and counselling interviews that, with\nsufficient support, are more likely to create a regular celebration of positive\nperformance rather than the annual fiasco mostly endured today.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tourish, Dennis"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108027,"sim:weight":0.377942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58839,"sim:weight":0.356669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.33128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.321232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.319027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.301952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.300623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.285437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5941,"sim:weight":0.282827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182212,"sim:weight":0.270154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181798,"sim:weight":0.26828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340561,"sim:weight":0.262261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99226,"sim:weight":0.250959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271238,"sim:weight":0.228955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Yet it is a commonplace that communication is poor in most.\nEmployees complain that they neither know nor understand corporate priorities, while\nfrustrated senior managers insist that they have invested a great deal of time in\nexplaining them. There is additional evidence that information transmission from the\nbottom to the top is also defective, with employees and even managers fearing to\narticulate their true opinions to those further up the hierarchy (Rosenfeld et al., 1995).\nThus, senior managers often have a very limited understanding of the communication\ndynamics within their own organisation. In our own research in this field, we have\nfrequently found that the people most surprised by audits which point to problems are\nthe senior management team (Hargie and Tourish, 2000). The result can be a climate\nof mutual suspicion rather than trust, with energies that should be focused on beating\nthe competition squandered in internal struggles. In this chapter, we suggest that the\nkey to building a world-class communication system lies in managers having an\naccurate picture of how well they and everyone else are actually communicating. In a\nnutshell, we advance a twofold argument: 1. All organisations need a focused communication strategy, designed to\nbuild a world class system for sustaining internal communications.\n2. The first step in implementing the above is that current practice must be\nrigorously and honestly evaluated, utilising communication audit\ntechniques.\nWe then discuss in-depth how audits can be implemented, and the data collection\noptions available. While the main focus of this chapter is upon internal\ncommunications, audits are also of importance for external communications, and so\nwe raise issues of relevance to the latter area as well.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tourish, Dennis","Hargie, Owen"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58839,"sim:weight":0.294289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.289252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108269,"sim:weight":0.282029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.277976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108603,"sim:weight":0.259156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183850,"sim:weight":0.244032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186346,"sim:weight":0.232429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.215333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, we note how three generations of engineers have been variously affected since Israel was founded in 1948. Each era brought with it different needs and different socio-economic circumstances. Some pushed engineers into enterprise, but later, we show how pull factors have determined the Israeli entrepreneurial milieu. However, for all eras, we find that learning to become an entrepreneur was a lifelong process, an amalgam of experience moulded with formal learning. These elements fused self and circumstance to determine the career trajectories of our enterprising engineers. Although this study is based on Israeli data, the conditions for the third generation reflect global convergence. Accordingly, the learning process for new engineers can be anticipated as universal.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chorev, Schaul","Anderson, Alistair R."],"dc:date":"2006","doi":"10.1504/IJCEELL.2006.010956","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108700,"sim:weight":0.254589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162908,"sim:weight":0.243604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.20893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.178678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58839,"sim:weight":0.174359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.167722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159504,"sim:weight":0.163855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.157103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.138796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.134905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The background problematic is that in Europe, agriculture has faced dramatic pressures for restructuring, and facilitation of the strategic skills of farmers and a stronger entrepreneurial orientation have been suggested as a possible solution for the emerging problems. We use an illustrative case to show how strategy formation and implementation may require different skills, competencies and attitudes. Design, methodology and approach – A case study is used to examine the issues of strategy formation and implementation. Whilst the findings from the case may not be generalisable, our analysis provides an opportunity to conceptually reflect on the issues. These issues may have wider implications beyond the research site. \nFindings – The theoretical and case study analyses reveal that the concept of entrepreneurial strategy is ambiguous. Yet, if proper care is taken to distinguish the concept from, and relate it to, the elements in which it is embedded, the notion is a useful tool for both theory and empirical investigation. By applying such a procedure, we show that the contexts of conventional farming and business diversification call for an understanding about the clearly different entrepreneurial skills and appropriate strategies and strategic implementation. \nPractical implications – This research suggests that a major challenge for the agricultural sector is to enable farmers to develop their strategic, marketing and entrepreneurial skills. This requires economic support and greater emphasis on education and training.

Our multi stage methodology enrolled the wisdom and experience of founders, managers and financiers of high-tech businesses to identify and categorise the importance of the factors and the role played by these factors. We found that success factors could be grouped as critical or as important. The first group categorised the idea, strategy, the core team\u0027s commitment, expertise and marketing as critical. Important factors were deemed to be management, customer relationships and research and development. The least important factors proved to be those external to the firm, the economy, politics and the general business environment.

Managers are becoming ever more dependent on information, on which to base business decisions, but less able to extract this information from the overwhelming amount of data which they receive. In order to manage this problem, many organisations have introduced an executive information system (EIS) into their information systems infrastructure.\nThe theory of EIS implementation has been well covered by researchers. The purpose of this paper is to review how the theoretical approaches have been utilised by UK organisations. To achieve this a survey was conducted of companies that were known to be using, or considering the use of, an EIS. The successes and limitations of the system implementations are analysed from the survey. To augment the successes companies have achieved, lessons are identified from the implementation methods employed by comparing them with the theoretical approaches in the literature. These findings will be useful for organisations planning to introduce an EIS, or as a comparison for companies who already have installed a system. The results should also inspire further research about, and improvements of, the EIS development tools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allison, Ian"],"dc:date":"1996-02","doi":"10.1016/0268-4012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Adding to the growing body of qualitative research, this approach overcomes some of the criticisms of interpretive studies, especially the need for the research to be reflexive in nature.\n\nOur longitudinal analysis of the case study shows SPI to be an emergent rather than a deterministic activity: the design and action of the change process are shown to be intertwined and shaped by their context. This understanding is based upon a structurational perspective that highlights how the unfolding/realisation of the process improvement (intent) are enabled and constrained by their context. The work builds on the recognition that the improvements can be understood from an organisational learning perspective. Fresh insights to the improvement process are developed by recognising the role of the individual to influence the improvement through facilitating or resisting the changes. The understanding gained here can be applied by organisations to enable them to improve the effectiveness of their SPI programmes, and so improve the quality of their software.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allison, Ian","Merali, Yasmin"],"dc:date":"2007-06","doi":"10.1016/j.infsof.2007.02.003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.301357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108269,"sim:weight":0.288964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.272898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182212,"sim:weight":0.220658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.199745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is argued that such destinations are extremely vulnerable to changes in visitor perception and that the effects of national disasters impact disproportionately. The twinned conceptions of the local and the global are employed to show how the time-space compression of globalisation is a double-edged sword. The paper first offers a theoretical explanation based on the symbolic otherness of peripheral places. In the first instance, this otherness attracts, but symbolic constructions are brittle things, and the advent of national disaster turns this otherness into a repelling force. We then offer some data on the uneven effects of foot and mouth disease. This demonstrates how the local of peripherality is vulnerable to the sensationalism of the global. We find that the lenses of perceptions of place magnify the good and the bad. But significantly, peripheral tourist places suffer most.","bibo:AuthorList":["Irvine, Wilson","Anderson, Alistair R."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.231532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.22508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.213035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931333,"sim:weight":0.196306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999538,"sim:weight":0.131212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A person reading a book needs to understand themes and concepts\nwithin the context. Schank’s Dynamic Memory theory suggested that building on\nexisting memory structures is essential to cognition and learning. Pirolli and Card\nemphasized the need to provide people with an independent and improved ability to\naccess and understand information in their information seeking activities. Through a\nreview of users’ reading behaviours and of existing e-Book user interfaces, we found\nthat current e-Book browsers provide minimal support for comprehending the\ncontent of large and complex books. Readers of an e-Book need user interfaces that\npresent and relate the organizational and narrative structures, and moreover, reveal\nthe thematic structures.\nThis thesis addresses the problem of providing readers with effective scaffolding of\nmultiple structures of an e-Book in the user interface to support reading for\ncomprehension. Recognising a story or topic as the basic unit in a book, we\ndeveloped novel story segmentation techniques for discovering narrative segments,\nand adapted story linking techniques for linking narrative threads in semi-structured\nlinear texts of an e-Book. We then designed an e-Book user interface to present the\ncomplex structures of the e-Book, as well as to assist the reader to discover these\nstructures.\nWe designed and developed evaluation methodologies to investigate reading and\ncomprehension in e-Books, in order to assess the effectiveness of this user interface. We designed semi-directed reading tasks using a Story-Theme Map, and a set of\ncorresponding measurements for the answers. We conducted user evaluations with\nbook readers. Participants were asked to read stories, to browse and link related\nstories, and to identify major themes of stories in an e-Book. This thesis reports the\nexperimental design and results in detail. The results confirmed that the e-Book\ninterface helped readers perform reading tasks more effectively. The most important\nand interesting finding is that the interface proved to be more helpful to novice\nreaders who had little background knowledge of the book. In addition, each\ncomponent that supported the user interface was evaluated separately in a laboratory\nsetting and, these results too are reported in the thesis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sun, Yixing","Harper, David J.","Watt, Stuart N.

Within learning disability service there has been\nincreasing attention on physical and sexual abuse as well as attention being\ngiven to abuse as it is perceived by people with learning disabilities.\nThe aim of this study was to explore the views of staff working within learning\ndisability services regarding their views of vulnerability and abuse.\nA phenomenological approach was adopted, as this is a subject about which\nlittle is known and the lived experiences of care staff and the meanings that they\nattach to them were being explored. Semi-structured interview was the chosen\nmethod for data collection. Twenty informants shared their views in this study.\nThe data generated were themed and the findings were presented in two\ndifferent but complementary styles: case studies and themes representative\nacross the entire sample.\nThis research has highlighted a number of important issues. There is\nconsiderable difference in the meanings given to vulnerability by care staff and\nthe range of meanings are further complicated when notions of risk are\nconsidered. A model is presented that illustrates experiences of vulnerability\nand confidence of the individual the impact of various experiences on those\nstates. For example negative experience of bullying might increase\nvulnerability whilst positive family support might engender feelings of\nconfidence.\nThe study showed that staff are more influenced by personal and family values\nthan by policy. Though this study focused on adult protection policy it was\nevident that this also applied in the case of other policy.\nThe strong influence of personal values pervades all aspects of care.

It aims to\ninvestigate whether collaborative storytelling can encourage students to reflect on,\nand learn from, each others’ experiences of assessment. In order to examine these\naims, an on-line tool, ‘StoriesAbout… Assessment’ was designed and developed,\nbased on an adapted model of storytelling as a reflective tool in higher education.\nVisual representations of students’ experiences were also used to identify the\naffective aspects of the assessment experience. In using these novel methods, the\nresearch aimed to highlight the whole student learning experience and how\nassessment affects that experience. Traditional methods of surveying and evaluation\ndo not usually focus on this, nor do they provide a reflective, learning process for\nstudents.\nThe analysis of stories led to a greater understanding of students’ experiences of\nassessment in art and design by identifying a number of key issues: the impact of\nnegative experiences, the need for greater clarity of assessment criteria due to the\nsubjective nature of the discipline, the tension students perceive between their role as\ncreative practitioners in an educational setting and their role in the wider art world,\nthe value of peer support and appropriate feedback. The storytelling model enabled\nstudents to view stories from different perspectives and to consider changes to their\npractice, and the model has demonstrated its efficacy in supporting reflective\nthinking and transformative learning. The emotional aspect to students’ experiences\nwas particularly evident in their visual representations which often used strong\nimagery to depict how the stress of assessment affected them. The drawings also\nshowed stereotypes of assessment, such as images of exams, indicating that these\nprevious experiences had become synonymous with assessment, despite there being\nfew formal exams in art and design.\nIn summary, this thesis contributes two new methods for understanding and\nenhancing the student learning experience, which have been proven in the context of\nart and design higher education.","bibo:AuthorList":["McKillop, Chris","Malins, Julian Paul","Gray, Carole"],"dc:date":"2006-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.511461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57679,"sim:weight":0.428361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9631121,"sim:weight":0.402576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.387877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108108,"sim:weight":0.38494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.374374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.362548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58825,"sim:weight":0.359524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.342751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56680,"sim:weight":0.332283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.323706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.323618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85548,"sim:weight":0.319731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.317362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.315321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its ability to generate jobs as well as income\nmakes it a key part of the drive towards economic growth, and as such it is supported\nby government through a variety of initiatives. One initiative in 2003 aimed to\nenergise and invigorate practitioners into using internet based technologies more fully\nin their business practices. This supported the widely held belief that the internet can\nand does enhance and improve business efficiency. It also suggests that SMEs were\nnot fully engaging with the technology and that the government felt that it was not at\nthe desirable level. This thesis looks at the issues surrounding technology acceptance\nfor the SME and in particular internet adoption in the retail sector.\nThis work explains technology acceptance and the main determinants and moderators\nconnected with this in an organisational setting providing the practitioner with insight\ninto why some technologies are embraced and others underutilised, or not adopted at\nall. Previous academic work in this area has tended to focus on the larger\norganisation. This thesis uses the technology acceptance literature to explore the\nsituation of the SME. Through qualitative and quantitative research the specifics of\nthe SME situation relating to technology acceptance are explored with the\ndeterminants and moderators being evaluated and changes made where appropriate.\nThe specific internet based technology of online procurement is used to measure\nlevels of acceptance and the issues relating to it.\nThe result is an adapted model that better reflects the technology acceptance situation\nof the SME retail organisation. In the model three of the original constructs remain,\nhowever the moderators have been changed to reflect the SME and the relationships\nthe constructs have with the moderators are also developed. As a new addition to the field it can be seen from the developed model that the frequency of re-ordering is an\nimportant determinant not only of online procurement but technology acceptance in\ngeneral. This work will benefit practitioners in SME retail and also the wider SME\nfield when it comes to evaluating whether or not to accept a new technology and how\nthis is best achieved.","bibo:AuthorList":["Connon, Neil G.","Donaldson, Bill","Anderson, Alistair R.","Pirie, Iain","Thyne, Maree"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.27258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316083,"sim:weight":0.239749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183850,"sim:weight":0.196689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.196238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158997,"sim:weight":0.1949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.192038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The literature is fairly comprehensive in its coverage of the evolution of online searching, and of new developments such as OPACs (Online Public Access Catalogues), CD-ROM systems, expert systems, and image storage systems. It would have been possible to write a book on these topics but that task has already been completed by the authors of no less than three books which have appeared in Britain.1,2,3\nThe different approaches which have been taken to aspects of education and training, including the development of simulations and the place of online searching in the curriculum have also been thoroughly considered. After completing an initial review of this extensive literature, it became apparent that it would probably be most useful to draw attention to a number of issues which do not appear to have been widely discussed.\nCertain aspects of the British experience could be of particular significance for future development in those countries where online searching is not yet as widely practiced. These relate particularly to the impact of assistance and encouragement for experimental research; the impact of end-users\u0027 appreciation of the potential of online information services; and the implications of teaching online systems (and other forms of library automation) for curriculum development, student recruitment, funding, and the position of the Schools of Librarianship within their parent institution. These issues are not fully discussed in the existing literature, but have a long-term significance far greater than the solution of the technical problems associated with online searching. The paper therefore attempts to highlight some of those issues, drawing upon the literature and the author\u0027s observations of developments in Britain in the last ten years.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, Ian M."],"dc:date":"1991-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.338837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.306111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.302841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154826,"sim:weight":0.302841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162458,"sim:weight":0.296629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108416,"sim:weight":0.290153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155556,"sim:weight":0.286879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55971,"sim:weight":0.281918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.280946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.259213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4150838,"sim:weight":0.255742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151943,"sim:weight":0.247018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154719,"sim:weight":0.246927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933572,"sim:weight":0.23981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.23981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98717,"sim:weight":0.21172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151878,"sim:weight":0.20076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157413,"sim:weight":0.192556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155349,"sim:weight":0.175386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This\nbuilding is part of a wider project, launched in 1988 by the late President Mitterrand, to\ncreate a library of a ‘wholly new conception’ which should cover all aspects of knowledge, be\naccessible to all and be electronically linked to the rest of the European library network. This\nproject subsequently included the modernisation of the Bibliothèque Nationale and became\nthe project of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. This review aims to clarify the purpose\nof the building in the context of the existing French national library and the pattern of\ninformation services in France. The paper reviews the contextual elements before focusing on\nthe building itself. These elements include the concept of national libraries in the modern\ninformation environment; an overview of the French library scene; the history of the project\nhighlighting the factors which influenced the planning strategy; the legacy of the old\nBibliothèque Nationale as well as the associated programme towards the creation of an online\nlibrary service. The new building is described from a structural and operational view\npoint and is evaluated in terms of its functionality as a library and in terms of its place in the\ncontext of the French national library. The review emphasises that the construction of such a\nbuilding had a political purpose and suggests that its substantial operating cost combined\nwith the policies of strict austerity imposed by the current French government are likely to\njeopardise not only the efficiency of the new library itself, but also the modernisation of\nFrench library services.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Sylvie C.","Johnson, Ian M."],"dc:date":"1998-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Artificial Neural Networks form the foundation of the research and their units, Artificial Neurons, are first compared with alternative models.  This initial work is mainly in the spatial-domain and introduces a new neural model, termed a Taylor Series neuron.  This is designed to be flexible enough to assume most mathematical functions.  The unit is based on Power Series theory and a specifically implemented Taylor Series neuron is demonstrated.  These neurons are of particular usefulness in evolutionary networks as they allow the complexity to increase without adding units.  Training is achieved via various traditiona and derived methods based on the Delta Rule, Backpropagation, Genetic Algorithms and associated evolutionary techniques.  This new neural unit has been presented as a controllable and more highly functional alternative to previous models.\nThe work on the Taylor Series neuron moved into time-domain behaviour and through the investigation of neural oscillators led to an examination of single-celled intelligence from which the later work developed.\nConnectionist approaches to Artificial Intelligence are almost always based on Artificial Neural Networks.  However, another route towards Parallel Distributed Processing was introduced.  This was inspired by the intelligence displayed by single-celled creatures called Protoctists (Protists). A new system based on networks of interacting proteins was introduced.  These networks were tested in pattern-recognition and control tasks in the time-domain and proved more flexible than most neuron models.  They were trained using a Genetic Algorithm and a derived Backpropagation Algorithm.  Termed \"Artificial BioChemical Networks\" (ABN) they have been presented as an alternative approach to connectionist systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Capanni, Niccolo Francesco","MacLeod, Christopher","Maxwell, Grant M."],"dc:date":"2006-08","doi":"10.1109/CIMCA.2005.1631452","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5834896,"sim:weight":0.376135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86966,"sim:weight":0.357578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496425,"sim:weight":0.317648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931407,"sim:weight":0.295288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23722,"sim:weight":0.293096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.271557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934499,"sim:weight":0.248164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99078,"sim:weight":0.242215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108624,"sim:weight":0.237694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332856,"sim:weight":0.235392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20346,"sim:weight":0.230156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20350,"sim:weight":0.216655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933695,"sim:weight":0.21577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87106,"sim:weight":0.205064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99378,"sim:weight":0.201372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271201,"sim:weight":0.181546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim was to utilise an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of past provision to shed light upon present\npractice and planning for the future: focussing upon that form of ‘difference’\nwhich has been given the name ‘learning difficulty’.\nThe research utilised records, interviews, narratives and discussion groups to\nexplore the experiences of providers of services, service users and those who\nwere close to them. The research sought to go beyond description; to facilitate\nrespondents in sharing their understanding of the organisation of care services\nand how it had an effect upon their life chances and self concept.\nThe design of the research, which made use of multiple sources of evidence,\nwas qualitative in its approach. It was undertaken within four ‘sites of interest’:\n The archive or the historical record of provision at Lhangbyde Hospital..\n Through semi structured interviews with ‘Providers’\n A ‘Punters’ discussion forum located within a self advocacy group.\n A set of ‘Intimate Narratives’.\nThe method had its roots in constructivist, reflective and post modern currents of\nthought which confronted the difficulty inherent is making an epistemological\ndistinction between what is out there in the world and the categories of meaning\nwhich are resident in the human mind. The goal was to produce texts which\npromoted dialogue rather than monologue, were evocative rather than definitive, In chapter 8 some ‘Intimate Narratives’ from the researcher’s own life\nexperience as a father and as a facilitator and adviser within a self advocacy\norganisation were presented directly as stories of everyday experience.\nIn the final two chapters of the thesis an attempt was made to synthesise the\noverall findings of the research, and to assess their implications for future policy\nand practice. In chapter 9, under the heading of ‘Reading the Chart:\nunderstanding the past and present as a foundation for future planning’ the\nfindings from the four ‘sites of interest’ were gathered together under seven\nexplanatory themes, with the section entitled ‘Gaining a Voice’ achieving an\noverall pre-eminence.. The last chapter in the thesis (Chapter 10), under the title\nof ‘The Future Course’ detailed a plan for change and development based on a\nsynthesis of findings. In addition the role of future research in promoting change\nwas examined.

Researchers have been investigating the construct of sales\ncontrol, its antecedents and its consequences on both the individual sales person and on sales\nforce performance.\nThis research project analyses how and why the sales control systems are implemented the way\nthey are. The basis for this approach is drawn from the organisational or management control\nliterature which treats behaviour and outcome approaches as dimensions rather than\ncategories. Organisational control also treats the control system as a process which consists of a\nset of stages or sub processes being objective setting, planning, monitoring, feedback and\ncorrecting. With the growing importance of relationship selling and key account management it\ncan no longer be assumed that all the sales people will operate at the same hierarchical level\nwithin an organisation nor that they will be subject to one and the same control system.\nTherefore an in depth analysis of how sales force control processes are implemented for\ndifferent types of sales functions, ranging from customer acquisition, small to medium account\nmanagement to strategic and global account management, is needed.\nThe research project included 17 preliminary interviews across different organisations, from\nwhich one organisation was selected on the basis that it contains a large international sales\nforce of about 2.500 people consisting of a very wide range of sales functions. The analysis of\nthis organisation included 100 plus interviews of 66 sales managers and sales people across all\ntypes of sales functions over a two year period. The findings show that the inability to measure certain inputs and outputs does not deter a\nsales organisation to adopt their sales control strategy within a functional sales team. When\nsome measures are not available or are unreliable, sales managers find other ways to measure\nthem being it through some locally developed tools or through more qualitative approaches.\nThe method used to obtain certain measures does impact the level of the sophistication of the\nactual control process or strategy. When there is a need to control sales people who operate as\na team of employees from different departments the sales managers can no longer individually\ndevelop some local tools to measure inputs and outputs. The findings show that team based\nselling requires accurate data but also globally agreed rules and procedures in order to operate\nsuccessfully. This enables us to conclude that the inability to measure certain inputs and outputs\nis a determining variable for the implementation of client sales teams.\nWith regard to sales force control strategies the research uncovered that within the category of\nthe hybrid sales control approach there are four types of sales control sub approaches. The\nchoice of which control to use is dependent on the size of the customers or opportunities the\nsales people work with and the selling approach which is either hunting or farming. This shows\nthat while farming can be relabelled as key account management, hunting remains a major sales\nactivity requiring not only different selling approaches it also requires different types of sales control processes than for farming.\nAll of these findings indicate that several types of sales control systems can operate across one\nsingle organisation and that the main determining variables are the sales approach and the type\nof accounts the sales person is managing. This challenges current beliefs or assumptions that all\nsales people operate at the same hierarchical level within an organisation and that they all\noperate under one single sales control approach. Future research on sales force control will need to take these findings into account when designing their approach to study control\nsystems within organisations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lemmens, Regis","Donaldson, Bill","Tourish, Dennis"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.239337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585490,"sim:weight":0.215555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.199642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183850,"sim:weight":0.197979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.197525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53666,"sim:weight":0.194814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99451,"sim:weight":0.173345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, many of the early reports were later proved to be unreliable, and subsequent reports correcting that information have been less well publicized. Moreover, the mass media have focused on a few well-known institutions, and paid little attention to the post-war reconstruction efforts. This paper aims to provide a more rounded and reliable picture, based on a critical reading of a wide range of official and unofficial media, and summarizes the scattered information in the public domain about the overall situation up to the end of 2004. A brief note of the main reconstruction programmes is followed by an outline of some of the contextual issues relating to the rehabilitation of Iraq\u0027s library and information services. An extended review of what has been reported about the impact on individual elements of the professional panorama in Iraq covers not only the National Library and Archives, but also the university libraries and significant special libraries, as well as noting the limited information available about college, school, and public libraries. The state of the main archival collections is outlined, and an appendix lists the minor collection and their reported condition. It concludes with an examination of the human resource issues. Finally, the paper discusses the problems that have arisen through the lack of quality information about events during the conflict and continuing civil disorder in Iraq, and some issues relating to current and future reconstruction efforts. The paper points to the need not only to repair damaged buildings, replace looted equipment and make good the deficiencies in collections, but also to mobilize and modernize the indigenous professional workforce to implement the reconstruction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, Ian M."],"dc:date":"2005-09","doi":"10.1016/j.iilr.2005.07.005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930627,"sim:weight":0.392524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.280831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.259605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.242033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158609,"sim:weight":0.225548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933572,"sim:weight":0.218109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.218109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109140,"sim:weight":0.202528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54706,"sim:weight":0.161473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.137095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the ever increasing number\nof websites in the Web has made it extremely difficult for users to find the right informa-\ntion that satisfies their current needs. In order to address this problem, many researchers\nexplored Web Mining as a way of developing intelligent websites, which could present the\ninformation available in a website in a more meaningful way by relating it to a user’s\nneed. Web Mining applies data mining techniques on web usage, web content or web\nstructure data to discover useful knowledge such as topical relations between documents,\nusers’ access patterns and website usage statistics. This knowledge is then used to develop\nintelligent websites that can personalise the content of a website based on a user’s prefer-\nence. However, existing intelligent websites are too focussed on filtering the information\navailable in a website to match a user’s need, ignoring the true source of users’ problems\nin the Web. The majority of problems faced by users in the Web today, can be reduced\nto issues related to a website’s design. All too often, users’ needs change rapidly but the\nwebsites remain static and existing intelligent websites such as customisation, personalisa-\ntion and recommender systems only provide temporary solutions to this problem. An idea\nintroduced to address this limitation is the development of adaptive websites. Adaptive\nwebsites are sites that automatically change their organisation and presentation based on\nusers’ access patterns. Shortcutting is a sophisticated method used to change the organi-\nsation of a website. It involves connecting two documents that were previously unlinked in\na website by adding a new hyperlink between them based on correlations in users’ visits.\nExisting methods tend to minimize the number of clicks required to find a target document\nby providing a shortcut between the initial and target documents in a user’s navigational\npath. This approach assumes the sequence of intermediate documents appearing in the\npath is insignificant to a user’s information need and bypasses them. In this work, we\nexplore the idea of adaptive websites and present our approach to it using wayposts to\naddress the above mentioned limitation. Wayposts are intermediate documents in a user’s\npath which may contain information significant to a user’s need that could lead him to his\nintended target document. Our work identifies such wayposts from frequently travelled\nusers’ paths and suggests them as potential navigational shortcuts, which could be used\nto improve a website’s organisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bathumalai, Ganesan","Craw, Susan","Hermann, Frank"],"dc:date":"2008-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.328012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176886,"sim:weight":0.314969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98772,"sim:weight":0.297633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.294811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.286066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.280875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.277627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930463,"sim:weight":0.275132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932725,"sim:weight":0.263252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827200,"sim:weight":0.234351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98493,"sim:weight":0.225502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930973,"sim:weight":0.219833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.209952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70175,"sim:weight":0.196039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997743,"sim:weight":0.188776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99366,"sim:weight":0.16425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It considers the general features of Management Information Systems, particularly automated systems, and reviews the general development of automated library systems in British academic libraries.\n\nIt then examines the current state of development of Management Information Systems in some British academic libraries.  To illustrate developments, a survey of eight academic libraries in England and Scotland was undertaken in late 1991.  The results of the survey showed that automated Management Information Systems are not widely available to library managers.  Only two of the eight libraries made much use of their library automation systems for management information.  \n\nProblems to be overcome include the crude form of data provided by existing automated library systems, a lack of agreement on what data is required for management purposes, and a lack of expertise on the part of library staff in interpreting data.  The cost of establishing Management Information Systems and the absence of Management Information systems in the parent institutions had also inhibited their widespread adoption by academic libraries.  However, it appears that the introduction of Management Information systems poses no threats to library staff, because most libraries already have a \u0027flat\u0027 management structure.  The preferred option of most of the librarians is to await the future development of the more advanced Decision Support Systems, but the implementation of such systems may encounter similar obstacles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gumilar, Dudung","Johnson, Ian M."],"dc:date":"1995","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8933664,"sim:weight":0.369493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108607,"sim:weight":0.271518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108139,"sim:weight":0.246769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108603,"sim:weight":0.245756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60055,"sim:weight":0.236064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59026,"sim:weight":0.235224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.231261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.211526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154826,"sim:weight":0.211526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.211444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.201785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155556,"sim:weight":0.194058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162458,"sim:weight":0.190292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.18349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.149858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29843,"sim:weight":0.126936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Czech Socialist Republic (CSR) covers the western areas of the country, traditionally known as Bohemia and Moravia. The eastern portion, Slovakia, forms the Slovak Socialist Republic (SSR). The educational system is controlled separately by the Ministers of Education in each Republic, but the Federal government takes a close interest in the state and development of educational work.\nSince World War II, substantial progress has been made in the development of education in Czechoslovakia, particularly in Slovakia where education had been comparatively neglected by the Austro-Hungarian government prior to the establishment of the Czechoslovakian Republic at the end of World War I. Emphasis has been placed on the development of higher education and, under the influence of the Russian system, with programmes of study adapted to the economic and cultural needs of the country as perceived by government planners.\nThe aim of schools is to educate the youth and the working people to function as socially useful citizens of the republic. Nine years of compulsory basic schooling, beginning at the age of six, is followed by a four-year secondary programme. This programme can be completed in the \"gymnasia\" (general secondary schools), in vocational secondary schools, or in apprentice training schools. Students can take the school leaving certificate at any of these types of secondary schools.\nThe first courses for librarians were offered in Czechoslovakia in 1918, and the first library school was established in 1920 under the control of the Ministry of Education and Culture. A school of librarianship was established in Charles University, Prague, in 1927, but it was re-established in the early 1950s following the amalgamation and re-organisation of three schools of librarianship in Prague.\nDuring the same period, in the early 1950s, the first of the specialist secondary schools was opened, the vocational secondary school for librarians in Brno. Today, there are two university schools of librarianship, in Prague and Bratislava, and three secondary schools for librarians, in Prague, Bratislava and Brno.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, Ian M."],"dc:date":"1984-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.411953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154826,"sim:weight":0.411953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4153480,"sim:weight":0.410876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154941,"sim:weight":0.38779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4153487,"sim:weight":0.36931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159127,"sim:weight":0.367328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4153848,"sim:weight":0.363478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4153479,"sim:weight":0.362234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157374,"sim:weight":0.360542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109032,"sim:weight":0.355881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181799,"sim:weight":0.33602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162399,"sim:weight":0.334564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225645,"sim:weight":0.328005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108230,"sim:weight":0.323488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109064,"sim:weight":0.321959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159015,"sim:weight":0.292326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162656,"sim:weight":0.268456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108904,"sim:weight":0.265485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99434,"sim:weight":0.251281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4153716,"sim:weight":0.241162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A result of this is that design of new drugs is more often being limited only by\nthe ability of synthesis techniques to produce them. The development of new\nsynthesis techniques is therefore always of great interest. Among these techniques is\nsemiconductor photocatalysis, most well known for its use in the clean-up of\ncontaminated water; however it is capable of a wide range of reactions, from\noxidation to cyclisation. This study examined some of the factors and influences\ninvolved in the applications of the technique for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones.\nFor the photocatalysis the steroid 6β-hydroxy-3α,5-cyclo-5α-androstan-17-one was\nsynthesised, a compound with suspected antiprogesterone properties. A feature of the\ncompound is the presence of a cyclopropane group within the A ring. It was\nsynthesised easily through normal techniques; the presence of the cyclopropane group\nhowever makes the safe oxidation of the compound a difficult task.\nThe photocatalytic oxidation studies started with cyclohexanol as the base compound;\nthis is the target area of the steroid without the influences of the other rings.\nDerivatives of cyclohexanol were used to study the effect of neighbouring groups on\nthe reaction rate. The compounds used were 2-methylcyclohexanol, menthol, 2-\nchlorocyclohexanol and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthol; these being chosen to give a\nmixture of compounds with electron donating and electron withdrawing groups. It was found that the presence of electron donating groups gave a slower reaction rate\nwhile electron withdrawing groups gave a faster reaction rate. The reaction rate of\n1.066x10-8 mol s-1 for the cyclohexanol dropped to 1.023x10-8 mol s-1 with the\naddition of the methyl group in 2-methylcyclohexanol. However the chloro group\nraised the rate to 1.689x10-8 mol s-1. The rate increased further due to the presence of\nthe benzene ring in 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthol. These results showed the influence of\ninduction on the compound, the groups affecting the electron density around the\nhydroxyl group. It was also found that the catalyst used had a large impact on the\nreaction rate; the anatase to rutile ratio had an effect but the major influence was the\nsurface area of the catalyst. In cyclohexanol conversions of 41% were achieved with\nUV100 and 38% with PC500. The P25 gave a conversion of 43% but the Aldrich\nanatase just 25%.

Third, there is also little evidence that with firms in the top and bottom performance deciles have different internal governance characteristics.

On a firm level, companies with a high pre-LBO free float and comparatively weak monitoring by shareholders tend to show high abnormal returns.

Standard Evolutionary Algorithms, used in this application include: Genetic Algorithms, Evolutionary Strategies, Evolutionary Programming and Genetic Programming; however, these often fail in the evolution of complex systems, particularly when such systems involve multi-domain sensory information which interacts in complex ways with system outputs.  The aim in this work is to produce an evolutionary method that allows the structure of the network to evolve from simple to complex as it interacts with a dynamic environment.  This new algorithm is therefore based on Incremental Evolution. A simulated model of a legged robot was used as a test-bed for the approach.  The algorithm starts with a simple robotic body plan.  This then grows incrementally in complexity along with its controlling neural network and the environment it reacts with.  The network grows by adding modules to its structure - so the technique may also be termed a Growth Algorithm.  Experiments are presented showing the successful evolution of multi-legged gaits and a simple vision system.  These are then integrated together to form a complete robotic system.  The possibility of the evolution of complex systems is one advantage of the algorithm and it is argued that it represents a possible path towards more advanced artificial intelligence.  Applications in Electronics, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace are also discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Muthuraman, Sethuraman","Maxwell, Grant M.","MacLeod, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934499,"sim:weight":0.347152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86187,"sim:weight":0.341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386398,"sim:weight":0.320966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86712,"sim:weight":0.317403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933695,"sim:weight":0.302446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934278,"sim:weight":0.297625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86814,"sim:weight":0.294127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":381647,"sim:weight":0.272308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86546,"sim:weight":0.271044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12718,"sim:weight":0.262678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.227783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932481,"sim:weight":0.227395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931240,"sim:weight":0.226431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.223525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.223195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25806,"sim:weight":0.192017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms have been shown to be strongly modulated in many androgen sensitive tumour cell lines. Increased expression of some PKC isoforms has also been linked to immortality in many cancer cell lines. Conjugated linoleic acids(CLAs) are naturally occurring positional and geometric isomers of the fatty acid linoleic acid (LA). CLAs have been shown to reduce growth and increase apoptosis in breast cancer cells, and to alter their PKC expression both in animal models and in various human cell lines. We investigated the effect of CLA on the oestrogen sensitive MCF-7 cell line, and the oestrogen insensitive MDA-MB-231 cell line for 24 hours at two different concentrations of CLA (25Mu M and 50Mu M, optimum concentrations, previously shown in our lab). We measured the variations of three PKC isoforms (Alpha, Delta, and Iota) in the cytosol (inactive form) and the membrane (active form), as well as the mRNA expression of each in MCF-7 after 12 hours of treatment at 50Mu M concentrations. The activation of PKC was measured by Western Blot analysis, using PKC isoform specific antibodies and Beta-actin, or Claudin-3 as the housekeeping protein. Results indicate that the CLA isoforms used (the 911, 1012 and a 50/50 mix of the two) cause a decrease in cell viability in both cell lines. It was observed that the activation of PKC Alpha was decreased in MCF-7 cells, compared to the control, while the activation of PKC Delta and Iota was increased. In the MDA-MB-231 cell line PKC Iota activation was decreased at both concentrations, while PKC Alpha and Delta activation showed no particular pattern. mRNA expression of PKC Alpha and Iota was generally decreased after treatment with 50Mu M of CLA, while PKC Delta mRNA expression increased. These effects are similar (but not identical) to the ones seen in prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC3), which have been previously reported by our lab. It appears that CLA supplementation influences PKC isoform mRNA expression and protein activation in breast cancer cells. While the mRNA expression occurs in a pattern which appears to fit with that found in previous research the protein activation does not follow the trends suggested by work in other cell lines. It appears that the expression and activation of PKC isoforms are not just influenced by the interactions between CLA isoforms and the PKC genes in breast cancer cells.","bibo:AuthorList":["Crabb-Wyke, Rosemary H.","Wahle, Klaus","Kong, Paul Thoo Lin"],"dc:date":"2008-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5730965,"sim:weight":0.318274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23815,"sim:weight":0.286144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99085,"sim:weight":0.263307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931557,"sim:weight":0.252531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99171,"sim:weight":0.23336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4869738,"sim:weight":0.222472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.193996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.181827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.180536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.148254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23977,"sim:weight":0.148254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.141974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.140378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.132031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98832,"sim:weight":0.12884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98971,"sim:weight":0.126686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397436,"sim:weight":0.12362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.108318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Israel is small and geographically isolated from the main markets,\nsuffers from security difficulties, but fosters a culture which promotes knowledge rich\nnew technologies. Thus, new ventures with leading edge technologies and prospects of\nhigh growth and profitability offer a means to achieve the national goal of economical\nindependence. Internationally however, the high-technology sector has recently\nsuffered badly from the bursting of the dot.com bubble and the crash of the Nasdaq.\nPrior to the collapse, the remarkable enthusiasm for new high-technology ventures led\nto quite unrealistic expectations about the profitability and sustainability of many of\nthese new companies. A characteristic of companies formed during the overheated\nperiod was the elevation of ideas over substance and in particular, the lack of a sound\nbusiness practices. Nonetheless, the potential value of these high-technology companies\nis recognized and there is some evidence of their gradual re-emergence under difficult\ncircumstances. To aid the sustainability of this re-emergence, this study addresses the\nissue of viable business models that could enhance the prospects of success. Such a\nmodel of best practices, if properly grounded in the experiences of both successful and\nunsuccessful entrepreneurs, may provide a template to guide the formation and\noperation of new and growing high-tech companies. The contribution of this paper is\ntwofold, first to collate the experiences of practitioners and secondly, to synthesise\nthese into a model that identifies factors critical for success, and factors that are\nimportant, but not deemed essential and the roles they play in shaping success.\nThus the study captures the implicit knowledge embedded in the experiences of\nentrepreneurs and others who are, or have been, engaged in the realities of high-tech\nventure creation. It categorises and synthesises this material and by analysis, establishes\na practical model specifying the factors and their criteria seen to be critical for\nimproving the success of high-technology new ventures. We developed a multi stage\nstudy, consisting of multiple interviews of key players to develop a model, which was\nthen tested and refined in a pilot and a final survey. The nature of this study thus\nprovides empirical evidence regarding the factors deemed necessary for successful\nhigh-tech venturing in Israel. The paper begins by considering the role of high-tech\nventures for economic growth generally and in Israel in particular. We then explain our\nmethodology that builds upon the existing literature. Key factors and their roles are\nidentified. From this, we present our initial findings as a tentative model which we\noperationalised in our pilot study. Our revised questionnaire was completed by some 80\nexperts and finally refined in a Delphi review. From these data we arrive at our final\nmodel.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chorev, Schaul","Anderson, Alistair R."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.303184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.298963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.291535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14072,"sim:weight":0.284343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185846,"sim:weight":0.225634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.208774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.208016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.151733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In a semantic space, a term\ncan be considered as a concept represented geometrically as a vector, the components of which\ncorrespond to terms in a vocabulary. A primary way to perform reasoning in a semantic space is\nto categorize concepts in the space into a number of regions (i.e., groups). Such a process is\nreferred to as concept induction, which can be realized by clustering objects in the space. The\nresulting groups can potentially form a basis for knowledge discovery and ontology construction.\nConventional clustering algorithms, e.g., the K-Means method, normally produce crisp clusters,\ni.e., an object could be assigned to only one cluster. It is not always the case in reality. For\nexample, a word “Reagan” may belong to both the cluster about administration of US\ngovernment, and another one about the Iran-contra scandal. Therefore, a membership function is\napplied, which determines the degree to which an object belongs to different clusters. This\nchapter introduces a cognitively motivated semantic space model, namely Hyperspace Analogue\nto Language (HAL), and shows how a fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm is used to concept\ncategorization in the high dimensional semantic space. The experimental results indicate that\napplying fuzzy C-Means clustering over the HAL semantic space is promising in constructing\nsemantically related groups of terms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Song, Dawei","Cao, Guihong","Bruza, Peter D.","Lau, Raymond Y.

No\nliterature was found which dealt with this topic, and it was therefore thought that,\nrather than ask users to make a selection from arbitrarily-chosen designs, it would be\ninformative to consult the users from the beginning of the design process.\nTo this end, a Grounded Theory methodology was adopted, and users were selected\nfrom postgraduate students and staff from Information Management courses at the\nRobert Gordon University, Aberdeen. Three “rounds” of interviews were conducted.\nThe first round was concerned with finding out what ideas for a world design people\nwould have, the second with testing four worlds derived from the first round, and the\nthird with exploring further ideas that users had, based on their experience of the test\nworlds.\nAt each stage of the process, emergent theories were constructed, and modified\naccording to subsequent findings. It was established that the factors which influenced\nthis group of users in their preferences for the design of worlds were not structural, as\nmight have been assumed, but instead were related to properties such as familiarity,\norganisation, assistance, and quality of information and presentation.\nWhen the results were examined in the context of developments in the use of virtual\nenvironments, it was found that they provide a theoretical underpinning for practices\nsuch as the provision of “conventional” library structures in the popular online\nenvironment Second Life.\nThis is not a statistical exercise, but it would appear that there are no significant\ndifferences based on the criteria of age, gender, or whether a user was staff or student.\nMore thorough studies would be required to determine this absolutely, but for the\nmoment it appears more useful to draw a broad set of conclusions.\nii\nIssues were identified which indicate potentially rewarding areas for further research\nand design. Specifically, it would be of interest to discover whether the affective\nresponses of these groups are also common to other groups, and to experiment further\nwith worlds designed in the light of the current findings. Further investigation of the\nsmall number of cases in which users do not respond to the worlds would also be\ndesirable, to determine whether this response is characteristic of a group of people\nwho will not react positively to any world, or whether these users simply reacted\nnegatively to the examples presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacLennan, Alan"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99250,"sim:weight":0.375379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.356863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.334372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.325663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9631121,"sim:weight":0.295178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.291383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57679,"sim:weight":0.238999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Treatment with H2O2 alone and following pre-treatment with EPA\nor DHA had no effect on the levels of protein carbonyls in U937 cells, however,\nDHA supplementation did appear to reduce endogenous and H2O2-induced protein\ncarbonylation. Marked differences in the uptake of fatty acids by the cell types were\nfound and the IMR-32 cell line was most susceptible to the oxidant challenge.\nHydroxytyrosol gave significant cytoprotection in all three cell lines and this\npossible neuroprotective efficacy warrants further investigation, both in vitro and in\nvivo. Treatment of the three cell lines with a high concentration of H2O2 for 30min or\n4 hours did not induce a significant increase in MDA. U937 cells were supplemented\nfor 24 hours with fatty acids followed by a 4 hour oxidative stress. Both EPA and\nDHA treatment appeared to reduce LOOH levels in the U937 cells but not\nsignificantly. Cytoplasmic PLA2 activity in the three human cell lines was examined\nand the basal level of cPLA2 activity was found to be comparable in the\nlymphoblastoid and IMR-32 cells but significantly lower than that measured in the\nU937 cells. Supplementation of the U937 cell line with EPA caused a significant\ndecrease (p\u003c0.05) in cPLA2 activity relative to the vehicle treated control but neither\nEPA nor DHA supplementation appeared to have any significant effect on either\ntotal PLA2 or cPLA2 activity in IMR-32 or lymphoblastoid cell lines.\nAbstract v\nHuman Studies: No significant difference was found between the levels of ethane\nand pentane in the breath from the schizophrenic patients and control samples. In\naddition, no significant difference in the levels of plasma MDA between the two\ngroups was detected. Ethane levels and MDA levels were higher in the male\nschizophrenic samples than in the female schizophrenic samples but the results were\nnot statistically significant. The pentane levels were higher in the female\nschizophrenic samples when compared to the male schizophrenia samples but again,\nthese were not significantly greater. Finally, results of study 2 revealed that cellular\nDNA damage and plasma protein carbonyl levels were increased in the\nschizophrenic group compared to control subjects but not significantly. However,\nDNA damage in lymphocytes from the male schizophrenic group was significantly\nhigher than the female group. Biomarkers of lipid peroxidation and plasma vitamin\nC levels also revealed no significant difference between the two groups under\ninvestigation, although a significant elevation in plasma vitamin C was observed in\nthe female control group when compared to the male groups.\nTreatment of cells with EPA, DHA and hydroxytyrosol to reduce levels of oxidative\ndamage warrants further investigation. Ultimately, it is important to investigate a\nrange of biomarkers to determine whether the measurement of oxidative damage to\nlipids, proteins and DNA has clinical significance. This will enable better\nunderstanding of the disease of interest and allow these biomarkers to become\npotentially useful clinical tools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Young, Julie","Boyle, Susanne","Glen, Iain","Wahle, Klaus"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5846252,"sim:weight":0.368771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5731393,"sim:weight":0.345786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.343403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23977,"sim:weight":0.343403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269999,"sim:weight":0.304048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269997,"sim:weight":0.266325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.263169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8754,"sim:weight":0.249095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.248382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.233371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.21959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.184553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.174858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22728,"sim:weight":0.165283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22742,"sim:weight":0.162395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Semiotics, the doctrine of signs, is a useful tool for exploring\nthe depth and scope of what we mean by entrepreneurship. Consequently this chapter argues\nthat an appreciation of entrepreneurial semiotics enables an understanding of the meanings of\nenterprise; what it is; how it is practised; why it is practised and why it is encouraged. Many of\nthese meanings lie at the ideological level, they are taken for granted, often implicit, rarely\nexplicit, but analysis of entrepreneurial symbolism gives us some purchase in understanding.

Yet, despite this uptake they currently exist on the margins of entrepreneurship\nresearch. Indeed, Rae (2001) criticised entrepreneurship researchers for failing to make fuller\nuse of sophisticated qualitative methodologies in researching at the frontiers of\nentrepreneurship. This chapter argues that there are valid structural and career orientated\nreasons why this is so. We argue that qualitative researchers often have to ‘dare to be different’.\nWriting up qualitative research is difficult because a judgement call has to be made whether to\ntailor the research towards a standard journal article or whether to allow the research to dictate\nthe style and presentation of the finished article. ‘Daring to be different’ may be a valued\nentrepreneurial trait and hence should be one that was appreciated by journal editors or\nreviewers in the field – alas, it is rarely so. Academic careers and reputations are built upon the\nreputation of achieving repeated publication in respected journals and by adhering to the\nconformity of accepted disciplinary peer conventions. Consequentially, this chapter documents\nthe development of a research and publication strategy of one of its authors, suggesting some\nalternative publication strategies.

The health implications for those affected and the lack of sustained success\nin treatment, demands that new strategies be explored to improve patient outcomes (Harvey\net al. 2005). Primary care nurses appear well placed to address obesity management.\nTherefore, the aim of this research was to develop and evaluate an evidence based, holistic,\nperson centred approach to management, which was relevant to both professionals and\nthose who are obese.\nA conceptual framework was developed to encompass the physical, social and emotional\ncomponents of weight management in conjunction with the nursing models of Roper,\nLogan and Tierney and Peplau. The approach used mixed methods of data collection,\nwhich was carried out in two phases. Outcomes from the initial exploratory, longitudinal\nsurvey phase, involving 64 outpatients attending a specialist obesity clinic, showed that\nphysical, social and emotional factors, in conjunction with beliefs about weight\nmanagement are interrelated.\nEvidence from the exploratory phase contributed to the development of materials for the\nintervention phase which was implemented in primary care by nine practice nurses (PNs)\nwho recruited 28 obese individuals for a three month period. Methods of data collection\nincluded questionnaires, booklets, field notes and interviews.\nii\nThe key findings of this study confirmed that obesity is complex and a holistic, person\ncentred approach to weight management through partnership working between nurses and\nobese individuals can be effective. While PNs have a key role to play in obesity\nmanagement they recognised their need for appropriate tools and education to help\nindividuals towards self-management.

Our LRD method extracts terms and entities, such as person, organization, or project names, and discovers relationships be-tween them by taking into account their co-occurrence in textual corpora. Given a target entity, LRD discovers other entities closely related to the target effectively and efficiently. With respect to such relatedness, a measure of rela-tion strength between entities is defined. LRD uses relation strength to enhance the vector space model, and uses the enhanced vector space model for query based IR on documents and clustering documents in order to discover complex relationships among terms and entities.

It presents retrieved documents in an order of\ntheir estimated degrees of relevance to query. Traditional document rank-\ning methods are based on different measurements of similarity between\ndocuments and query. Due to information explosion and the popularity\nof WWW information retrieval, the increased variety of information and\nusers makes it insu±cient to consider similarity alone in the ranking pro-\ncess. In some cases, there is a need for user to retrieve documents which\nare generally or broadly describing a certain topic. This is particularly\nthe case in some specific domains such as bio-medical IR. To satisfy the\nstringent requirement of generality based retrieval, we propose a novel ap-\nproach to re-rank the retrieved documents by considering their generality\nas a compliment. By analyzing the semantic cohesion of text, document\ngenerality can be quantified. The retrieved documents are then re-ranked\nby their combined scores of similarity and the closeness of documents\u0027\ngenerality to the query\u0027s.

Given a search topic, a prominent existing approach is to apply some information retrieval (IR) system to retrieve top ranking documents, which will then be used to derive associations between experts and the search topic based on cooccurrences. However, we argue that expert finding is more sensitive to multiple levels of associations and document features that current expert finding systems insufficiently address, including (a) multiple levels of associations between experts and search topics, (b) document internal structure, and (c) document authority. We propose a novel approach that integrates the above-mentioned three aspects as well as a query expansion technique in a two-stage model for expert finding. A systematic evaluation is conducted on TREC collections to test the performance of our approach as well as the effects of multiple windows, document features, and query expansion. These experimental results show that query expansion can dramatically improve expert finding performance with statistical significance. For three well-known IR models with or without query expansion, document internal structures help improve a single window-based approach but without statistical significance, while our novel multiple window-based approach can significantly improve the performance of a single window-based approach both with and without document internal structures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhu, Jianhan","Song, Dawei","Ruger, Stefan"],"dc:date":"2009-04","doi":"10.1002/asi.21012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1394250,"sim:weight":0.451772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394178,"sim:weight":0.443592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394002,"sim:weight":0.416345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5839424,"sim:weight":0.308523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933209,"sim:weight":0.270333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997910,"sim:weight":0.24694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394174,"sim:weight":0.225344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26271,"sim:weight":0.214209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930909,"sim:weight":0.183243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.180116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.170632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These techniques are based on computer modelling of\nbiological evolution or foetal development. They are known as Evolutionary, Genetic\nor Embryological methods. Specifically, Embryological techniques are used to grow\nArtificial Neural Network topologies. The Embryological Algorithm is an alternative\nto the popular Genetic Algorithm, which is widely used to achieve similar results.\nThe algorithm grows in the sense that the network structure is added to incrementally\nand thus changes from a simple form to a more complex form. This is unlike the\nGenetic Algorithm, which causes the structure of the network to evolve in an\nunstructured or random way.\nThe thesis outlines the following original work: The operation of the Embryological\nAlgorithm is described and compared with the Genetic Algorithm. The results of an\nexhaustive literature search in the subject area are reported. The growth strategies\nwhich may be used to evolve Artificial Neural Network structure are listed. These\ngrowth strategies are integrated into an algorithm for network growth. Experimental\nresults obtained from using such a system are described and there is a discussion of\nthe applications of the approach. Consideration is given of the advantages and\ndisadvantages of this technique and suggestions are made for future work in the area.\nA new learning algorithm based on Taguchi methods is also described.\nThe report concludes that the method of incremental growth is a useful and powerful\ntechnique for defining neural network structures and is more efficient than its\nalternatives. Recommendations are also made with regard to the types of network to\nwhich this approach is best suited.\nFinally, the report contains a discussion of two important aspects of Genetic or\nEvolutionary techniques related to the above. These are Modular networks (and their\nsynthesis) and the functionality of the network itself.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacLeod, Christopher","Maxwell, Grant M.","Miller, A.","Elder, S."],"dc:date":"1999","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8933695,"sim:weight":0.315411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99378,"sim:weight":0.309921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.307031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934499,"sim:weight":0.306767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998976,"sim:weight":0.304513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934278,"sim:weight":0.289718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930678,"sim:weight":0.286644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20350,"sim:weight":0.286516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98531,"sim:weight":0.282367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98526,"sim:weight":0.223744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.130947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A common theme in the literature is the creation of value and its extraction from the environment. Rural entrepreneurship potentially covers a wide gamut of activity including the illegal. Also studies into agricultural entrepreneurship particularly traditional accounts of \"rurality\" tend to emphasise the rural idyll. Most studies tend to concentrate on the application of entrepreneurial theory to issues of rurality and as such exist on the margins of entrepreneurship research - being primarily studies into rurality and not entrepreneurship per se. Rarely do such studies impinge on issues of illegal enterprise that shatter this rural idyll. As a consequence, rural and farming rogues have been neglected as subjects of research. Yet, in the present perceived climate of economic decline in agricultural income, extracting value from the environment can be difficult and can give rise to illegal enterprise in the countryside as well as an increase in the prevalence of farming rogues. The case story, presented in this paper relates to one such illegal enterprise, namely the illegal slaughter of sheep for the Muslim \"halal\" market, known to those in the know as the smokies trade. Using the case story methodology this paper explores an issue of contemporary illegal enterprise in the countryside telling an important story that is otherwise difficult to evidence empirically.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert"],"dc:date":"2004","doi":"10.1108/13552550410544231","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.320617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.312738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50360,"sim:weight":0.273673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914334,"sim:weight":0.228509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.226936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85288,"sim:weight":0.225455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.203615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85514,"sim:weight":0.198204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109002,"sim:weight":0.189917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.187361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447739,"sim:weight":0.182804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.176315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.176196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.146628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The purpose of this research paper is to explore the decline of subsistence entrepreneurship in a ?Scottish Fishing Community?, namely the village of Gourdon in Kincardineshire, Scotland over a 60-year period. Design/methodology/approach ? Presents the material in a historical perspective, as remembered by two persons who lived through the experience. Using two ethnographic accounts the paper reconstructs a vivid picture of a thriving form of subsistence type entrepreneurship, in a bygone era, when enterprise was more closely bonded to community activities, the work ethic and pride. Findings ? This paper narrates a dramatic story relating to the economic decline visited upon a living community by the forces of market change affecting multiple income streams. In this tale, there are no heroes or villains, as is normal in narrative accounts, merely victims of changing circumstances and changing patterns of social action. Research limitations/implications ? The results of this research paper have obvious limitations, because of the methodology employed, and because of the limited number of respondents interviewed. However, socio-historical studies such as this have their place in developing an understanding of entrepreneurship as enacted in individual communities. Originality/value ?

The research takes a holistic\napproach to the investigation of the first year experience. In part, a\ncurriculum change is used as a way to find out about the first year\nexperience, with the research looking at how the introduction of enquirybased\nlearning (EBL) into a curriculum impacted on the first year. The\ncurriculum change is described in detail in chapter 1. The objectives of the\nthesis were to:\n1. Examine the first year experience of nursing students.\n2. Describe the curriculum change, the rationale for the change and the\ncontext within which this occurred.\n3. Compare the demographic profiles of two groups of students one\nfollowing a ‘traditional’ curriculum and the other using ‘EBL’; to\ncompare students who chose to leave the courses with those who\nsuccessfully completed first year.\n4. Compare experiences with expectations of first year between nursing\nstudents undertaking a ‘traditional’ and an ‘EBL’ curriculum.\n5. Propose strategies to enhance the student experience and rates of\nretention in first year undergraduate nursing students.\nThe context for the research is described in chapter 1 – the literature\nreview. This chapter explores the literature on the first year experience\nfrom both national and international perspectives. Inevitably, it reviews\nissues relating to student retention, which is the focus for much of the first\nyear experience literature. The literature review argues that the\ncontemporary context of nursing education requires nurse educators to\nconsider the whole first year student experience when developing curricula\nthat are fit for purpose. While the content of a course is important, the\napproaches to teaching need to facilitate learning within a diverse student\npopulation and need to prepare students to continue to learn in an\nincreasingly dynamic healthcare environment. The chapter goes on to\n2\nargue that the issues that impact on the students’ first year experiences\n(e.g. relationships with peers and with academic staff, external domestic\nand personal circumstances) can be mitigated through curriculum\ndevelopment and other means (such as the availability and effectiveness of\nstudent support). The context of the particular nursing course along with\nthe curriculum change and the rationale for the change are described.\nIt can be argued that the retention literature takes a deficit approach to the\nimprovement of the first year experience. Such an approach can be viewed\nas one that emphasises the factors that cause people to leave (or puts\nthem ‘at risk’), and attempts to address these. On the other hand, a\npositive approach to the improvement of the first year is one in which\nmeasures and interventions aim to enhance the overall experience for all\nstudents, not just those who are seen as ‘at risk’. That said, the policy\ndrivers for improving retention cannot be ignored and are discussed within\nthe context of HE and nursing education. Finally, it is contended that the\nfirst year experience has not been widely explored within nursing literature\nand merits attention for a number of reasons, including the policy context\nand the need to determine whether student nurses have differing needs\nfrom students within other specialities.\nIn chapter 2 the research methodology and research methods are\ndescribed. An overview of case study research is provided and the\napproach taken within this thesis is described, along with a rationale for its\nuse. The philosophical perspective is discussed with particular emphasis on\nthe relationships between the methodology and the methods used to\ninvestigate the first year experience of students. It is argued that case\nstudy research is an appropriate methodology to investigate a complex\narea and provides an opportunity to utilise a number of methods so as to\nget to a ‘thick’ description of the phenomenon (the first year experience).\nAll students in the two groups under investigation were asked to complete\nan expectations questionnaire, and an experiences questionnaire. Everyone\nwho chose to leave the courses was asked to undertake an in-depth\nfocused interview, although not all agreed. A sample of students who\nsuccessfully completed first year was also asked to undertake an in-depth\n3\nfocused interview. Finally, a sample of students was asked to complete a\ndiary for the duration of the first year. The use of multiple methods is\nfitting, given the case study approach and the aim to create a ‘thick’\ndescription, and an in-depth understanding of the first year experience. The\nuse of the same research methods across the different groups of students\nallows for some comparisons to be made between the ‘traditional’ and ‘EBL’\ncurriculum students, and between leavers and stayers. The chapter also\ndescribes the approaches to data analysis.\nChapter 3 presents the findings from the two questionnaires. Relevant\ndemographic variables are reported, and the quality of the educational\nexperience is measured in relation to the ways in which experiences meet\nexpectations. This chapter shows that the two groups (‘traditional’ and\n‘EBL’) are similar in terms of demographic variables. It also shows that the\nparticipants appeared to expect a ‘connected’ curriculum experience, but\nthat the experience did not always match expectations.\nIn chapter 4 the findings from the interviews and diaries are presented.\nFour themes are identified, with a number of categories in each. The\nthemes (and categories) are: relationships with people (broadening\nhorizons, knowing self and others, being supported and valued); the\nclassroom experience (feeling inspired, becoming empowered, engaging\nwith the learning experience); the practice experience (feeling inspired,\nbecoming empowered, engaging with the learning experience); and\nprofessional education (motivation, preparedness, making adjustments).\nThe chapter demonstrates the differences and similarities between the\ngroups of students, before introducing the links to the quantitative findings,\nand to relevant research findings from the literature.\nChapter 5 – the Discussion - brings together the findings from the\nqualitative and quantitative data as the case study. A conceptual\nframework is presented as a way in which the findings can be framed and\nthrough which future research can be organised. The assertion is made that\nthe better the relationships, and the closer that experiences meet\n4\nexpectations, the more likely it is that the student will have a ‘good’\nexperience and therefore be successful.\nThe first year is seen as the foundation for future experiences on a course.\nWhile there are some areas that are particularly relevant to nursing\nstudents, it seems that the first year experience of student nurses is similar\nto that seen in other disciplines. Similar issues are identified within the\nthesis as within the wider literature, although nursing students’ issues may\nmanifest themselves in slightly different ways (e.g. issues with practice\nplacements/learning).\nIn chapter 6, a number of conclusions are drawn that may enable future\ncurriculum development to take a more holistic view of the student\nexperience. Recommendations for practice are made and a focus for future\nsystematic research is proposed. It is asserted that the conceptual\nframework that has been developed from the findings has allowed for a\ncontribution to be made to the theoretical debate that relates to enhancing\nthe first year experience and, in particular, to propose policy changes\nwithin the HE sector that may improve retention rates.\nThis opening section has provided the reader with the context from which\nthe ideas and focus for the thesis have developed, and has provided an\noverview of the aim and objectives of the research. It provided signposts\nfor the full thesis and its component parts. Chapter 1 – the literature review\n– aims to describe the context within which the research is situated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Taylor, Ruth Fiona","Lines, David","Wimpenny, Peter"],"dc:date":"2009-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.540616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.52366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155856,"sim:weight":0.498748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.487359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.48271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.468794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98600,"sim:weight":0.457965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.455971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.448229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.441424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98881,"sim:weight":0.437861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.430557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227223,"sim:weight":0.423219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.419286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.391234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98641,"sim:weight":0.333937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For example,\nan occupational therapist (OT) that assesses the needs of a new disabled person may\nbe reminded of a previous person in terms of their disabilities. He may or may not\ndecide to recommend the same devices based on the outcome of an earlier (disabled)\nperson. Case-based reasoning makes use of a collection of past problem-solving experiences\nthus enabling users to exploit the information of others’ successes and failures to solve\ntheir own problem(s). This project has developed a CBR tool to assist in matching\nSmartHouse technology to the needs of the elderly and people with disabilities. The\ntool makes suggestions of SmartHouse devices that could assist with given impairments.\nSmartHouse past problem-solving textual reports have been used to obtain knowledge for\nthe CBR system.\nCreating a case-based reasoning system from textual sources is challenging because it\nrequires that the text be interpreted in a meaningful way in order to create cases that are\neffective in problem-solving and to be able to reasonably interpret queries. Effective case\nretrieval and query interpretation is only possible if a domain-specific conceptual model\nis available and if the different meanings that a word can take can be recognised in the\ntext. Approaches based on methods in information retrieval require large amounts of data\nand typically result in knowledge-poor representations. The costs become prohibitive if\nan expert is engaged to manually craft cases or hand tag documents for learning. Furthermore,\nhierarchically structured case representations are preferred to flat-structured ones\nfor problem-solving because they allow for comparison at different levels of specificity thus\nresulting in more effective retrieval than flat structured cases.\nThis project has developed SmartCAT-T, a tool that creates knowledge-rich hierarchically\nstructured cases from semi-structured textual reports. SmartCAT-T highlights important\nphrases in the textual SmartHouse problem-solving reports and uses the phrases\nto create a conceptual model of the domain. The model then becomes a standard structure\nonto which each semi-structured SmartHouse report is mapped in order to obtain the\ncorrespondingly structured case. SmartCAT-T also relies on an unsupervised methodology\nthat recognises word synonyms in text. The methodology is used to create a uniform\nvocabulary for the textual reports and the resulting harmonised text is used to create\nthe standard conceptual model of the domain. The technique is also employed in query\ninterpretation during problem solving. SmartCAT-T does not require large sets of tagged\ndata for learning, and the concepts in the conceptual model are interpretable, allowing for\nexpert refinement of knowledge. Evaluation results show that the created cases contain\nknowledge that is useful for problem solving. An improvement in results is also observed\nwhen the text and queries are harmonised. A further evaluation highlights a high potential\nfor the techniques developed in this research to be useful in domains other than\nSmartHouse. All this has been implemented in the Smarter case-based reasoning system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Asiimwe, Stella Maris","Craw, Susan","Wiratunga, Nirmalie","Taylor, Bruce J."],"dc:date":"2009-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8998220,"sim:weight":0.350266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.321143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.307989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.305416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934119,"sim:weight":0.303516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151793,"sim:weight":0.288693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.263002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930751,"sim:weight":0.246109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.213355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9633940,"sim:weight":0.169362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Extensive empirical results show that these patterns perform\njust as well as the manually selected ones. This has important implications in terms of both the\ncost and the time spent in manual pattern construction.\nThe position of a phrase within a document is shown to have an influence on its sentiment\norientation, and that document classification performance can be improved by weighting phrases\nin this regard. It is, however, also shown to be necessary to sample the distribution of sentiment\nrich phrases within documents of a given domain prior to adopting a phrase weighting criteria.\nA key factor in choosing a classifier for an Ordinal Sentiment Classification (OSC) problem is\nits ability to address ordinal inter-class similarities. Two types of classifiers are investigated: Those\nthat can inherently solve multi-class problems, and those that decompose a multi-class problem\ninto a sequence of binary problems. Empirical results showed the former to be more effective with\nregard to both mean squared error and classification time performances.\nImportant features in an OSC problem are shown to distribute themselves across similar\nclasses. Most feature selection techniques are ignorant of inter-class similarities and hence easily\noverlook such features. The Ordinal Smoothing Procedure (OSP), which augments inter-class\nsimilarities into the feature selection process, is introduced in this thesis. Empirical results show\nthe OSP to have a positive effect on mean squared error performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mukras, Rahman","Wiratunga, Nirmalie","Lothian, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study challenges scholars who have predicted the development\nof a European mode of representation that would accompany the shift of competences\nfrom the national to the European level of governance.\nFollowing the establishment of a generic framework of design of corporate\npolitical strategies – based on the management literature – and adapted to the\nEuropean merger control regime context, French and British firms’ corporate political\nstrategies are thoroughly analysed. The comparison refines the original analytical\nframework. Moreover the conclusions of the comparative study show differences in\ncorporate political strategies along national lines, although a certain degree of\nconvergence can be identified.

It has been argued that\nthere is no moral space in entrepreneurship, but such instrumental views may miss out much of\nthe nature of enterprise and how it is understood. Consequently we propose that a sociallyconstructed\nperspective, based upon the meanings of entrepreneurship, may help to understand\nthe morality of entrepreneurship. By applying such a lens, we find that the narratives and\ndiscourses of the meanings of entrepreneurship are ideological and clearly present a moral space.\nThis space lies between the individual and society and is normatively articulated in\nentrepreneurial discourses. We develop a tentative framework which links values and outcomes\nthat shows how ‘authenticated’ entrepreneurship, that is to say that which resonates with a\nsocially approved moral dimension, is legitimized by comparisons with the socially constructed\nview. The empirical part of the paper comprises of two case stories. The first is a local garage\nowner who has a reputation as a decent man; the second is a notorious, but entrepreneurial\nLondon gangster. Our analysis shows that to be judged ‘entrepreneurial’, it is not enough to act\nentrepreneurially; the social constructs of public perceptions entail examining both moral means\nand moral ends.

The study will show the part played by\nparticipatory action in changing the conditions in which aesthetic experience\narises. It will be confirmed that when the philosophy of action is taken into\naccount then explanations of participatory art are enhanced.\nThere are many descriptions of aesthetic experience and it is generally assumed\nto be a cornerstone in explanations of art. In one of the leading accounts\naesthetic experience is associated with disinterested perceptions where the\nindividual is free of any practical concern for the object of experience. In recent\nexplanations of contemporary art there is less emphasis on aesthetic experience\nand there is a tendency to suggest that background knowledge and\ninterpretation are equally as significant as perception in the experience of art.\n‘Participatory art’ is a category of art that explicitly demonstrates this state of\naffairs. In contemporary criticism participatory art is a term used to describe art\nthat favours an audience composed of active contributors rather than detached\nviewers. These are artworks that encourage moments of engagement by an\naudience such as the moving of elements in the work or the movement of the\nparticipant’s body. It could be said that the observable actions of participants\nmediate between perception and knowledge in participatory art. Such work\nopens up a space where assumptions made about the experience of art can be\nchallenged.\nThe present study explores how aesthetic experience is affected by the\nintroduction of human action in participatory art by exploring three exhibitions\nof participatory art at The Tate Modern, The Barbican and Dundee\nContemporary Arts. In this study it is suggested that participation in such\nartwork may be a consequence of deliberation, spontaneity or may take place\nwithin a social group. Therefore the aesthetic experiences and actions that are\nidentified in these artworks are examined from the standpoint of reason, the\nbody and social convention through the respective adoption of analytical,\nphenomenological and institutional/sociological perspectives.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wallace, Christopher","Baldacchino, John","Harrison, Dew","Watson, Allan"],"dc:date":"2008-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A critical,\ncontextual review was conducted to assess what kinds of objects are being\nproduced by art and design practitioners; what the significant characteristics of\nthese objects might be; and what technological, theoretical and contextual\nframeworks support their making. A survey of international practitioners was\nundertaken to establish how practitioners use these tools and engage with other\nart and design disciplines. From these a formalised system of analysis was\ndeveloped to derive evaluative criteria for these objects.\nThe researcher developed a curatorial framework for a public exhibition and\nsymposium that explored the direction that art and design practitioners are\ntaking in relation to computer-based tools. These events allowed the researcher\nto survey existing works, explore future trends, gather audience and peer\nresponse and engage the broader community of interest around the field of\nenquiry. Interviews were conducted with practitioners whose work was\nincluded in this exhibition and project stakeholders to reveal patterns and\nthemes relevant to the theoretical framework of this study.\nA model of the phases that practitioners go through when they integrate\ncomputer-based tools into their practice was derived from an existing\ntechnology adoption model. Also, a contemporary version of R. Krauss’s ‘Klein\nGroup’ was developed that considers developments in the field from the use of\ndigital technologies. This was used to model the context within which the\nresearcher’s practice is located. The research identifies a form of ‘technologyled-\npractice’ and an increased capacity for a ‘transdisciplinary discourse’ at the\nintersection of disciplinary domains.

The main conclusions are that women in post-reform China have been educationally and socially disadvantaged compared to men; traditional gender attitudes about women, work and education persist in contemporary China; women are seeking opportunities in international higher education to overcome domestic prejudices; and degree-educated professional women may be developing as a new social class in contemporary Chinese society.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, Yvonne"],"dc:date":"2006","doi":"10.1080/13639080500522986","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"Y Turner.

{"identifier":1576424,"ep:Repository":84,"dc:type":["Conference publication"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Representation and power: Seminar 2, summary: a critical reflection.","bibo:abstract":"The thematic area - Power and Representation emerged in our discussions with Suzanne Lacy as an issue that framed tensions within the Oakland projects\u0027 specifically, as well having relevance beyond Oakland. These tensions included the artist\u0027s role in relation to that of participants as well as the relationship of the artist and participants to hierarchies of value when the work became part of institutional frameworks such as a gallery exhibition. Seminar 2 was an opportunity to explore these issues from two perspectives - that of the artist (Suzanne) and that of the gallery director (Tom Trevor as director of Arnolfini with contributions from Francis McKee, as director of CCA, Glasgow). \n\nAuthority can be viewed as a relationship between those who lead and those who invest in or concede the leadership of others in recognition of their expertise or organisational position. At one point in the discussion it was noted that we tended to associate power as object, as something to accept or reject rather than a process we actively engage in constructing and developing. In this alternative reading, power can be the energy to negotiate authority in different ways and through different forms, energy channelled through different kinds of conduits. The recent curatorial work of Tom at the Arnolfini (such as Recording Iraq April 2007 ) and Suzanne within the Oakland projects (in particular Expectations 1997 , the project at the heart of Seminar 2) reveal a shifting pattern of authority. In writing this reflection I felt the need to go back to first principles and to look at Kaprow\u0027s thinking in the 70s at the point in time when he offered a significant and articulate challenge to institutionalised forms of authority in art  through the notion of the unartist. Kaprow defined the artist\u0027s emergence in public as a source of new energy (and power) in culture that mitigated against the entropy of the establishment. Tom Trevor and Francis McKee acknowledged this entropy within their own experiences of directing galleries and were actively seeking ways of radicalising their respective organisations. \n\nThroughout our discussions in Seminar 2, I had a strong feeling that we were somehow successfully bringing art as experience to the foreground of the discussion (rather than focusing on the different agendas that drive opportunities for art to happen). The tendency in public art is to seek justification in relation to economic, political or social remits. While understanding the relationship of public art to these remits is crucially important, it is also important to remind ourselves of what art \u0027is\u0027 in a specific sense. \n\nIn part this foregrounding occurred in a very \u0027artlike\u0027 way. None of the key contributors were quite where the conventional discourse would have placed them. Suzanne was insistent on her right as an artist to work in galleries if she so chooses.

Tom equally insisted on the possibility of opening up the institution of the gallery as a social space of shared and dynamic meaning making. Francis valued the unique opportunity he had been given at CCA\u0027s point of collapse to redefine the gallery as a project space rather than an exhibition space, to explore and conceptualise the artist in a networked, digital, open source world. \n\nSo our key players framed degrees of uncertainty that kept us thinking.","bibo:AuthorList":["Douglas, Anne"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.466942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.410079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340778,"sim:weight":0.376673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.352058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351681,"sim:weight":0.337572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.326268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.321853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445178,"sim:weight":0.315254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.30555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.304246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998629,"sim:weight":0.296531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.292787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999497,"sim:weight":0.287639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.274781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.262123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.258685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176829,"sim:weight":0.249015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447821,"sim:weight":0.239045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57364,"sim:weight":0.231069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The work of the series therefore set out to create a new level of thinking that would allow art in public to account for its value (not least in relation to significant investment in terms of public funding). \n\nIn experiencing the seminar series and the diversity of positions represented, a new horizon (as Simon Sheikh might put it) has emerged. The focus has shifted towards understanding \u0027quality\u0027 in a different sense - quality as inherent character explored through its interplay with context - artistic, social, cultural and political. \n\nTo focus on criteria for judging quality is to evoke a use or exchange value - What is art for? What is it worth to us (in equivalent monetary terms)? Focusing on quality in the sense of \u0027inherent nature\u0027 raises a different question \u0027What is art? And \u0027What is art in relation to other ways of being in the world?\u0027 What are the (aesthetic and ethical) implications of practising one way or another?\n\nWhen Suzanne Lacy asks of the Oakland projects -\u0027When does this work spill over into becoming life?\u0027, when Grant Kester investigates art projects that propose alternative value systems to those of neoliberalism, or when Simon Sheikh articulates the role of art in terms of constructing diverse publics, they are not constructing an economic justification for art - its use value. They are testing the thresholds that they each perceive between art and other forms of conceptualising and experiencing the world. It is striking in each case how radical these thresholds are.\n\nBy extending our horizon from use value to symbolic experience, the discussion has shifted away from justifying one artistic approach over another. The latter operates within an assumption of art rather than an articulation of art as a practice and its place in the world. It also locks the discourse narrowly into alternative styles of making- gallery or public, allowing the one to be easily dismissed by the other. (Currently in Scotland and further afield this is where most of the heated debate in art is situated.)\n\nI would argue that the real challenge lies in much bigger stakes - of art refinding its place in the world. It is a world in which communication technologies are fluid and shape the everyday in powerful ways. It is a world of significant cultural differences, not least deepening economic discrepancies between the very rich and the very poor. Globally we are increasingly challenged by our relationship with the world. David Haley argues that this is manifest in the significant discourse on climate change (our relationship with the environment) and the discourse on cultural diversity (our relationship with other cultures). We have reached a point in human history that demands that we listen and reflect on the implications of different systems of value; cultural, social and economic. That was the starting point in a particular context of the Oakland series - observing young people and hearing the alarm calls of a breakdown between youth and the adult world.\n\nThe Working in Public discussion has engaged in an open ended exploration of dynamic and radical forms of creativity and their power to create meaning. In so doing it has seriously questioned the intellectual basis for a current hierarchy of values - (such as \u0027art in museums and galleries is more authentically art than art in the public sphere that is compromised by other agendas\u0027). \n\nSeminar 2 questioned whether we can ever assume value in either place - gallery or non gallery. It placed emphasis on continually exercising criticality and gaining a thorough understanding of the power at work in acts of representation (whether in or outside of conventional institutional contexts) and of understanding where authority really lies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Douglas, Anne"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.487732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.416275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.401795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109122,"sim:weight":0.380362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.361876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351681,"sim:weight":0.360773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.340505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.332567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.329995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.326906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.305061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.267544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447821,"sim:weight":0.262538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446414,"sim:weight":0.224289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Moreover, some properties may be sound only within a certain IR model, and some may lead to negative effects to the performance of IR systems. In this paper, by adopting an information-based and abstract framework, model independent, commonsense properties of aboutness are investigated.

This experience started with the PhD project\nby C MacLeod [1] and continued with the work of D McMinn [2] which is due for\nsubmission in June 2001. These are being followed up by the work of research\nstudents A B Reddipogu and N F Capanni.\nInitial work concentrated on Neural Networks that could grow to fulfil their function.\nC MacLeod, in his thesis on this topic, proposed a model of a robotic control system\nto be used as a vehicle for further research. This model formed the basis of D\nMcMinn’s project. The robotic control system [2, 3, 4] has a defined modular\nstructure that enables the researcher to create networks for particular tasks and so\nallow the robot to function. McMinn has used this structure successfully as a basis to\ndevelop Evolutionary ANNs implementing Central Pattern Generators and Reflexes\nfor robot locomotion.\nIt has become apparent, over the course of these projects, that a network that can\nevolve into a modular structure without the need for designed partitioning would be\nthe next step forward for the group’s research. This should allow the network to\ndevelop naturally and in an open-ended way without the need to artificially constrain\nit. Such an approach needs an evolutionary algorithm that can automatically and\nnaturally evolve a “system”: that is, a modular network rather than a fully\ninterconnected homogenous structure. No acceptable Genetic or Evolutionary\nTechniques are currently available to do this. The group therefore needed to look to\nnature and discover the reasons why natural systems allowed such modularity to\nevolve and how it might be exploited in the course of future work.\nIt was felt that this work would be a culmination of the group’s research to date, both\nfurthering the work on robotic control systems and also including ideas from previous\npractical work, by MacLeod and McMinn, in terms of Evolutionary Networks and\nIncremental Evolution (Embryological Algorithms) [1]. This is because such a\nnetwork will need to evolve and to “grow” from a simple to complex structure. The\nresearch and ideas that lay the foundations for this work are contained in this report.\nThe report also considers two related aspects (neural learning and neural function),\nbut as explained above, it is the layout topology or wiring which is felt to be the most\nimportant topic. After all, complex systems may be built up from simple elements,\nsuch as transistors or gates (or indeed, at the most basic level, atoms), providing that\nthey are interconnected in the correct manner.\nTherefore, to summarise: We are concerned with discovering an evolutionary method\ncapable of evolving systems. To establish a method capable of this, we must look again at the action of biological evolution and compare it with current artificial\nevolutionary methods.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacLeod, Christopher","McMinn, David","Reddipogu, Ann","Capanni, Niccolo Francesco","Maxwell, Grant M."],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934499,"sim:weight":0.396376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632062,"sim:weight":0.379315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933695,"sim:weight":0.326995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.322952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934278,"sim:weight":0.321857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.310078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.305523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.297931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.297694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.296363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74643,"sim:weight":0.291246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.283918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.275978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76975,"sim:weight":0.249735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Potential outcomes include the perpetuation and regeneration of core ideological elements. Exposure to narrative is a process of social construction and re-construction that begins in childhood. Yet, entrepreneurship is essentially an adult paradigm. Consequentially, children may be channeled into individual occupations whereby few emerge as entrepreneurs. Unless one is exposed to the power of the entrepreneurial narrative, as a result of familial fables, or by being raised in an entrepreneurial family then by the time one makes a choice to pursue an entrepreneurial career path - life styles and alternative career paths are already established.

It couples low-energy ultraviolet light with semiconductors acting as photocatalyst and thereby overcoming many of the drawbacks that exist for the traditional water treatment methods.  Recent literature has established the potential of this powerful technology to destroy toxic pollutants dissolved or dispersed in water. However, to date, very few viable pilot plants exist using this technology.\n\nIn this study, the application of photocatalysis for the removal of contaminants from waste water discharges such as produced water from oil rigs and other organic contaminants in industrial wastewater, were investigated.  A novel photocatalytic reactor, which employs a commercial pellet titanium dioxide (TiO2) catalyst, was tested for water treatment capability by investigating the photocatalytic degradation of contaminants from waste water discharges such as; hydrocarbons in produced water from the oil industry and synthetic dyes from the textile industry’s waste processing fluids, using titanium dioxide (TiO2) as photocatalyst in an aqueous suspension under UV irradiation.\n\nExperiments were conducted to investigate the effects of parameters such as catalyst loading, pollutant adsorption rate on the pellet TiO2 catalyst and reactor circulation flow rate. In this work, the batch adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous solution (10M) onto the Hombikat-KCO pellet TiO2 catalyst was studied, adsorption isotherms and kinetics were determined from the experimental data. A modest catalyst loading of 30g per 1L TiO2 was choosen for further experiments since its shows gradual and consistent degradation results and approximately 98% degradation of methylene blue was achieved within 60 minutes irradiation in the optimization experiment.\n\nPhotodegradation of methylene blue dye was monitored by UV- spectroscopy.

It presents data about their perceptions of the influence of their studies on their ensuing lives and work. The paper briefly reviews literature about the changing role of education in China, commenting on developments following late twentieth century reforms. It also reflects on the practical management, teaching and learning issues inherent in transnational educational partnerships. The primary research draws on material from a longitudinal study begun in 1998/9 and ongoing. The research data is presented as excerpts from oral histories, where participants discuss their experiences in education and work and the implications of their educational choices on personal identity. The main conclusions are that: the impacts of transnational education on men and women in China may differ; graduates value aspects of the learning experience extrinsic to the subject of study more than disciplinary knowledge over time; structural issues in China affect both the motivation to study on and utility of overseas degrees after graduation; and that the transnational experience impacts on cultural and personal identity in ways that may influence graduates’ integration into the mainstream of Chinese society.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, Yvonne"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This seeming\ninterest in cultural diversity, however, concealed an implicit neo-liberal teleology which\nimplies a convergence hypothesis and change in the cultural role of the nation state to that of\na ‘location manager’, whose role is merely to guarantee favourable conditions for business\nwith the minimum of state intervention.

Existing systems have problems in that they\nrequire a great deal of manual design or are limited to performing jobs of a single\ntype. For these reasons, a better solution is desired.\nThe system studied here is an Artificial Nervous System (ANS) which is\nbiologically inspired; it is arranged as a hierarchy of layers containing modules\noperating in parallel. The ANS model has been developed to be flexible, scalable,\nextensible and modular. The ANS can be implemented using any suitable\ntechnology, for many different environments.\nThe implementation focused on the two lowest layers (the reflex and action\nlayers) of the ANS, which are concerned with control and rhythmic movement.\nBoth layers were realised as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) which were created\nusing Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). The task of the reflex layer was to control the\nposition of an actuator (such as linear actuators or D.C. motors). The action layer\nperformed the task of Central Pattern Generators (CPG), which produce rhythmic\npatterns of activity. In particular, different biped and quadruped gait patterns were\ncreated. An original neural model was specifically developed for assisting in the\ncreation of these time-based patterns.\nIt is shown in the thesis that Artificial Reflexes and CPGs can be configured\nsuccessfully using this technique. The Artificial Reflexes were better at\ngeneralising across different actuators, without changes, than traditional\ncontrollers. Gaits such as pace, trot, gallop and pronk were successfully created\nusing the CPGs. Experiments were conducted to determine whether modularity in\nthe networks had an impact. It has been demonstrated that the degree of\nmodularization in the network influences its evolvability, with more modular\nnetworks evolving more efficiently.","bibo:AuthorList":["McMinn, David","Maxwell, Grant M.","MacLeod, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2001-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86187,"sim:weight":0.310686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85634,"sim:weight":0.286616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86712,"sim:weight":0.26854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84736,"sim:weight":0.265377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.254132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1403069,"sim:weight":0.252898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998446,"sim:weight":0.250563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.246232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18339,"sim:weight":0.243393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87106,"sim:weight":0.23917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.238405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933695,"sim:weight":0.232427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.223714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931240,"sim:weight":0.22106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.219619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934278,"sim:weight":0.219517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.213352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.198907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386706,"sim:weight":0.154325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The interface guides the user through the input process using a series of screens giving options for keywords used to describe the building; comprehensive default data built into the software are then attached to these keywords. The resulting data file is a building description that is the best possible interpretation of the design intent.

Traditionally, Evolutionary Algorithms (Genetic\nAlgorithms, Evolutionary Strategies and Evolutionary Programming) have been used\nto train networks before use - that is “off-line,” as have other learning systems like\nBack-Propagation and Simulated Annealing. However, this means that the network\ncannot react to new situations (which were not in its original training set).\nThe system outlined here uses a Simulated Legged Robot as a test-bed and allows it\nto adapt to a changing Fitness function. An example of this in reality would be a\nrobot walking from a solid surface onto an unknown surface (which might be, for\nexample, rock or sand) while optimising its controlling network in real-time, to\nadjust its locomotive gait, accordingly.\nThe project initially developed a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) for a Bipedal\nRobot and used this to explore the basic characteristics of RTEA. The system was\nthen developed to operate on a Quadruped Robot and a test regime set up which\nprovided thousands of real-environment like situations to test the RTEA’s ability to\ncontrol the robot. The programming for the system was done using Borland C++\nBuilder and no commercial simulation software was used. Through this means, the\nEvolutionary Operators of the RTEA were examined and their real-time performance\nevaluated.\nThe results demonstrate that a RTEA can be used successfully to optimise an ANN\nin real-time. They also show the importance of Neural Functionality and Network\nTopology in such systems and new models of both neurons and networks were\ndeveloped as part of the project. Finally, recommendations for a working system are\ngiven and other applications reviewed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jagadeesan, Ananda Prasanna","Maxwell, Grant M.","MacLeod, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18339,"sim:weight":0.342084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934499,"sim:weight":0.337929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386398,"sim:weight":0.322715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998446,"sim:weight":0.319294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1403069,"sim:weight":0.304644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496425,"sim:weight":0.274477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108624,"sim:weight":0.272951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87106,"sim:weight":0.265974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.258869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.257134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.25182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.23434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932481,"sim:weight":0.224821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98519,"sim:weight":0.220684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.215952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

When a wealthy medieval man or woman donated a statue or painted glass window or altar hanging to their parish church, such a gift would have been prompted by a mixture of motives, including a desire to remind passers-by to pray for their souls and probably a fair amount of self-advertisement. However, it is the contention of this paper that, frequently, the choice of a particular image used in the donation would be selected with careful thought and have its roots in the donor’s particular personal piety. The messages they were thus sending about their personal beliefs may have been instantly readable to their fellow parishioners, but these days require some translation before they can be fully grasped.\nThis paper investigates the spiritual and secular motivations of a family of donors of some unique painted glass windows at All Saints, North Street parish church in York. The windows of the church offer a wealth of unusual later medieval glass, including a depiction of six of the Corporal Acts of Mercy; St Anne teaching the Virgin to read and the northern poem ‘The Prick of Conscience’. This paper will concentrate on exploring one family’s donations to the church. It argues that their choice of iconographic material and the act of donating the windows were part of the donors’ larger concern for maintaining the social fabric. The same concerns were expressed both in charitable acts during their lives and in their last will and testaments. It is suggested that such donations form part of a new and internalised piety and thoughtful charity inspired by more than the customs of the day.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pedersen, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2000-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108450,"sim:weight":0.402003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108171,"sim:weight":0.287015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99226,"sim:weight":0.25219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109081,"sim:weight":0.25103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.244557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90566,"sim:weight":0.232217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85338,"sim:weight":0.231395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225644,"sim:weight":0.205226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58879,"sim:weight":0.202822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108431,"sim:weight":0.193224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109083,"sim:weight":0.192863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Organized crime is a global phenomenon that concentrates upon the development of both [1] Sustainable personal prosperity; and [2] Criminal culture as they define it. Such criminal businesses and the business of criminality go far beyond simple economic and capitalist criteria and entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial ability play a significant part in creating criminal wealth. Indeed it is part of committed criminality. Whilst acknowledging the crime–entrepreneurship nexus the literature seldom seeks to understand entrepreneurial behaviour practiced in a criminal context. This paper therefore examines entrepreneurial behaviour in criminals looking for useful theoretical perspectives and distilling key practices by seeking to understand entrepreneurial behaviour in organised criminals.\nMethodology/Approach: The methodological approach is a qualitative one and relies on cross disciplinary readings of the literatures of crime and entrepreneurship which are developed into a conceptual model for understanding entrepreneurial behaviour in any context. The key behavioural areas which the work concentrates upon are those of modus essendi, modus operandi, and modus vivendi.\nFindings: That crime and entrepreneurship are interconnected areas of human endeavour which both transcend the legal and illegal economies.\nResearch limitations/implications: The research is limited by its tentative and theoretical nature and by the methodology of cross disciplinary reading. Future studies are planned to test the tripartite behavioural model on real cases.\nPractical implications: Viewing entrepreneurship (like criminality) as being a learned method of operating has serious practical implications because it concentrates upon behaviours and actions in specific contexts. Linking this understanding to the related elements of modus vivendi and modus essendi creates a useful model for understanding entrepreneurship in any context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1108/17506200910982019","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.345545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108700,"sim:weight":0.303942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108827,"sim:weight":0.246858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269950,"sim:weight":0.18107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.165818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.160964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.144387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.143732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98865,"sim:weight":0.139304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This influences how female entrepreneurs are perceived in the popular\npress and can be manipulated as an alternative entrepreneurial reality. This work builds\nupon research into entrepreneurial identity introducing the ‘Diva’ concept.\nMethodology/approach: The qualitative methodological approach involves an analysis\nof biographies of famous Diva’s to identify common themes; and an internet trawl to\nidentify supplementary micro–biographies and newspaper articles on ‘Divas’. This\ntripartite approach allows rich data to be collected permitting a comparative analysis.\nFindings: This empirical study presents the socially constructed nature of entrepreneurial\nnarrative and the ‘Diva storyline’ demonstrating the influence of journalistic licence upon\nhow successful women are portrayed. The study adds incremental credence to power of\nmale dominated journalistic practices to vilify enterprising behaviour to sell newspapers.\nResearch limitations/implications: An obvious limitation to the work is that the sample\nof articles and biographies selected were chosen via search parameters which mention the\nword ‘Diva’. Nevertheless, there is scope for further ‘more detailed’ research into the\nphenomenon to flesh out the model built in this preliminary paper.\nPractical implications: An important implication for scholars and journalists is the need\nto reconsider how we tell and decode entrepreneur stories. As researchers we need to\nrecognise that there are other avenues for women to become entrepreneurs than to\nbecome businesswomen and that it is alright for women to reject the ‘entrepreneur’ label.\nOriginality/value: This paper informs our understanding of the socially constructed\nnature of how we tell, understand and appreciate entrepreneur stories. It thus makes a\nunique contribution by illustrating that the storylines which constitute the ‘Diva Cycle’\nare constructed from the same storylines that we associate with entrepreneur stories but\nnarrated in a different order. It provides another heuristic device for understanding the\nsocial construction of gendered entrepreneurial identities making it of interest to feminist\nscholars of entrepreneurship and to social constructionists alike.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1108/17566260910969698","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.346984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.239534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.227278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108223,"sim:weight":0.225894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.21553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.21295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.206627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.192969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.179104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The gist of the paper is that travelling people can (and deserve) to be viewed as an entrepreneurial people because epistemologically and ontologically there is congruence between the entrepreneurial traits and entrepreneurial narratives of Travellers and the settled people of their native Scotland.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1504/IJBG.2009.023497","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":78387,"sim:weight":0.344331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58828,"sim:weight":0.274793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160376,"sim:weight":0.225634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.178148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108504,"sim:weight":0.1739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160595,"sim:weight":0.142107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.129803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270152,"sim:weight":0.129055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Introducing\nthe concepts of ‘context’, ‘artist-led’ and ‘residency’ with reference to the\nArtists Placement Group, the problematics of assessing the social\ncontribution of context-specific art practices are presented as resting upon\ntwo difficulties, the conceptual gulf between the artworld and the public\nrealm and the assumption that artists can or should not articulate their\nintentions for an artwork.\nCombining questions raised from practice with the problems outlined by\nSuzanne Lacy, the need for research into the generative process of public\nartists is established. The purpose of the research is to investigate and\ndevelop artists’ understanding of the generative process by examining the\ninteraction of artists in contexts in the public realm and to make that\ninformation explicit. An appropriate methodology and theoretical\nframework is found by critically reviewing recent related practice-based\nresearch projects in Art and Design with special attention to the work of\nIan Hunter on immersion strategies in rural contexts. The model of the\nartistic process as problem-solving, developed by J. Getzels and M.\nCsikszentmihalyi , is also examined against current theories in scientific\nresearch into creativity and theories of social policy problem-setting of\nDonald Schon and the pattern of inquiry by John Dewey and subsequently\nextended. Data was generated by recording the decisions and reflections of\nthree artists carrying out an actual artist-led context-specific project in the\npublic realm (‘Taming Goliath’). Data gathered by using a specially adapted\nmethod (‘Sweatbox’) were analysed by using the Generative Process Model.\nThe results produced narratives which describe each artist’s experience and\ninformation on the methods artists use to interact with a context in the\npublic realm, their intentions. The significance of the findings and the\nexperience are discussed in relation to the work of Suzanne Lacy and Allan\nKaprow with recommendations for further research. In conclusion, four\nareas contributing to knowledge are proposed: the extension of the\nGenerative Process Model, the development of an methodology of analysis,\nthe usage of the Sweatbox method and contributions to the body of\nknowledge of artists’ processes in the public realm.","bibo:AuthorList":["Silver, Susannah","Berry, John","Bianchini, Franco","Douglas, Anne","Baxter, Seaton"],"dc:date":"1999-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2744516,"sim:weight":0.347935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.336715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351671,"sim:weight":0.319615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.272453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.248861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.241649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98643,"sim:weight":0.221594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.207692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.183546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":1576502,"ep:Repository":84,"dc:type":["Thesis or dissertation","Masters","MRes"],"bibo:shortTitle":"From Alice to BlueJ: a transition to Java","bibo:abstract":"The teaching of introductory courses in computing has seen several changes over the last decade. These changes not only affected the curricula when the emphasis was shifted from Imperative (also Procedural) to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) but also reignited debates regarding which is the better programming language. Furthermore, the shift in emphasis also has encountered challenges with the object-oriented pedagogy. More recently, the assessment procedure for how students are learning object-oriented concepts has been given attention.\nWhen the programming language Java was adopted to teach object-oriented programming, it was not without difficulties. Various studies cited the development environment for Java, which was designed for professional programmers and its complex syntax structures as the main source of Java’s difficulties (Kolling \u0026 Rosenberg 2001).\nThe studies were not only limited to identifying the problems of teaching and learning Java but they also identified solutions. One of these included the creation of programming tools and environment to help novice programmers learn object-oriented concepts effectively. Among the integrated development environments created for teaching object-oriented programming using Java is BlueJ. Another programming tool for teaching object-oriented programming is Alice. The technology of animated program visualization keeps the focus on objects while teaching about behaviour and state (Dann et al 2003).\nThe study concerns how the different programming tools help students in learning object-oriented concepts. One is classified as a text-based tool, BlueJ, and the other is graphical-based tool, Alice. There are three main questions for this study:\n1.\nDoes the process of learning object-oriented concepts using graphical-based tools differ from using text-based tools?\n2.\nDo graphical-based tools support text-based tools in learning object-oriented concepts?\n3.\nDo graphical-based tools offer more help in understanding object-oriented concepts than text-based tools?\nTo answer the questions, the researcher conducted a survey whereby two sets of questionnaires were distributed to the students of Robert Gordon module entitled Object-Oriented Programming Techniques (CM1011). The student respondents found significant difference in the use of the graphical-based and text-based programming tools in understanding the following object-oriented concepts: Message Passing, Encapsulation and Polymorphism. The data gathered were also indicative that a graphical-based programming tool like Alice is helpful in learning object-oriented concepts with the use of a text-based programming tool like BlueJ. Whether graphical tools like Alice help more in understanding object-oriented concepts than text-based tools like BlueJ was inconclusive. The initial study suggests that there was no significant difference with students’ confidence in learning the various object-oriented concepts using the programming tools. The student respondents appeared to recognise that both programming tools are useful in learning various object-oriented concepts. However, it seems that they expected Alice to be a more sophisticated animation tool and that the animations produced would be of a cinematic calibre.\nThe study aspires to contribute to the improvement of the object-oriented pedagogy. Specifically, it aims to contribute in the development of teaching methodologies for object-oriented programming and then create learning strategies for object-oriented programming and, not to forget, make the assessment of object-oriented programming more effective and suitable. Alongside the improvement of object-oriented programming pedagogy, the study also tries to make the computing course curricula more appropriate and flexible with the use of the various programming tools.\nSuggestions on how the study can be made more rigorous have been listed including use of additional data gathering instruments and methodology. Also, recommendations on how else the questions can be written were incorporated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rey, Jeanette S.","Watt, Stuart","Brindley, Garry","Eccleston, Gordon","McDermott, Roger"],"dc:date":"2009-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23657,"sim:weight":0.329789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84837,"sim:weight":0.30013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109174,"sim:weight":0.29462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631521,"sim:weight":0.293796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.253308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.253158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.245144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.243717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.243065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.242945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.241597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.238728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76053,"sim:weight":0.223535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.219873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.216248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.214455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.214291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85548,"sim:weight":0.207372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.199116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.190419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It proposes a number of vision\nsystems based on detection of straight lines in images captured by a robot using\nthe Hough transform and artificial neural networks as core algorithms. The Hough\ntransform is a robust method for detection of basic features (Boyce et al 1987).\nHowever, it is so computationally demanding that it is not commonly used in real\ntime applications and applications which utilise anything but small images (Song\nand Lyu 2005). (Dempsey and McVey 1992) have suggested that this problem\nmight be resolved if the Hough transform were implemented with artificial neural\nnetworks. This project investigates the feasibility of systems using these core\nalgorithms, and systems that are hybrids of them.\nPrior to application of the core algorithms to a captured image, various stages of\npre-processing are carried out including resizing for optimum results, edgedetection,\nand edge thinning using an adaptation of the thinning method of (Park,\n2000) proposed by this work. An analysis of the costs and benefits of thinning as\npart of pre-processing has also been performed.\nThe Hough transform based system, which has been largely successful, has\ninvolved a number of new approaches. These include a peak detection scheme;\npost-processing schemes which find valid sub-lines of lines found by the peak\ndetection process, and establish which high-level features these sub-lines\nrepresent; and an appropriate navigation scheme.\nTwo artificial neural network systems were designed based on lines detection and\nsub-lines detection respectively. The first was able to detect long lines, but not\nshorter (even though navigationally important) lines, and so was aborted. The\nsecond system has two major stages. Networks of stage 1 developed to detect\nsub-lines in sub-images derived by breaking down the original images, did so\npassibly well. A network in stage 2 designed to use the results of stage 1 to guide\nthe robot’s motion did not do so well for most test images. The networks of stage\n1, however, have been helpful with development of a hybrid vision system.\nSuggestions have been made on how this work can be furthered.","bibo:AuthorList":["Damaryam, Gideon Kanji","Dunbar, Graeme","Aust, Chris","Maxwell, Grant M."],"dc:date":"2008-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8998976,"sim:weight":0.285113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269940,"sim:weight":0.281983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20346,"sim:weight":0.28067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56544,"sim:weight":0.24991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.247624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147453,"sim:weight":0.244771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934910,"sim:weight":0.230822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933744,"sim:weight":0.230134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653040,"sim:weight":0.230048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934481,"sim:weight":0.227649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98583,"sim:weight":0.222987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.208339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.203779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.203752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98450,"sim:weight":0.200104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.194594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998010,"sim:weight":0.179314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A qualitative, interpretive methodology was used. The interviews probed how upward communication was transmitted and investigated how ingratiation theory and impression management dynamics could impact on it by exploring the story telling (Gabriel, 200) and sense making approaches (Weick, 1995) employed by interviewees.\nThe data was then tabulated on Excel sheets, using the Framework Analysis (Swallow et al., 2002), thus establishing an easily referenced, perfectly structured database. Finally, the data was sifted, perused, distilled and analysed interpretively.\nIt was found that upward communication was shaped by processes such as downsizing, management and leadership styles, the power dynamics of the organisation, issues of publicness, and the perceived physical and psychological distance of the superior from the subordinate. \nFinally, the components of opinion conformity (a factor common to ingratiation theory and impression management), employee silence (Morrison and Milliken, 2000, Milliken, 2003), and cynicism (Fleming and Spicer, 2002; Naus, 2004, 2007) were identified as the most significant syndromes that impacted on the levels of upward communication within the four organisations. Hence, a Conformity/Silence/Cynicism model of upward communication (the CSC model) was devised as a means of illustrating the significance of the most important stimuli of upward communication that the study revealed.\nThe issues raised in this study are fundamental to the theory and practice of management. Openness in the search for solutions to organisational problems is central to organisational learning. The creation of an organisational environment in which this is possible is therefore vital.

Perceived secularisation of contemporary British society, together with increasing competition from ‘New Age’ movements, is causing many churches to review their approach to mission. This study considers the impact of the Scottish Episcopal Church’s strategy, Mission 21, during 1999-2004, initially under the controversial leadership of Primus Richard Holloway. Its explicit aim was to create a ‘postmodern’ church, attractive to those ‘on the margins of faith’.\n\nThe research discovered that managerial and sociological approaches alone are insufficient to understand meaning and change in organisations, and that unique insights into the cultural change process may be gained from understanding of psychological individual differences, both of organisations and their members. In this case the instrument used was the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and derived Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KTS). A case study approach was adopted to develop theory grounded in the data, collected from grass roots congregations in the shape of MBTI profiles of clergy and key players, and a repertory grid analysis of the clergy role; and at strategic level with a participant observation study.\n\nClergy were expected to be spiritual enactors of worship, leaders and managers of resources, and, most importantly for congregational key stakeholders of all personality types, to minister to congregations’ emotional needs. This tended to inhibit their ability to drive through culture change. The Church’s culture appeared predominantly traditionalist, although there was also evidence of a more liberal and mystical strain. However, the aim by Holloway to attract the interest of ultra-liberals was seen to extend the Church’s ‘market niche’ further than could be sustained even in a relatively heterogeneous culture. The research indicated that change in a faith-based organisation, concerned with people’s deepest emotions and anxieties, cannot ignore individual differences at the expense of managerial factors when understanding of the former provides a unique insight into the change process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Mary Louise","Gourlay, Douglas","Smart, Peter John","Hannabuss, C.

Three areas are discussed; gift giving, the methodological approach and the results and conclusions.\nGift giving is an historical concept relating to exchanges of gifts representing many symbols and meanings. Toys are often given to children at birthdays and Christmas and the perception of the gift giver may be affected by many things. The long-term impact may alter the relationship between the child and parent. Miscommunication is often cited as being an influence on the level of disappointment that may occur.\nFour drawing sessions were conducted with preschool children from two nurseries. The aim of these sessions was to identify what the children’s favourite toy gift was at Christmas and birthday time, who had given it to them and what they thought of the giver.\nThe pictorial results were coded and results concluded that almost all the children could identify their favourite toy gifts. A majority were satisfied with their gifts and most surprisingly identified Santa as the gift giver for Birthday toys as well as Christmas.

The regulatory bodies had to accept the changing risk nature of the industry\nand the response was the introduction of the 1996 Market Risk Amendment (MRA)\nby the Basle Committee. The MRA, through a series of 4 key announcements, was\nreached in January 1996 and fully implemented from January 1997, whereby banks\nwere required to hold incremental capital to cover unexpected losses from market\nrisk. In this study a multivariate regression model is used to investigate the effect of\nthe MRA announcements on the returns to shareholders of commercial banks within\nG-10 countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The empirical results\nsuggest that bank shareholders in Italy, Sweden, and especially Japan benefited from\nthe introduction of the MRA, while bank shareholders in the United Kingdom,\nCanada, and especially US experienced significant losses from 4 announcements that\nled to the final proposal of the 1996 MRA.\nThe significant growth in income generated through OBS activities, such as trading\nand fee-based income, changed the risk profile financial institutions. This study\nemploys four VaR methodologies (parametric, historical simulation, Monte Carlo\nsimulation, and Extreme Value Theory) to calculate bank risk in a period of high\n4\nfinancial market volatility: 1992 through to 1998. The results show a strong increase\nin VaR for the years 1997 and 1998, with Japan showing the largest risk ranking over\nthe period, while the US and Sweden were at the low end of the risk range. The VaR\nresults indicate it may be misleading to compare risk scores across financial\ninstitutions if the reported numbers are based on different VaR methodologies. The\nresults from the Monte Carlo (MC) and Extreme Value Theory (EVT) approaches\nresult in the highest VaR estimates, while the parametric results were consistently\nlower.\nThis thesis also employed Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to compute bank-level\ntechnical efficiency under Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) and Variable Returns to\nScale (VRS) between 1992 and 1998. The results for the entire bank sample across\nthe period of study show inefficiency levels of 39% and 33%, under CRS and VRS\nrespectively. The inclusion of off-balance sheet (OBS) activity in the DEA score is\nfound to be significant, and indicate that the exclusion of this variable as an output\nleads to a misspecification and underestimation of bank efficiency. A Tobit regression\napproach was used to examine the relationship between bank efficiency and various\nbank and environmental variables. The second stage findings show that inflation is\ndetrimental to bank efficiency, while a negative relationship is found between VaR\nand efficiency, indicating inefficient banks appear to take on less risk. A positive\nrelationship is found between the MRA dummy variable and bank efficiency.","bibo:AuthorList":["Forsyth, Michael","Raj, Mahendra","Jones, Pete","Weir, Charlie"],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1493910,"sim:weight":0.417056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108782,"sim:weight":0.415931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573405,"sim:weight":0.406049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108941,"sim:weight":0.372625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91276,"sim:weight":0.307367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1038402,"sim:weight":0.291258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99139,"sim:weight":0.278772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.266947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186607,"sim:weight":0.255795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25977,"sim:weight":0.209838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573447,"sim:weight":0.18806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186343,"sim:weight":0.185061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85650,"sim:weight":0.158888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Market mechanisms have increasingly been employed in an attempt to overcome the problem of underdevelopment such as low growth and poverty; however the implementation of market centred policies has raised other problems such as institutional mechanisms and the quality of governance within the institutions designed to implement the market oriented policies. This thesis attempts to throw some light on these problems by investigating the case of liberalisation in the Kenyan coffee industry. The thesis concentrates on the question of the extent to which the liberalisation program sponsored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Government of Kenya (GOK) has been effective in creating an efficiently functioning market within the coffee sector in particular and the Kenyan macro-economy in general.\nThe research finds that on the whole the liberalisation program targeted at the coffee sector has failed to take into account the institutional conditions and the extent of state centred features like rent seeking and centralised decision makings powers within the coffee sector prior to implementing the liberalisation program. The resulting market arrangement has therefore adversely affected the program’s intended recipients, particularly at the level of cooperative institution where the interests of the small-scale farmers are represented. The thesis will elaborate more on this and relate its findings to the macro-economic view of Kenya.\nThe conclusion shows that in order for the Kenyan economy to break free from the problems of underdevelopment and to generate sustainable rates of growth, more attention must be given to improving the quality of governance and to developing a credible set of institutions to support and execute market-friendly economic policies. Good quality governance represented by accountability, transparency, rule of law, stability and efficiency appears to be the missing ingredient in making Kenya a successful economy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Varqa, Sathia","Coram, Alex","Bonney, Norman"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.309238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154447,"sim:weight":0.260364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60158,"sim:weight":0.241309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108670,"sim:weight":0.224021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227019,"sim:weight":0.210141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.2032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85356,"sim:weight":0.183091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study adopts a three-step process to achieve these\nobjectives. The first step involves elaborating on the lack of coherence and\nintegrity in the imputation of acts and intents (or causal relationships) to\ncorporations caused by a disjunction of rules invoked by courts. The second\nstep involves establishing parameters by which mechanisms of imputation\nmay be evaluated. The third step involves evaluating a number of samples by\nreference to the established parameters. Five mechanisms of imputation\napplicable in the United Kingdom and in some jurisdictions that trace their\nlegal heritage to the United Kingdom are evaluated.\nIn the conclusion, it is submitted that although none of the mechanisms\nevaluated may be deemed to be the appropriate mechanism, the aggregation\ndoctrine is the least inappropriate. This is because although it requires some\nmodification, it can best be aligned with propositions of how the criminal\nliability of corporations may be established on a coherent and consistent\nbasis. The propositions that are put forward include the use of the doctrine of\ninnocent agency to establish a corporation’s guilt in instances where no guilty\nagent may be identified; and the use of the principle of accessorial liability to\nestablish a corporation’s guilt in instances where a guilty agent may be\nidentified. The aggregation doctrine as modified in this study will enable the\nprosecutor to establish a corporation’s guilt as advised above if measurable\nvalues are given to the ‘innocent’ acts of agents and if emphasis is placed on\nhow the corporation reacted to the discursive dilemma that arose in the\ndecision-making process that preceded the performance of the relevant\nactivity. This will provide evidence to the effect that the aggregated act\nrepresents the corporation’s subjective position.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nana, Constantine Ntsanyu","Christie, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85570,"sim:weight":0.245005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108643,"sim:weight":0.242845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929884,"sim:weight":0.231144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108926,"sim:weight":0.225842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99223,"sim:weight":0.224991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.222615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99396,"sim:weight":0.221828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99043,"sim:weight":0.220404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269950,"sim:weight":0.220015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.218613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99009,"sim:weight":0.216429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316357,"sim:weight":0.214184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84868,"sim:weight":0.20876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99235,"sim:weight":0.201937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26473,"sim:weight":0.200546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85815,"sim:weight":0.191168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185136,"sim:weight":0.187277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, these have not\ncontrasted or discriminated young carers\u0027 experiences according to different\nparental conditions. To address this gap in knowledge, the current study\nconsidered the experiences of young carers supporting parents with different\n`types\u0027 of conditions, namely physical disability, mental health problems and\nsubstance misuse. The participants discussed the impact of caring on a range of\nareas such as their education, social life, health, spatial transitions, relationships\nand role reversals. Additionally, definitional issues were considered. This\nincluded young carers own understanding and subscription to the term `young\ncarer\u0027 and the significance of this to their identification.\nIn terms of methodology, the study was firmly grounded within the qualitative\ndomain and influenced by a constructive-interpretive paradigm, specifically\nsymbolic interactionism. Within this, the grounded theory approach was used\ninsofar as it provided a method to conduct the study. A range of data-collection\ntechniques were employed. Semi-structured interviewing was the principal\nmethod used, with additional data gathered through a self-esteem tool,\nobservations and diaries. The sample consisted of 30 young carers.\nThe results showed firstly that the participants did not necessarily comprehend the\nterm `young carer\u0027 or apply it to their own caring roles at home. Arguably, this\ncontributed to their `hidden-ness\u0027 (i. e. invisibility) and as a result their needs were\noverlooked. The need for a new definition which embraces their understandings,\ntogether with appropriate awareness-raising programmes within schools and for\nkey social care and health professionals was evidenced and called for. Secondly,\nwhilst the participants shared common experiences regardless of the nature of the\nparental condition, other issues reported were specific to particular situations.\nThose most adversely affected were caring in the contexts of parental substance\nmisuse or parental mental health problems. Such young carers were dually\ndisadvantaged, as they experienced the most extreme difficulties, yet their caring\nroles and needs were least likely to be addressed.\nThe experiential differences reported by young carers in different caring contexts\nhave important practice implications. Nevertheless, the extent to which the\nexperiences reported could be wholly attributed to the caring role, rather than\nother structural and socio-economic factors was questionable.","bibo:AuthorList":["Christie, Emma","Love, John","Bell, Julian"],"dc:date":"2006-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.448419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.369653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.323779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158609,"sim:weight":0.30845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156755,"sim:weight":0.300216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.271868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316190,"sim:weight":0.249704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.249226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154825,"sim:weight":0.24782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.240224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.234937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.229595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99496,"sim:weight":0.226887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.226351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.221167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.216307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.20752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316186,"sim:weight":0.191101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Invariably it has to\nacknowledge the very qualities of art that it seeks to explain - art’s\nelusiveness and its indeterminateness. On the other hand, it is the nature\nof art to philosophise within itself, about itself, and about the world. In\nthis sense it operates as tacit philosophy.\nThe language of art and the language of philosophy differ in form; but\nrecent turns in philosophy have led to the expression of its truth in terms\nthat transcend language and question its own epistemic structure. At the\nsame time, art has always acknowledged its approach to ‘truth’ and\n‘knowledge’ as being ‘other’ to that epistemology.\nThis ‘otherness’ to traditional ways of knowing is recognised in\nphilosophical discourse as ‘alterity’. The thesis posits that in art alterity\nhas always been, and remains, tacit and integral to art’s being. Thus, by\nexploring the ways in which – through alterity – art and philosophy\nintersect and interweave, the thesis aims to reveal a new kind of\nknowledge that transcends the rational and the empirical but is\nnonetheless not only valid, but of the very highest integrity.

The content of the case knowledge container is critical to the performance of case-based classification systems. However, the knowledge engineer is given little support in the selection of suitable techniques to maintain and monitor the case base. This research investigates the coverage, competence and problem-solving capacity of case knowledge with the aim of developing techniques to model and maintain the case base.\nWe present a novel technique that creates a model of the case base by measuring the uncertainty in local areas of the problem space based on the local mix of solutions present. The model provides an insight into the structure of a case base by means of a complexity profile that can assist maintenance decision-making and provide a benchmark to assess future changes to the case base.\nThe distribution of cases in the case base is critical to the performance of a case-based reasoning system. We argue that classification boundaries represent important regions of the problem space and develop two complexity-guided algorithms which use boundary identification techniques to actively discover cases close to boundaries. We introduce a complexity-guided redundancy reduction algorithm which uses a case complexity threshold to retain cases close to boundaries and delete cases that form single class clusters. The algorithm offers control over the balance between maintaining competence and reducing case base size.\nThe performance of a case-based reasoning system relies on the integrity of its case base but in real life applications the available data invariably contains erroneous, noisy cases. Automated removal of these noisy cases can improve system accuracy. In addition, error rates can often be reduced by removing cases to give smoother decision boundaries between classes. We show that the optimal level of boundary smoothing is domain dependent and, therefore, our approach to error reduction reacts to the characteristics of the domain by setting an appropriate level of smoothing. We introduce a novel algorithm which identifies and removes both noisy and boundary cases with the aid of a local distance ratio.\nA prototype interface has been developed that shows how the modelling and maintenance approaches can be used in practice in an interactive manner. The interface allows the knowledge engineer to make informed maintenance choices without the need for extensive evaluation effort while, at the same time, retaining control over the process. One of the strengths of our approach is in applying a consistent, integrated method to case base maintenance to provide a transparent process that gives a degree of explanation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Massie, Stewart","Craw, Susan","Wiratunga, Nirmalie"],"dc:date":"2006-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.283061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.273324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.272695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.26757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61040,"sim:weight":0.261236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.258812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98644,"sim:weight":0.251922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.242155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.229974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930463,"sim:weight":0.228159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.146468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Over the past thirty years, the\ncritical interventions of feminist art historians in the academy, the press\nand the art world have not only politicised and transformed the themes,\nmethods and conceptual tools of art history, but have also contributed to\nthe emergence of new interdisciplinary areas of investigation, including\nnotably that of visual culture. Although the impact of such fruitful\ntransformations is indisputable, their exact contribution to contemporary\nscholarship and their changing function within the academy remains a\nmatter for debate, not least because feminism itself has changed\nsignificantly since the Women’s Liberation Movement. Side-stepping\nfacile, vague and/or ideologically suspect formulations like “postfeminism”,\nthis collection targets the relationships between past and\npresent as well as among different strands of thought; it aims to offer a\ncomplex re-evaluation of different strands in feminist thought and practice\naround art and visual culture since the 1970s, highlighting continuities as\nwell as points of disjunction. The essays in this volume, all previously\nunpublished, engage with the interpretative and conceptual models\nfashioned by feminist art history and visual cultural criticism from both\nhistorical and theoretical perspectives. The authors, most of whom are\nearly career academics and emergent practising artists, explore the gaps\nand omissions of established methodologies and prevalent art historical\nnarratives, while also recovering valuable tools and insights that may be\nredeployed in contemporary contexts and put to new uses. Inspired by the\none-day conference Difference Reframed: Reflections on the Legacies of\nFeminist Art History and Visual Culture (16 September 2006, University of Sussex),1 this is a purposeful selection of considered responses to what\nthe authors view as timely and pressing questions, including: What is the\nrelevance of feminist art history to contemporary scholarship, curating,\nand art practice? If feminism itself works through/as revision, should\nsecond-wave strategies and concerns be further (or newly) revised? What\nhas been the influence of feminist theory—and practice—on key notions\nlike spectatorship, subjectivity, and performativity? Does theory have a\nhistory (and vice versa)?

We suggest that while these modes of\norganisation may initially seek to curb entrepreneurial excess, in time, they have the potential\nto be abused, and thus, in themselves, become a form of excess.","bibo:AuthorList":["Warren, Lorraine","Smith, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.237229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.172223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340689,"sim:weight":0.171269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98658,"sim:weight":0.16847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447847,"sim:weight":0.160295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.154992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447316,"sim:weight":0.147929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.146144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.140605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186292,"sim:weight":0.129976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The presence of these compounds in water has resulted in the death of both humans and domestic and wild animals. Although microcystins are chemically stable titanium dioxide photocatalysis has proven to be an effective process for the removal of these compounds in water. One problem with this process is that it requires UV light and therefore in order to develop effective commercial reactor units that could be powered by solar light it is necessary to utilize a photocatalyst that is active with visible light. In this paper we report on the application of four visible light absorbing photocatalysts for the destruction of microcystin-LR in water. The rhodium doped material proved to be the most effective material followed by a carbon-modified titania. The commercially available materials were both relatively poor photocatalysts under visible radiation while the platinum doped catalyst also displayed a limited activity for toxin destruction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Graham, Douglas J.

Measurement of the changes, over several time integrals, in the Raman and anti-stokes Raman of TiO2 spectra with exposure to laser radiation is reported. Raman and anti-stokes Raman provide detail on both the structure and the kinetic process of changes in crystalline phases in the titania material. The effect of laser exposure resulted in the generation of increasing amounts of the rutile crystalline phase from the anatase crystalline phase during exposure. The Raman spectra displayed bands at 144 cm−1 (A1g), 197 cm−1 (Eg), 398 cm−1 (B1g), 515 cm−1 (A1g), and 640 cm−1 (Eg) assigned to anatase which were replaced by bands at 143 cm−1 (B1g), 235 cm−1 (2 phonon process), 448 cm−1 (Eg) and 612 cm−1 (A1g) which were assigned to rutile. This indicated that laser irradiation of TiO2 changes the crystalline phase from anatase to rutile. Raman and anti-stokes Raman are highly sensitive to the crystalline forms of TiO2 and allow characterisation of the effect of laser irradiation upon TiO2. This technique would also be applicable as an in situ method for monitoring changes during the laser irradiation process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rigby, Stephanie J.","Al-Obaidi, Ala H.

The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 has been shown to depend upon many criteria including the ratio of anatase/rutile crystal phase, particle size and oxidation state. This paper reports the use of optical surface second harmonic generation (SSHG) to monitor modifications in TiO2 powder induced following laser treatment. SSHG is a non-contact, non-destructive technique, which is highly sensitive to both surface chemical and physical changes.

Thus, agents solve the overall problem by finding a solution to their complex local problem which is compatible with the solutions proposed by other agents for their own local problems. Several approaches to solving DisCSPs have been devised and can be classified as systematic search and local search techniques. We present Multi-Hyb, a two-phase hybrid algorithm for solving coarse-grained DisCSPs which uses both systematic and local search during problem solving. Phase 1 generates key partial solutions to the global problem using systematic search. Concurrently, a penalty-based local search algorithm attempts to find a global solution to the problem using these partial solutions. If a global solution is not found in phase 1, the information learnt from phase 1 is used to inform the search carried out during the next phase. Phase two runs a systematic search algorithm on complex variables guided by the following knowledge obtained in phase 1: (i) partial solutions and; (ii) complex local problems which appear more difficult to satisfy. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that Multi-Hyb is competitive in several problem classes in terms of: (i) the communication cost and (ii) the computational effort needed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, David","Arana, Ines","Ahriz, Hatem","Hui, Kit-Ying"],"dc:date":"2009-09","doi":"10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.181","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1576339,"sim:weight":0.564367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931954,"sim:weight":0.382681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.328296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98526,"sim:weight":0.315207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932361,"sim:weight":0.313292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931690,"sim:weight":0.298363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98569,"sim:weight":0.286434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5849382,"sim:weight":0.282837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28021,"sim:weight":0.281976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998967,"sim:weight":0.269263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931792,"sim:weight":0.266406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26006,"sim:weight":0.2443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998017,"sim:weight":0.242313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931813,"sim:weight":0.238392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98723,"sim:weight":0.225747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997844,"sim:weight":0.207242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934037,"sim:weight":0.189257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.17529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98712,"sim:weight":0.166812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933069,"sim:weight":0.164748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Areas of difficulty range from the question of when the issue should be left to the jury, to the relevance of the defence to battered women who kill. The issue for consideration here will be the ‘reasonable’ or ‘ordinary man’ and the characteristics imputed to him in the light of the accused’s own character. R. v. Smith  reaffirms the Court of Appeal’s view that the accused’s characteristics should be included at all levels of the test. Attitudes to this differ considerably. On the one hand, some argue that the doctrine weakens the legal requirement of self-control and is therefore only acceptable where the accused has been pushed to extremes. This is ensured by maintaining a highly objective approach and narrow interpretation of the ‘reasonable man’. On the other hand, it is argued that, in the interests of attaining justice, characteristics of the accused should be imputed to the reasonable man in order to acknowledge that some people will find conduct more provoking than others, and that some individuals may have a lower threshold of self-restraint which should be taken into account. This article considers the merits of these two approaches by analysing recent English case law and contrasting this with Australian developments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Christie, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2000-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1448021,"sim:weight":0.462106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176848,"sim:weight":0.367465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1422261,"sim:weight":0.337309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99396,"sim:weight":0.332671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27048,"sim:weight":0.319934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.297533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85570,"sim:weight":0.289495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162956,"sim:weight":0.276424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99009,"sim:weight":0.261928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176810,"sim:weight":0.254891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316062,"sim:weight":0.253683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.249428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84868,"sim:weight":0.246353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89935,"sim:weight":0.244519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.24104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58704,"sim:weight":0.240721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269950,"sim:weight":0.237992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85815,"sim:weight":0.23453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99223,"sim:weight":0.230027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99235,"sim:weight":0.204678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It can often be crucial to a criminal case to unequivocally identify the body fluid source of DNA. This is of particular importance in rape cases where the defence may argue that the source of a female DNA profile might be from a casual touch or from saliva.\nIn this study, proteomics has been employed in an attempt to identify potential biomarkers that are specific to a range of body fluids. Many publications cite the use of proteomics to identify biomarkers of disease such as cancer. In these reports, diseased and healthy tissues or tissues that have been treated or not treated with a drug are compared and the expressed proteins are compared by 2D electrophoresis. Human body fluids differ in function, composition and protein expression. Proteomics therefore seemed an ideal application to isolate the proteins that are characteristic of and specific to, different fluid types.\nBoth saliva and vaginal fluid proteomic methodologies were optimised for sample preparation, IPG strip pH range and protein load, and post-electrophoretic staining.\nSeventeen isolated protein spots from saliva and vaginal fluid samples were submitted for LC-MS/MS analysis. Nine saliva spots and eleven vaginal spots were identified as known proteins on the MASCOT database. Of those thought to be specific to saliva or vaginal fluid six candidate biomarkers were tested further against a panel of body fluids for specificity using ELISA or Dot Blot.\nZinc-α-2 glycoprotein (ZA2G) was detected and present in all body fluid samples thus could be used as a human body fluid positive control in a future assay. SCC (Squamous cell carcinoma) ELISA was capable of distinguishing samples of vaginal origin by detection of SCCA (Squamous cell carcinoma antigen). This antigen could be used in conjunction with a menstrual blood marker to distinguish between vaginal fluid and menstrual blood. Antibody specificity was a limiting factor in the success of the dot blots performed and hence the analysis of Cystatin SA, Cystatin SN and SERPIN B1 was inconclusive.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vincini, Louisa","Kong, Paul Thoo Lin","McIntosh, Lesley","Wilson, Theresa"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631765,"sim:weight":0.279417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.23564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643950,"sim:weight":0.220524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75419,"sim:weight":0.214189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.212966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929888,"sim:weight":0.181327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222812,"sim:weight":0.179612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931557,"sim:weight":0.176286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76821,"sim:weight":0.176016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98860,"sim:weight":0.162737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.161198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340563,"sim:weight":0.160645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.157088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.156121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26717,"sim:weight":0.153078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77174,"sim:weight":0.14482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76866,"sim:weight":0.141594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.1397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98882,"sim:weight":0.136396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.136138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To enable analysis of a large number\nof water samples to be carried out within an accepted timeframe, Colilert 18™ was\nvalidated for the detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in potable water\nand was compared to the accepted standard method, membrane filtration. Colilert\n18™ was further validated for use with soil samples to allow the study of factors\naffecting coliform survival in water and soil to be carried out.

The\ntransport of coliform bacteria in soil was investigated using repacked and\nundisturbed soil columns, with transport enhanced by rainfall. However even with\nheavy rainfall coliform bacteria can become attached to or trapped within the soil\nstructure. It was evident from these studies that coliform bacteria and therefore\npathogenic microorganisms have the potential to survive in the environment and to\ntravel through the soil structure and enter groundwater.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bannister, Elaine","Lawton, Linda A.","Edwards, Tony","Reid, Donald","McGaw, Brian"],"dc:date":"2010-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60632,"sim:weight":0.425154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384788,"sim:weight":0.386292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2678842,"sim:weight":0.371237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384902,"sim:weight":0.365182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":383348,"sim:weight":0.339949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385581,"sim:weight":0.333102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.307945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":92216,"sim:weight":0.282314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69498,"sim:weight":0.278448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97759,"sim:weight":0.270719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60789,"sim:weight":0.269954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":92218,"sim:weight":0.264623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270121,"sim:weight":0.248391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.246283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.246282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62066,"sim:weight":0.223938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60165,"sim:weight":0.223847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.22332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55480,"sim:weight":0.220864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53911,"sim:weight":0.211902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Moreover, CSR research is fragmentary and often missing\nempirical corroboration. It lacks synthesis, uses CSR concepts and terms\nambiguously, and is inconsistent in the identification of CSR practices, its\nformulation and institutionalisation.\nThis study addresses these gaps and discontinuities by first\nsynthesising a range of theories into an explanatory framework. This\nframework provides the pre-understanding for the collection and analysis of\nqualitative data drawn from the UK oil and gas industry.\nThe findings highlight the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of CSR\noperationalisation. The analysis emphasises the dependence of CSR\nstrategy formulation on business leaders’ personal beliefs and biases. These\nbeliefs are tempered by balancing shareholders’ interests and stakeholders’\nexpectations, and are affected by the global (in the case of corporations) or\nthe local (in the case of corporate subsidiaries and small-medium size\nenterprises) contexts. These appear to be the main factors influencing\nleaders’ CSR decisions. The findings also demonstrate a number of\nchallenges that business leaders face when reconciling personal,\norganisational, industry, global, and societal values and ethical beliefs; and\nbalancing traditional organisational goals, such as profit maximisation, with\nincreased stakeholder empowerment in granting social legitimacy.\nIn addition, the exploration of CSR institutionalisation reveals different\napproaches in corporate subsidiaries, which fluctuate between the CSR\npractices of corporate headquarters and those of SMEs.

Against\nthis backdrop it appears that in less developed countries necessity and informal\nentrepreneurship are more prevalent than opportunity entrepreneurship. An\nexplanation from economic nature for this phenomenon is perhaps the fact that\nwith less job opportunities available in developing nations, the ‘need’ to become\nan entrepreneur seems to be the answer for females to make a living by creating\ntheir own jobs. At the socio cultural level, the motivation to become an\nentrepreneur out of need surfaces because of the socio cultural structure of\ncertain nations that hinder females from finding work that brings them\nindependence, self actualization and flexibility for work-life balance.\nThis qualitative exploratory study investigates the phenomenon of female\nentrepreneurship comparing female entrepreneurship in two contexts: Brazil and\nthe United States. The economic differences on a macro level between these two\ncountries have been well documented and national socio cultural differences\nhave been discussed. But very little has been focused at the individual level of the female entrepreneur per se, that is, how they perceive and experience the\neconomic and the social cultural macro environment with their businesses. This\nresearch attempts to fill this gap. This was done by first reviewing the literature\nand then by analysing the responses from face to face and telephone interviews\nwith 34 female entrepreneurs in Brazil and 26 in the United States.\nThe findings indicated that female entrepreneurs in Brazil and the United States\nshare similarities in motivation for starting the business in terms of pull factors,\nsuch as search for financial independence, want to be one’s own boss, need for\nautonomy, and self actualization. The women from both groups also identified\ncustomer satisfaction and recognition from society as key elements for their\nbusiness success. But business informality was a phenomenon only found among\nthe Brazilian enterprises (the informais) a factor found to be directly related to\neconomic necessity and the scarcity of waged jobs and opportunities. The\nperception of gender barriers was shared by both groups of entrepreneurs but\nother factors such as religion and the importance of faith to succeed in business\nwere emphasized only by the Americans. Higher education was perceived by\nboth groups as an instrument to gain recognition from society, but not important\nto grow their businesses; vocational training was perceived as more important.\nNetworking was perceived as important, but different patterns of networking\nemerged among the Brazilians and the Americans. Definitions of success also\ndiffer among the women independent from their nationality. Some were more\ninclined to define success in financial terms, others simply define success in\nterms of flexibility and the ‘got to be in control’ syndrome.\nThis research contributed to an increased understanding of the processes of\nfemale entrepreneurship as it related to how economic and socio cultural forces\ninfluence these processes. The findings indicated that the female entrepreneurship process becomes a combination of two processes: a person\ndriven process and a response to environment process. Mentoring and coaching\nprograms that assist women finding their path to entrepreneurship along with\ntheir own passions should be emphasized by local agencies. Although policy\ndevelopment was not the specific objective of this study, a number of issues\nhave arisen that have implications both for future research and female\nentrepreneurship policies. For instance, in Brazil, higher taxes and the high cost\nof starting a business were perceived by the women as barriers to their\nbusinesses. It is suggested that Brazilian authorities and legislators continue\nwith their efforts to streamline the business start process by introducing\ninnovative and cost effective ways to formalize a business.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holland-Noronha, Neila","Anderson, Alistair R."],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.565405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159504,"sim:weight":0.355633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.334843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.326852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.315027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.308868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.306683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316083,"sim:weight":0.304414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.295296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.292539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.279088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.262861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205946,"sim:weight":0.243148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Citing accessibility and participation as the\n‘cornerstone’ of their work, the Parliament’s institutional architects (the Consultative Steering\nGroup) argued that devolution should deliver a participatory democracy, with proactive efforts\nto be made by the Parliament to involve groups traditionally excluded from the policy process.\nDue to the increasing prominence in recent years of discourse relating to young people’s\ndisillusionment with organised politics and the CSG’s recommendation that every effort should\nbe made to include them in the new Parliament’s work, this research examines the degree to\nwhich greater accessibility to and participation in the Parliament’s work has been delivered for\nchildren and young people during the Parliament’s first two terms (1999‐2007). Findings are\nbased upon a mixed‐methodological case‐study approach, involving an audit of the\nParliament\u0027s activity and qualitative input from MSPs, Parliament staff, representatives of\nyouth charities / organisations / advocacy groups, and young people themselves.\nThe thesis argues that progress has been more pronounced in relation to accessibility than\nparticipation for younger people. The neoinstitutionalist theoretical framework suggests that\ninsufficient rule specification in relation to the value of public participation and younger\npeople has resulted in the emergence of hybridised logics of appropriate behaviour,\nparticularly among parliamentarians. The result is the persistence of attitudes and practices\nwhich appear to reinforce aspects of Westminster practice and an adultist approach to young\npeople’s role in politics. Drawing upon recent developments in neoinstitutionalist theories of\nreliable reproduction, institutional breakdown and gradual change, the thesis examines the\ninstitutional logic behind the failure to consolidate the Parliament’s founding vision.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacLeod, Iain M.","McLaverty, Peter","Halpin, Darren"],"dc:date":"2009-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.326156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821162,"sim:weight":0.313304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158609,"sim:weight":0.29637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158569,"sim:weight":0.293342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.240609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98731,"sim:weight":0.222547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84845,"sim:weight":0.219915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98472,"sim:weight":0.219409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929826,"sim:weight":0.196983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.196511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316484,"sim:weight":0.188991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thus,\neach agent has knowledge of the variables and corresponding domains of its local problem\ntogether with the constraints relating its own variables (intra-agent constraints) and\nthe constraints linking its local problem to other local problems (inter-agent constraints).\nDisCSPs have a variety of practical applications including, for example, meeting scheduling\nand sensor networks. Existing approaches to Distributed Constraint Satisfaction can\nbe mainly classified into two families of algorithms: systematic search and local search.\nSystematic search algorithms are complete but may take exponential time. Local search\nalgorithms often converge quicker to a solution for large problems but are incomplete.\nProblem solving could be improved through using hybrid algorithms combining the completeness\nof systematic search with the speed of local search.\nThis thesis explores hybrid (systematic + local search) algorithms which cooperate to\nsolve DisCSPs. Three new hybrid approaches which combine both systematic and local\nsearch for Distributed Constraint Satisfaction are presented: (i) DisHyb; (ii) Multi-Hyb\nand; (iii) Multi-HDCS. These approaches use distributed local search to gather information\nabout difficult variables and best values in the problem. Distributed systematic search is\nrun with a variable and value ordering determined by the knowledge learnt through local\nsearch.\nTwo implementations of each of the three approaches are presented: (i) using penalties\nas the distributed local search strategy and; (ii) using breakout as the distributed local\nsearch strategy. The three approaches are evaluated on several problem classes. The\nempirical evaluation shows these distributed hybrid approaches to significantly outperform\nboth systematic and local search DisCSP algorithms.\nDisHyb, Multi-Hyb and Multi-HDCS are shown to substantially speed-up distributed\nproblem solving with distributed systematic search taking less time to run by using the\ninformation learnt by distributed local search. As a consequence, larger problems can now\nbe solved in a more practical timeframe.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, David Alexander James","Arana, Ines","Ahriz, Hatem","Hui, Kit-Ying"],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1576339,"sim:weight":0.493733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931954,"sim:weight":0.345054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932093,"sim:weight":0.29756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.294573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1510160,"sim:weight":0.294551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98526,"sim:weight":0.269887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930875,"sim:weight":0.256678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998967,"sim:weight":0.214262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26006,"sim:weight":0.19694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931264,"sim:weight":0.192405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934037,"sim:weight":0.190793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931792,"sim:weight":0.189909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.179253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.176078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98723,"sim:weight":0.162857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932989,"sim:weight":0.151715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997844,"sim:weight":0.151382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.143068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84974,"sim:weight":0.137428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recent work has shown that bisnaphthalimidopropyl\nspermidine (BNIPSpd) bis-intercalates to DNA, induces oxidative DNA damage, depletes\npolyamine levels and causes cell death, by apoptosis, in human colon cancer CaCO-2\nand HT-29 cells. The aim of this thesis was to synthesise new BNIPP derivatives to\nhighlight the important structural features required for biological activity, particularly,\nbisnaphthalimidopropyl functionality, and investigate their subsequent modes of action in\nbreast cancer MDA-MB-231 and breast epithelial MCF-10A cells. Initially, work focused\non determining the DNA binding affinities and biological activity of BNIPP derivatives. All\nBNIPP derivatives, except bisphthalimidopropyl diaminodecane (BPHPDadec) and\nmononaphthalimidopropylamine (NPA) (Δ Tm values of 15.8 and 10.2 °C, respectively, C50\nvalues of \u003e 10 μM, IC50 values of \u003e 40 μM), exhibited strong DNA binding affinities and\ncytotoxic properties in both cell lines. Results indicate that BNIPP derivatives interact with\nDNA by bis-intercalation suggesting, therefore, that BNIPP derivatives target DNA. For\nthe first time, an investigation into the mechanism of cellular entry, via the polyamine\ntransport (PAT) system, was studied. However, none of the BNIPP derivatives utilised the\nMGBG-specific PAT system, suggesting that BNIPP derivatives utilise other modes of\ncellular entry. Two BNIPP derivatives, BNIPSpd and BNIPDaCHM, were further\ninvestigated, and results show that these derivatives significantly induced a dose\ndependent increase in DNA strand breaks from ≥ 0.1 μM, after 4 hours. BNIPSpd and\nBNIPDaCHM (at non toxic concentrations) also inhibited the repair of oxidative (H2O2) and\nmethylative (MMS)-induced DNA strand breaks. Based on phosphatidylserine exposure\nand membrane integrity analyses, early apoptotic cell death was determined as a mode of\ncell death utilised by both BNIPSpd and BNIPDaCHM (5 μM), after only 0.5 hours\ntreatment in MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, BNIPDaCHM was identified, using HDAC\nassay kits, as a potent and selective SIRT2 enzyme inhibitor, thus, identifying, a novel\nstructural backbone for the selective inhibition of HDAC enzymes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barron, Gemma A.","Kong, Paul Thoo Lin","Bermano, Giovanna","Gordon, Amanda"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929813,"sim:weight":0.252007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.241849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99171,"sim:weight":0.236149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108070,"sim:weight":0.209701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.209331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23819,"sim:weight":0.187955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.184078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.180853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69560,"sim:weight":0.162951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23283,"sim:weight":0.159116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.149981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98860,"sim:weight":0.143569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.142813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.140037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.13397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98971,"sim:weight":0.111975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Polyallylamine (PAA) was grafted with four different types\nof hydrophobic pendant groups (Cholesteryl (Ch), (Fmoc), (Dansyl)and (Naphth)). Some\namphiphilic polymers were further reacted with methyl orange to form quaternary\nammonium moieties. The polymers were characterised by elemental analysis and nuclear\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). In the aqueous environment the amphiphilic\npolymers formed nano self assemblies with particle size from 99 to 284 nm. The critical\naggregation concentration (CAC) of the self assemblies was successfully determined by\nsurface tension measurement. The CAC ranged from the lowest value of 0.093 to the\nhighest 1.5 mgmL-1 (Ch5 and Fmoc5 respectively). The Fmoc and Naphth grafted polymers\nshowed the presence of two CMC values, this phenomenon was due to stacking of the\nplanar hydrophobic ring structures resulting in excimer formation. The theory of excimer\nformation was confirmed by the observation of peak shifting on the emission spectra of\nthe compounds in water over a large concentration range (0.023 – 3 mgmL-1).\nThe drug loading potential of the polymers was investigated using five model hydrophobic\ndrugs, propofol, prednisolone griseofulvin, etoposide and novel anticancer agent\nBNIPDaoct. The Ch5 and Dansyl10 showed excellent drug solubilisation capacities. At 6\nmgmL-1 the Ch5 achieved propofol solubility 70-fold greater than its aqueous solubility,\nprednisolone, griseofulvin and etoposide solubility’s were increased 20-fold, 30-fold and\n7-fold respectively. Similarly at 6 mgmL-1 the Dansyl10 achieved a 200-fold increase on the\naqueous solubility of propofol and increased the solubility of prednisolone, griseofulvin\nand etoposide by 100-fold and 400-fold and 12-fold respectively. The Ch5 (at 1 mgmL-1)\nwas also used to solubilise the novel anticancer agent Bisnaphthalimidopropyl\ndiaminooctane (BNIPDaoct) which was otherwise insoluble achieving a solubilisation of\n0.3 mgmL-1. The sizes of the optimal formulations differed greatly for both modified\npolymers. This was possibly due to the varying architectures of both the drug and the\nmodified polymers and their ability to expand the hydrophobic core and shield the drugs\nfrom the ‘hostile’ aqueous environment.\nThe in vitro drug release profiles, showed controlled release of the hydrophobic drugs\nfrom the core of the nano aggregates (Ch5 and Dansyl10), the time span for 100% of the\ndrugs to be released ranged from 48- 96 h. Biological characterisation of the polymers\nfound that most of the polymers showed negligible haemolytic activity over the\nconcentrations tested (0.05 – 1 mgmL-1), the IC50 values for the cytotoxicity assay ranged\nfrom 0.01740 - 0.05585 mgmL-1 on Caco-2 cells (Fmoc5 to QCh5 respectively). The\nquaternized polymers showed a slightly better safety profile than their unquaternized\ncounterparts, despite exhibiting low drug solubilisation capacities. The optimal formulations of Ch5 and Dansyl10 loaded with etoposide and BNIPDaoct were tested for\ntheir cytotoxicity in vitro on Caco-2 and HEK293 cells. All formulations were capable of\nlowering the IC50 values when compared with the free anticancer drugs, thus increasing\ntheir therapeutic effect. The Ch5 decreased the solubility of etoposide 2.2-fold and\nBNIPDaoct 1.3-fold on Caco-2 cells, with Dansyl10 achieving a 14 -fold and 16–fold\nreduction respectively. In vivo oral administration of Ch5 and Dansyl10, griseofulvin\nformulations demonstrated significantly enhanced the absorption of griseofulvin\nabsorption in rats compared with griseofulvin in water (8.89-fold and 5.20-fold increase\nrespectively on total concentration of griseofulvin solubilised over 24 h study). A\nformulation of Ch5, BNIPDaoct was also shown to significantly decrease the tumour\ngrowth when treated on tumour bearing nude mice over a 4 week period. This is the first\ntime these novel PAA’s grafted with cholesteryl and dansyl have shown promising\npotential in hydrophobic drug delivery.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hoskins, Clare","Ping, Woei","Kong, Paul Thoo Lin"],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.305395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.26747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385531,"sim:weight":0.249143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.214196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2681780,"sim:weight":0.206174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567229,"sim:weight":0.1763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930758,"sim:weight":0.152907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98706,"sim:weight":0.147662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99319,"sim:weight":0.138348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98452,"sim:weight":0.133086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98848,"sim:weight":0.128414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98988,"sim:weight":0.123072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340647,"sim:weight":0.114364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1562733,"sim:weight":0.098776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Many of these strategies are very expensive (e. g. removal\nand disposal of the soil, covering the soil with uncontaminated soil, extraction with acids or\nchelates) whilst others provide only short term solutions (e. g. reduction of metal\nbioavailability by liming or adding organic matter). An alternative approach is the use of\nhyperaccumulator plants to remove the heavy metals. Phytoremediation, as this process is\nknown, is an attractive method for remediation of contaminated land since it is relatively\ninexpensive and has the potential through the appropriate selection of plant species to be\neffective. However, there are many factors that need to be considered for phytoremediation,\nperhaps the most important is the bioavailability of metals from different component or\nfunctional pools within the soil. The bioavailability of heavy metals has been assessed\nthrough a variety of approaches, with extraction using chemicals being the most common.\nAnother approach is the isotopic exchange method which has been regularly used for\nestimating the bioavailable P in soil. This technique relies on the assumption that isotopically\nexchangeable P is available to a growing plant and yields the so called E-value for a soil. In\npast studies, particularly in highly P fixing soils, the E-value has been shown to overestimate\nthe soil available P. To overcome this a second procedure based on the measurement of\nisotope uptake by a plant growing on a spiked soil has been proposed and yields the so called\nL-value. As well as P, this method has been applied to Ni and only very recently to Cd and\nZn using radioisotopes. In the present work, stable isotopes are used for the first time to\nmeasure the Cd and Zn available for plant uptake using isotopic exchange principles based on\nthe E and L-values using a contaminated (Great Billings) and a non-contaminated\n(Countesswells) soil. These values were compared to Cd and Zn bioavailable pool\ndetermined using more traditional chemical extraction methods (5 extractants). Of the\nchemical extractants O. 1M NaNO3,0.01M CaC12,0.5M NaOH, 0.43M CH3COOH and\n0.05M EDTA (pH\u003d7.0), the highest amounts of Cd and Zn were extracted by CH3COOH and\nEDTA. In addition, these two extractants extracted the Cd and Zn amounts close to the Lvalues\ndetermined using the isotopic exchange method.\nAn isotope dilution thermal ionisation mass spectrometric (ID-TIMS) method for an accurate and precise determination of Cd and Zn in soils and plants via isotope ratio\nmeasurements was developed. This was then validated by quantifying Cd and Zn in soils,\nplant and animal Certified Reference Materials digested by three different methods. In\naddition, there was no significant difference between open tube aqua regia, closed\nmicrowave bombs and HF digestion procedures which was related to the accurate definitive\nmethod of ID. Also, an approach for the sequential isotopic analysis of Cd and Zn on the\nsame filament within the TIMS was developed, allowing more rapid analysis and reducing\nrunning time on the instrument. Cd and Zn dual analysis on the same filament proved to be\nsuccessful and produced results comparable to single analysis.\nIsotopic ratios of Cd and Zn were used to determine both E and L-values in two soils.\nAlthough the E-value determined (in soil solution system) was higher than the L-value (using\nplants) for the 2 soils tested, the 2 values were generally within agreement. L-values were\ndetermined using 3 different plant species, the hyperaccumulator alpine penny cress (T.\ncaerulescens), dandelion (T. officinale) and spring barley (H. vulgare). The available pool of\nCd and Zn for plant uptake was determined to be the same for the 3 different plant species\nexamined although plant species had markedly different abilities to uptake metals.\nIn addition to using the plant species to estimate the bioavailable metals, the potential\nof these plant species for phytoremediation of Cd and Zn was also evaluated. Among the\nplants tested, only T caerulescens proved to be a Cd hyperaccumulator. However, T.\nofficinale removed an equivalent amount of Cd and more of Zn than the other two plant\nspecies; although its Cd and Zn content was not sufficiently high to be considered as a\nhyperaccumulator. Based on this, dandelion has a good potential for phytoremediation, which\nlead to an attempt to study Cd and Zn uptake in the rhizosphere of dandelion roots. However,\nthe experiment which used soil between glass plates did not show a clear depletion in Cd and\nZn concentrations towards the root surface or if metal concentration was related to the\namount of root present in any soil section.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ayoub, Ahmed S.","Midwood, Andrew","Shand, Charlie"],"dc:date":"2000-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99152,"sim:weight":0.420985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64151,"sim:weight":0.413382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62931,"sim:weight":0.375698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98576,"sim:weight":0.369266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384788,"sim:weight":0.365588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.350983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98560,"sim:weight":0.349071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":379741,"sim:weight":0.338197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97663,"sim:weight":0.332552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97757,"sim:weight":0.327029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61457,"sim:weight":0.294151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826655,"sim:weight":0.293584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58316,"sim:weight":0.266762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.257676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.257676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52152,"sim:weight":0.243529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23936,"sim:weight":0.23091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29432,"sim:weight":0.21116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734357,"sim:weight":0.205704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":267469,"sim:weight":0.204316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The effect of the different parliamentary\ncomponents (the Scottish Parliament as a whole, the Scottish Executive, the committees, the\ncommittee clerks and MSPs) on the groups is looked at in detail.\nTwo of the groups chose not to adopt insider strategies, believing that the parliamentary\ncommittees were the best venue for their organisations to target. During the early years of\nthe Scottish Parliament the six groups regarded the legislature (namely the committees) as a\ntarget to change policy and not just as a channel to the Scottish Executive.\nNew institutionalist theory was applicable in explaining the responses of the groups, although\none of the three approaches - rational choice, sociological and historical institutionalism – is\nmore applicable than the other two in certain circumstances. Sociological institutionalism is\nthe most applicable new institutionalist approach in explaining behaviour during the bringing\nabout of change; historical institutionalism is most applicable when change is being\nestablished as new institutions and rules are set up and rational choice institutionalism is the\nmost applicable approach during times of stability, allowing groups to look to their own self\ninterests.

Structured interviews determined patients\u0027 use of\nprescription and non-prescription therapies for pain relief, attitude to medication and\nperceived side effects.\nOutcomes measured were pain relief, influence of pain on activities using a\nquality of life (QOL) scale and side effects experienced. Pain relief was assessed\nusing the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and horizontal visual analogue scales\n(VAS). Poor outcomes were defined as at least one of the following: poor pain\ncontrol (VAS average pain greater than 75), total QOL score greater than 35, signs\nor symptoms of an adverse drug reaction, deliberate therapy change by patient due\nto lack of awareness of rationale of therapy or patient dissatisfaction. Patients with\npoor outcomes were given information or advice, referred to their GP and\ninterviewed after 4 to 6 weeks to determine any changes in outcomes.\nA total of 109 patients were identified of whom 96 agreed to participate; 42\nhad RA, 22 had osteoarthritis (OA), 25 had both OA and RA and 7 had low back\npain. Seventy-one patients were prescribed NSAIDs, 15 disease-modifiying agents\n(DMARDs) , 49 combination analgesics and 27 paracetamol. The majority of OA\npatients prescribed NSAIDs had no inflammation. Use of other therapies for pain\ne.g. anticonvulsants, hypnotics and herbal products was significantly higher in RA\npatients. Documentation of biochemical and haematological parameters in GP\nrecords was very limited.\nTwenty-eight patients had poor outcomes requiring GP referral, but also had\nsignificantly higher expectations of pain relief, higher pain and QOL scores\ncompared to the 68 patients with satisfactory outcomes. Suggestions for changing therapy in 24 of the 28 patients were discussed with the GP, the other 4 requiring\nsurgery. Although the pharmacist\u0027s recommendations were accepted and acted on in\n22 of the 24 patients, 7 were unwilling and 3 were too ill to be re-interviewed during\nthe study period. The pharmacist\u0027s recommendations were implemented in 12 of the\n14 patients who had a follow-up interview. Pain scores and QOL scores improved in\n9 and 8 patients respectively after pharmacist intervention. Twenty-four and 38\npatients respectively with satisfactory outcomes required advice to improve\nconcordance and to minimise the risk of side effects. Sixty-four patients reported\nside effects, 5 of whom required GP referral. Although there was a need for referral\nadvice and information, the small number of patients followed up did not allow\nestimation of the outcome measures\u0027 sensitivity to pharmacist intervention, thus the\nsecond aim was not fully achieved.\nPotential pharmacist role(s) within a primary care chronic pain team were\nidentified using questionnaires sent to a random selection of GPs, community\npharmacists and physiotherapists. Most pharmacists wanted to provide more\nanalgesic advice, a finding supported by most GPs and physiotherapists. This study\nhas demonstrated both a need for pharmacist input into chronic pain management\nand evidence that such input would be welcomed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Read, Rhona W.","Krska, Janet","Kendle, Keith"],"dc:date":"1998-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Biographical\ndetails of recently qualified accountants who trained within the whole spectrum of\nICAS training offices, were collected from a self-completion questionnaire. The data\ncollected was used to develop statistical models predicting two relevant pre-selection\ncriteria for the accounting profession, namely the ability to pass the professional\nexaminations at the first attempt and the probability of remaining with the training\nprovider for at least 18 months post qualification. The validity of the developed\nmodels for use within the Scottish accountancy profession was then evaluated.\nPhase I of the thesis developed two models which considered examination\nperformance, one based on honours graduates (n--183) and the other based on\nordinary graduates (n\u003d366) who qualified in the years 1988-1992. An empirical\napproach was adopted. Whilst statistically significant explanatory powers were\nidentified for each model, a disappointing shrinkage was experienced when the\nmodels were applied to trainees who qualified in the years 1993-94. Two possible\nexplanations were offered, the instability of the reference group and the empirical\nnature of the model derivation.\nPhase 11 of the thesis therefore adopted a more rational approach through the\nformulation of a conceptual framework. General background areas were hypothesised\nto be relevant in the determination of the criteria, and within these general areas\nspecific factors were highlighted and entered into the logistic regression models using\ndata from trainees who qualified in the years 1993-4. Statistically significant models\nwere developed for both fully-accredited honours (n---149) and ordinary graduates\n(n--225) and these models continued to retain their validity when applied to trainees\nwho qualified in 1995. The model developed for non-relevant honours students\n(n--61) was not significant highlighting the need for further work in this area.\nLikewise, from the data collected, an effective tenure model was not developed.\nThis thesis has provided an additional validity study for the technique of biodata. by\nidentifying that rationally derived biodata models can be used to differentiate between\nfully-accredited trainees who pass their WAS examinations at the first attempt and\nthose who experience failure. This work therefore provides training principals who\nemploy fully-accredited graduates to undertake WAS training with a useful preselection\ntool. It also provides evidence that rationally derived models appear to\nretain their validity and experience less shrinkage than models which were developed\nusing a more empirical approach. Finally, the work demonstrates that it is possible to\ndevelop biodata models which are transportable across the full spectrum of ICAS\nauthorised training offices and that biodata can therefore be transportable from one\norganisation to another.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gammie, Elizabeth Black Anderson","Weir, Charlie","Scroggie, Brian"],"dc:date":"1998-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109013,"sim:weight":0.29048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50121,"sim:weight":0.284068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99070,"sim:weight":0.272293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156802,"sim:weight":0.263851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55530,"sim:weight":0.240495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.240405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55995,"sim:weight":0.218399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.218259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155856,"sim:weight":0.211663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.210583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.195192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154421,"sim:weight":0.174546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.169118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154182,"sim:weight":0.168068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.108982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The\nindustry currently employs about 35,000 individuals directly and supports many more jobs indirectly. In\nshort, it is a very critical industry to the UK economy. But for all its contribution, there is a dearth of social\nscience and management research into the how the offshore industry is managed. This thesis reports the\nbackground and findings of an investigation into the first level of the platform production management\nteam and examines this role in terms of the personal characteristics and man-management skills required\nwithin this working environment.\nThis thesis was the first study that attempted to investigate the non-technical characteristics of high\nperforming supervisors. It examined the question of what makes an effective supervisor in terms of\nbiodata, personality, job satisfaction and perceptions of the work environment. The transformational\nmodel of Bass and Avolio (1990) was also adapted to assess leadership style. A specially designed semistructured\nquestionnaire was developed. The research sample comprised of one hundred first line\nsupervisors (operators and contractors), their subordinates and their superiors on three North Sea platforms.\nIt was hypothesised that effective offshore first line supervisors would have a distinct supervisory style\ncompared to less effective ones. Other aims included assessing the differences between supervisors\nworking on the UKCS and those on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS); and between supervisors\nworking for contracting companies as opposed to operating companies.\nThe key contributions of the thesis were in the following four areas; (i) the summary data that described the\noffshore first line supervisors, (ii) the findings from standard instruments, particularly the Bass leadership\ninstrument, identified that supervisory effectiveness was dependent on the platform membership of the\nsupervisor, (iii) the qualitative findings from the supervisory decision making vignettes and finally (iv) the\nplatform differences that were elicited from both within the UK sector and between the North Sea sectors.\nFor example, on one UK platform, UKI, the more effective supervisor displayed a more transactional\nleadership style, namely taking an active role in enforcing workplace standards. There was some evidence\nto suggest that dimensions of a transformational leadership style such as motivating subordinates through\npep talks and depicting visions of a better workplace were positively correlated with performance. These findings were broadly consistent with the results of previous research. In contrast, the second UK\nplatform, UK2, produced a different finding. This was surprising given the numerous physical and\norganisational characteristics that these two platforms had in common. The Norwegian platform sample\nwas small (n\u003d 19) and therefore correlational results were largely exploratory.\nFurther differences were revealed through multi-variate analyses between all three platforms based on\nleadership, job satisfaction and biodata variables. This implies that `effectiveness\u0027 may be dependent on\nthe platform membership of the supervisor. As an alternative explanation, these findings may suggest that\nthe standard instruments and appraisal measures were not sensitive enough to differentiate performance\nwithin this work environment. The Bass and Avolio (1990) leadership model, in particular, produced\ncontradictory findings and its usefulness in this context remains questionable. Qualitative evidence from\nthe total sample of effective supervisory behaviours, using a behavioural event interview method,\nsupported the quantitative findings from UK1 but broadly disagreed with the findings from UK2.\nMeasuring supervisors performance without reference to objective indices remains a weakness for this\nstyle of research.\nThe impact of these findings is discussed in the context of both practical recommendations for recruitment,\nselection and development for the supervisory population and future research into management research in\nthe offshore oil and gas industry.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carnegie, David","Flin, Rhona"],"dc:date":"1998-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.287893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.27609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821120,"sim:weight":0.256327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.213454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53666,"sim:weight":0.212939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.189408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.162338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The case study\ninvolved direct lesson observations as well as in-depth interviews and feedback sessions\nwith stakeholders in drug education including staff and 48 pupils. In both parts of the\nstudy schools were selected by theoretical sampling, each interview was transcribed in\nfull and all data were annotated and analysed with the aid of specialist computer\nsoftware. Validity and reliability were enhanced by constant vigilance in data analysis\nand by various procedures including reactivity analysis, peer examination,triangulation\nand consideration of any potential bias on the part of the researcher. The highest\nstandards of ethics were applied throughout the study.\nWhereas previous studies have revealed the lack of impact of drug education on drugtaking\nbehaviour in young people, this research is unique in attempting to explain this\nlack of impact. The research findings revealed that teaching and learning processes in\ndrug education were below best practice as defined by the relevant research literature\nand national guidelines. Four key underlying issues were identified: (1) A lack of clarity\nand understanding about the goals of drug education;( 2) A lack of time and support for\nresearching, planning and reviewing drug education; (3) A low priority assigned to\nPersonal and Social Education (PSE) in general; (4) A failure to recognise drug\neducation as a broad and complex subject requiring considerable expertise to teach.\nFundamental changes to how drug education is approached both locally and nationally\nwould be required to resolve these issues in full. Ihe nature of these changes is\ndiscussed in detail in the thesis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fitzgerald, Niamh","Stewart, Derek C.","Anderson, Gillian","Mackie, Clare","McCaig, Dorothy"],"dc:date":"2003-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8821113,"sim:weight":0.34427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316190,"sim:weight":0.315014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.298189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.296231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154182,"sim:weight":0.288439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.286394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56477,"sim:weight":0.268812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98717,"sim:weight":0.267005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98641,"sim:weight":0.263869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270152,"sim:weight":0.262894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.261253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795072,"sim:weight":0.259942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.255383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23668,"sim:weight":0.250179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155684,"sim:weight":0.249264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56576,"sim:weight":0.240974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.225213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In\nMulti-HDCS, each agent concurrently: (i) runs a centralised\nsystematic search for its complex local problem; (ii) participates in a\ndistributed local search; (iii) contributes to a distributed systematic\nsearch. A centralised systematic search algorithm runs on each\nagent, finding all non-interchangeable solutions to the agent’s\ncomplex local problem. In order to find a solution to the overall\nproblem, two distributed algorithms which only consider the local\nsolutions found by the centralised systematic searches are run: a\nlocal search algorithm identifies the parts of the problem which are\nmost difficult to satisfy, and this information is used in order to\nfind good dynamic variable orderings for a systematic search. We\npresent two implementations of our approach which differ in the\nstrategy used for local search: breakout and penalties on values.\nResults from an extensive empirical evaluation indicate that these\ntwo Multi-HDCS implementations are competitive against existing\ndistributed local and systematic search techniques on both solvable\nand unsolvable distributed CSPs with complex local problems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, David","Arana, Ines","Ahriz, Hatem","Hui, Kit-Ying"],"dc:date":"2010-09","doi":"10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.141","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1576339,"sim:weight":0.377194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931954,"sim:weight":0.328776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.290857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932361,"sim:weight":0.258281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28021,"sim:weight":0.254365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932093,"sim:weight":0.244876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98526,"sim:weight":0.239233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1510160,"sim:weight":0.226331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930875,"sim:weight":0.223877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932251,"sim:weight":0.222239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931420,"sim:weight":0.207873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931792,"sim:weight":0.19639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26006,"sim:weight":0.195838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931264,"sim:weight":0.193838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998967,"sim:weight":0.193676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934037,"sim:weight":0.190229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933069,"sim:weight":0.155336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932989,"sim:weight":0.147553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997844,"sim:weight":0.142395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933335,"sim:weight":0.141917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study, which was designed in two stages, aimed to\ninvestigate whether learning support needs were similar for full-time adult students\nand distance learners.\nIn the first stage, an original survey instrument was designed and posted to a\ngroup of nursing students who had undertaken a diploma-level course (n\u003d169). A\nresponse rate of 69% was achieved. It aimed to determine whether the learning\nand educational support needs were similar between these two groups. The\nfindings suggested that the learning and educational needs were alike and\nsuggested the need for proactive support with adult learners, irrespective of their\nmode of study.\nIn the second stage, a phenomenological approach was used to determine the\nexperiences of the first cohort of graduates from a distance-learning degree course\nin community nursing (n\u003d6); their community supervisors (n\u003d9) and the academic\nstaff involved with the course(n\u003d7).

Less attention has, however, been given to specific ways in which engagement with these resources might enhance health care professionals’ understanding of the experience of service users, carers and of their own practice with a view to improving health and social care practice.\nIn this chapter, we argue that literature and poetry have the potential to deepen professional understanding by literary devices such as metaphor articulating, effectively, some of the most complex, elusive and subtle aspects of human experiences. Literature and poetry have the potential to enable professionals to develop ethical perception and imagination. The close attention that can be developed from reading poetry and literature is, arguably, transferable to practice contexts. Professionals can develop the ability to see more clearly the salient aspects of a practice situation. This is a precursor to ethical and professional practice. Poetry and literature are not the only resources that can be used to develop ethical perception or ethical practice. Insights from qualitative research and the visual arts are also valuable for enhancing ethical perception and ethical practice.\nWe begin with a general discussion of the relationship between the arts and health and social care offering some critique as well as a discussion of the benefits of the arts. We then discuss, more specifically, the potential of poetry and literature and consider claims that they enhance ethical perception. Metaphor is a common literary device and we consider its potential in relation to the experience of illness, distress and caring. In later sections we provide examples of literature and poetry in relation to the experience of: service users, carers and professionals. We discuss practical ways in which the educationalist might adopt this approach in helping students and others to better understand and respond to the views and experiences of service users, carers and other professionals in different therapeutic and caring contexts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gallagher, A.","McKie, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Interestingly, we found that institutional factors that determine self-employment and innovation may act in opposite directions: what encourages self-employment might discourage innovation and vice-versa.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harbi, Sana El","Anderson, Alistair R."],"dc:date":"2010-06","doi":"10.1016/j.socec.2010.02.011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.362404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159504,"sim:weight":0.343454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162107,"sim:weight":0.330473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162908,"sim:weight":0.271138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158180,"sim:weight":0.263604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.236189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108827,"sim:weight":0.224253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162456,"sim:weight":0.163935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.158764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.158481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162458,"sim:weight":0.149712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.138402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155853,"sim:weight":0.111594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It suggests that capturing and analysing visitor stories whilst in the destination can facilitate understanding of how destination image changes with actual experience, and what factors or attributes are important, thereby offering a deeper insight into the process through which destination experience is transformed (sense making) and transmitted (sense giving) via those stories, that all important word of mouth publicity.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach: Unstructured interviews were recorded with visitors in Edinburgh and Greenwich.  An interpretive approach was employed in analysing the interview data to uncover facets of visitor experience affecting the image conveyed through the narrative.\n\nFindings:  The research reveals three elements involved in the sense making and sense giving process and sets out the three categories of visitor consumption characteristics which are implicated in the process.\n\nResearch implications:  Although the outcomes of the sense making and sense giving process are mediated by the incidents, interactions and characteristics of the individual visitor, the process itself is common to all visitors.  Analysing visitor narratives to uncover the mediating factors illuminates the visitor’s actual destination experience and its impact on their understanding or image of a destination. Narratives proved to be a useful research tool.\n\nPractical implications:  The interview and analysis techniques used could be readily adapted for use alongside existing standardised visitor survey tools to provide destination managers and marketers a greater understanding of the impact of customer care and visitor management programmes and how narrative may be useful in tailoring destination marketing to meet the requirements of specific visitor groups.\n\nOriginality/value:  This research demonstrates the utility of capturing and analysing visitor narratives at the point of destination consumption for understanding actual destination experience and the way in which it is transmitted as word of mouth information to others.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guthrie, Cathy","Anderson, Alistair R."],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1108/13522751011032575","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":61142,"sim:weight":0.279372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931333,"sim:weight":0.208307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.193846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.182716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.159027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184248,"sim:weight":0.158786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585490,"sim:weight":0.147514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.140904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The period of analysis is 1991-95, covering\nthe year prior to reform up to the final year of the transitional period.\nThe MacSharry reforms were deemed the most radical of all CAP reforms in\nits 30-year history. Named after Ray MacSharry, then Agricultural Commissioner,\nthese reforms went further than any previously proposed. The reforms occurred as\na result of years of internal domestic problems associated with high budgetary costs\nand surplus products together with international pressures resulting from the\nUruguay Round General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations.\nThe reforms were innovative in that they shifted farm support away from high\nguaranteed prices for farm produce towards direct income payments to farmers.\nThis thesis examines the MacSharry reforms in depth and attempts to\ndetermine their impact upon both Grampian agriculture and agriculture-related\nindustries as any changes to agriculture affect upstream and downstream sectors. In\naddition the thesis examines agricultural industry change in the region as farmers\nare found to be increasingly moving towards diversification and alternative farming\nmethods in an attempt to generate additional farm income. In determining the\nimpact of the reforms, the thesis thereby ascertains whether the implementation of\nthe reforms was successful or not in the region. Analysis of this impact is made\nthrough the use of both primary and secondary data collection methods. The\nconclusion drawn from this methodology is that the reforms were successful\nregarding agriculture per se. As MacSharry had intended, production in arable and\nlivestock sectors were reduced, farmers\u0027 incomes increased and those benefiting\nmost appeared to be the smaller producers. However, contrary to predictions, the\nresearch on agriculture-related industries in the region suggested that the reforms\nhad not adversely affected local businesses. Furthermore, the examination of farm\ndiversification indicated that although diversification in the region was becoming\nincreasingly popular this did not appear to be as a result of CAP reform.\nAlthough there is an overall lack of literature on whether the MacSharry\nreforms were successful or not when implemented in the EU, this example of one\nScottish region illustrates how the reforms worked out in practice, demonstrating\nvarying degrees of success across different sectors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stewart, Rachel Smith","Levy, Roger"],"dc:date":"2000-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85514,"sim:weight":0.290946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.28872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496179,"sim:weight":0.273321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":658869,"sim:weight":0.245139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.241822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98654,"sim:weight":0.238534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108833,"sim:weight":0.226988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930218,"sim:weight":0.222834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26013,"sim:weight":0.21682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26012,"sim:weight":0.21682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98831,"sim:weight":0.21659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227019,"sim:weight":0.2065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109132,"sim:weight":0.165388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85356,"sim:weight":0.1504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, the objective was to\nestablishing how, and if, virtual interactions enhanced collaborative incremental\nproduct innovation in supplier-customer networks within biotechnology SMEs (Small\nand Medium Sized Enterprises). Employing a phenomenological approach, two data\ncollection techniques were used; participant observation within a small\nbiotechnology firm provided a preliminary study and was followed by 16 in-depth\ninterviews with bioscience entrepreneurs in SMEs in Scotland.\nThe results indicated that entrepreneurial networking was important for the\ngeneration of collaborative incremental innovation; innovation opportunities were\nembedded in entrepreneurial networking process. In addition, the study found that\nthe networking process was complex and dynamic but was punctuated by several\nrelationship stages, whereby each stage constituted a relationship state. Each state\ncould be characterized as dynamic and complex but an evolving relationship stage.\nThe progress of collaboration was thus dependent on the evolution of the\nrelationship. Moreover, the research identified trust to be the key determinant of the\nrelationship process; the nature of trust invoked was found to be dynamic,\nprogressive and multi-dimensional.\nThe study explored and classified how the entrepreneurs used three “ideal types” of\nnetworking strategies to engage in the trust formation process. These were, namely,\nTechnical, Combined and Social Approach, utilised in different relationship situations.\nFurthermore, the study showed how factors, such as inter-personal characteristics\nfor bonding social capital, the use of virtual interaction, trust process, the level of\nknowledge tacitness and relationship processes, all impacted on the collaboration for\nincremental innovation. Importantly, the study indicated that an understanding of\nvirtual interaction needed to be contextualised in the circumstances and conditions\nof the entrepreneurial networking process.\nConsequently this study contributes to knowledge in the areas of entrepreneurial\nnetworking process, virtual interaction, supplier-customer relationships, trust and\nproduct innovation generation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hardwick, Jialin Yue","Anderson, Alistair R.","Cruickshank, Douglas"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1555349,"sim:weight":0.437594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99151,"sim:weight":0.34504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58828,"sim:weight":0.338515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.309129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269906,"sim:weight":0.276545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77627,"sim:weight":0.228846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75280,"sim:weight":0.217359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.217034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.185077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75903,"sim:weight":0.159225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158997,"sim:weight":0.14646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99451,"sim:weight":0.142158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At the national level within the EU, there has been much experimentation\nwith different policy instruments with varying levels of success. Nevertheless the EU\nas a whole will not meet its stipulated renewable energy target. This study challenges\nthe theoretical and abstract evaluation presented in the literature about EU wind\npower delivery systems and has developed an integrative evaluation framework. This\nevaluation framework is used in this study to present the views of key stakeholders on\ntheir experiences with the performance of key policy instruments (feed-in tariff, and\nrenewables obligation) implemented in three EU Member States namely: Germany,\nThe Netherlands, and United Kingdom. It also challenges the EU-wide harmonised\nrenewable energy policy agenda as proposed in Directive 2001/77/EC. The concept of\npath dependency of the historical institutional approach was adopted in order to\nexplore the diversity of the wind power industry across the three country cases. An indepth\nsemi-structured interview with fifty-five senior wind power policy makers and\nexperts was conducted to explore the historical emergence, the architect, and the\noutcome of the support and implementation of the policy instruments. Findings\nshowed that the approach to wind power deployment in the three country cases differs\nsignificantly and this has affected the pattern of each country’s wind power policy\ninstrument. Also, the role and contribution of the stakeholder groups to the success of\nthe wind power policy instruments differ significantly in each of the country cases.\nThis helps to explain the performance of the different policy instruments adopted.\nConcerning the harmonisation of EU renewable energy policy instruments which have\nreceived much attention in recent times, this study found that harmonisation based on\na single policy instrument is not feasible and may ultimately inhibit the growth of the\nEuropean wind power market. A harmonised system may cause uncertainties amongst\nwilling investors, thereby causing a withdrawal of further investment in the wind\npower market. If this happens, Europe may also lose its position as the world leader in\nthe wind power market. Furthermore, national histories demonstrates that Member\nStates have different culture, stakeholder groups, political, and business practices that\nwill influence policy instruments and the likelihood of any policy succeeding. Thus,\nrather than promoting harmonisation and political market for wind power, it is\nimportant that Member States adopt and implement, stable, flexible, and transparent\npolicy instruments that enable wind power and other renewable energy sources to\nemerge, develop, and go through the R\u0026D stage to a point of maturity where they can\ncompete with other energy sources with limited financial support.","bibo:AuthorList":["Otitoju, Afolabi","Strachan, Peter","Lal, David","Mclaverty, Peter"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.242993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.236041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.231564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.178095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.114414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The petroleum sludge wastes typically are water-in-oil emulsion that are stabilised by fine solids.\nThe Hazardous Waste Directive classifies oily sludges and oil contaminated solids as hazardous waste due to its carcinogenic nature. The directive specifies that an oil concentration of more than 0.1% in solids have a risk of causing cancer to humans making it hazardous. Traditionally such wastes have been landfilled. Hazardous waste such as the above has higher landfill costs charged by the landfill operators and also higher landfill tax compared to non-hazardous waste. Such wastes generated throughout Scotland needs to be transported to England and Wales for suitable disposal or treatment and recovery. With the implementation of new legislations such as EU landfill directive the existing option of transportation and disposal turns out to be costly to the tune of ₤300 per tonne. Hence it is important to find an alternative option for treating such wastes locally in order to avoid transportation of these wastes and also position industries to offer an environmentally sustainable solid waste treatment system.\nThis thesis reports a study of various technologies examined in the development of an oily sludge treatment process and summarises results from lab trials, site trials and site visits to technology suppliers. In addition to developing a treatment chain this report concludes by recommending that treatment of oily sludge from hazardous waste to inert waste standards can only be achieved utilising thermal treatment methods. This can either be plasma, microwave or infrared technology based thermal treatment and needs to be decided on a case to case basis. An indicative cost benefit analysis presented provides an indication of capital and operational expenditure for the above technology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ramachandran, Vinod","Robertson, Peter K.

We find that increasing sophistication in SFA deployment, evaluated as a count of the number of types of results of sales campaigns that are measured, is driven directly by the information orientation of the host firm. We also find that the “sophistication” of deployed systems is, in fact, limited – the information held on the systems cannot underpin the strategic goals of the sales/marketing managers. We theorise that adoption of SFA systems is driven by managerial imperatives and that these has resulted in sales-force resistance – shown by the paucity of information held on adopted SFA systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wright, George","Fletcher, Keith","Donaldson, Bill"],"dc:date":"2008-11","doi":"10.1016/j.indmarman.2007.08.005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":65541,"sim:weight":0.616178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59091,"sim:weight":0.239826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.232298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.22069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5846753,"sim:weight":0.194735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108823,"sim:weight":0.179938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108236,"sim:weight":0.176894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58835,"sim:weight":0.163355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59026,"sim:weight":0.160528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.15684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99451,"sim:weight":0.143132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.0944904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The\nresearch thus began by asking, ‘how well does entrepreneurship explain the\nrecycling industry?’\nThis research focuses on the recycling entrepreneurs’ entrepreneurial\nexperiences and their relationships with their social context. Twenty-five\nrecycling entrepreneurs were interviewed in-depth using unstructured\ninterviews as the primary data collection method. Inductive analysis has been\napplied to these data on multiple levels.\nFirstly, a context (structure) level analysis identified a green culture and\nstructure arising from social demands pertaining to environmental concerns\nand the corresponding political responses that gave rise to socio-cultural and\neconomic implications. Secondly, an entrepreneur (agent) level analysis\nrevealed that the entrepreneurs’ motivation to start and continue recycling\nbusinesses was attached to a particular value perception of the recycling\nopportunity. This orientation underlies the different forms of opportunity\nconstructions. Analysis at the process level drew upon the interactive\nprocesses between the preceding two levels to understand the dynamic\nrelationship between structure and agency. The analysis demonstrated the\nentrepreneurs’ role in manifesting entrepreneurial events via value extraction\nprocesses realised through embeddedness. This included different ways of\nadaptation to the green structure, adoption of green values and the forging of\nties. In doing so, they imbued the structure with an apparent overarching\ncreation of green values.\nThe novel analytical approach adopted for this study provides avenues of\nadvancement in entrepreneurship research: firstly, in the adoption of value orientation as the unit of analysis; and secondly, in the dynamic nature of the\nanalytical approach which explored the interrelatedness between structure,\nagent and agency. This analysis has identified a paradox whereby\nentrepreneurs who lack green value orientations are nevertheless performing\ngreen actions and thus perpetuating the green socio-political context. Another\ncontribution of this research lies in its thesis that the increasing emphasis in\nthe recycling industry is a social construction of reality, but one given an\nobjective nature attached to the language of ‘green’. This is intensified by the\nentrepreneurs’ articulation of their reality. Thus, as well as its contribution to\nboth entrepreneurship and recycling literatures, the study provides an\ninformed platform for policy makers and practitioners.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gan, Bee Ching","McDonald, Seonaidh","Anderson, Alistair R."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.377596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14072,"sim:weight":0.322416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98465,"sim:weight":0.269653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.23411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.22537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.222418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.221703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the contribution that these\norganizations make towards the abilities of local actors remains unclear.\nFollowing a hermeneutic reflection on literature, empirical field experience derived from the\nAfrican and South Pacific contexts and a multiple case study analysis of craft development\norganizations, the research investigates the pre-conceptions that lie behind approaches adopted\nin craft development initiatives. Two emerging elements of particular importance have been\nidentified. Firstly, the Western ideological notion of craft, influenced particularly by the Arts\nand Crafts movement, and secondly the ethos of social design, built on the legacy of the\nappropriate technology movement. It is argued that both of these have a constraining impact on\nthe development of indigenous design skills that underpin successful participation in global\nmarkets.\nNoting that craft covers a wide range of practices, the research at hand furthermore identifies a\ncategory of craft that has become the epitome of Non-Western craft. These decorative and\nexotic artifacts are labor-intensive to produce, making them only marginally profitable for the\nmakers. Yet there is an apparent emphasis on the promotion of this category within\ninternational craft development initiatives.\nThe research concludes that the current practice of craft development initiatives cannot fully\ncontribute to the development of the response capability of the local craft producers. Enhancing\nthe impact of these initiatives would require serious reconsideration of product strategies and a\nre-think of the premises under which initiatives are undertaken. A new approach is suggested,\none that examines design within a framework of social, economic and ecological sustainability,\ntaking into consideration such socio-cultural issues as the peoples’ right to economic freedoms\nand the use of capabilities, building on the work of the economist and Nobel Laureate Amartya\nSen.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reijonen, Eeva Katriina","Malins, Julian Paul","Gray, Carole","Korvenmaa, Pekka"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

IFAC (2003a) suggest that purely theoretical and knowledge-based education does not meet the needs of all employers. Thus professional bodies are encouraged to find ways to deliver and assess relevant competences in the most appropriate manner. Despite educationalists suggesting that performance measurements based on direct observation within the work place are more effective at measuring competences than traditional paper based examinations, assessment strategies within the accountancy domain remain conservative. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) was one of the first professional bodies to introduce a competency-based approach to work based assessment in 1999 and subsequently undertook a review of the process in 2004. The data collected for the review was undertaken by way of a questionnaire to authorised training offices, in depth interviews with employers and discussions which emanated from a Working Party which included internal ICAS employees, an academic and a representative from a large accountancy firm. This paper presents the findings of the review, discusses the pertinent issues in relation to work based assessment and outlines the changes that were made to the competency-based approach adopted by ICAS.

{"identifier":1576751,"ep:Repository":84,"dc:type":["Thesis or dissertation","Doctoral","PhD"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Molecular aspects of the link between obesity, insulin resistance and breast cancer.","bibo:abstract":"Obesity is a multi-factorial metabolic disease, resulting in increased adipose tissue acquisition by the host. This disease increases the risk for developing co-morbidities, including Metabolic Syndrome and other disorders such as breast cancer. Obesity, and particularly abdominal obesity, is characterised by metabolic changes, including chronically elevated insulin concentrations and aberrant secretion of cytokines released from fat tissue, called adipokines. Epidemiologically, the risk of developing postmenopausal breast cancer is increased in obese individuals. The molecular link between obesity and breast cancer however is not well understood. The study presented here aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in this link, by testing the hypothesis that high insulin concentration and certain adipokines may promote breast cancer progression and/or breast cancer aetiology.\nA cell culture system of breast cancer cells and breast epithelial cells was employed to investigate changes in cell proliferation, activation of cell signalling pathways, cell cycle progression and apoptosis after treatment with insulin, leptin, TNF-α, adiponectin and IL-6.\nIn MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, insulin treatment did not affect cell proliferation, cell cycle or apoptosis. Conversely, IR-phosphorylation, AKT-phosphorylation and ERK1/2-phosphorylation were all significantly increased. Microarray analysis indicated several important changes in gene expression with insulin treatment. Leptin treatment increased proliferation by 21%. Additional analyses of the effect of leptin indicated that neither the PI3-kinase pathway nor the MAP-kinase pathway was involved in mediating this effect. Treatment with TNF-α increased apoptosis, but did not affect cell proliferation or activation of cell signalling pathways.\nIn MCF-10A breast epithelial cells, cell proliferation increased after insulin treatment by 180%. IR-phosphorylation, AKT-phosphorylation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were all significantly increased while early apoptosis decreased after insulin treatment. Analysis of cell cycle however did not indicate a change in progression. Microarray analysis indicated that insulin treatment may increase expression of genes related to cancer growth. Leptin treatment increased cell proliferation and also increased ERK1/2-phosphorylation, while AKT-phosphorylation was not affected. Leptin did not change cell cycle progression. TNF-α treatment increased cell proliferation and also increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, while AKT-phosphorylation was not changed. TNF-α treatment tended to increase apoptosis, the change however was not statistically significant.\nIn SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells, cell proliferation did not change after insulin treatment. IR-phosphorylation and AKT-phosphorylation increased after insulin treatment, while ERK1/2-phosphorylation decreased. Gene expression of cyclin D and cyclin E increased with insulin treatment, while apoptotic rate and cell cycle profile were also not affected. Cell proliferation increased by 115% after treatment with 100 ng/ml leptin. ERK1/2-phosphorylation however decreased, while AKT-phosphorylation tended to increase, but the change was not statistically significant. Cell cycle profile was not affected by leptin treatment, G1-phase however tended to increase, but the change was again not statistically significant. Cell proliferation increased by 59% after 48 h treatment with 10 ng/ml TNF-α. AKT-phosphorylation and ERK1/2-phosphorylation increased with TNF-α treatment. Cell cycle analysis showed a decrease in S-phase and G2-phase, indicative of a decrease in cell cycle progression.\nThese results indicate that none of the examined obesity-related factors is convincingly identified as the main molecular link between obesity and postmenopausal breast cancer. Conversely, all treatments affected each of the cell lines in, at least, one of the examined aspects. This indicates that many of the obesity-related factors may affect breast cancer and that a single breast tumour may utilise a unique combination of those factors to promote growth. All treatments increased proliferation in MCF-10A breast epithelial cells, with additional analysis generally supporting growth promotion. Insulin treatment particularly increased cell proliferation, while leptin and TNF-α increased MAP-kinase signalling. This may indicate that insulin and adipokines may have a higher impact on breast cancer aetiology than on breast cancer progression.","bibo:AuthorList":["Weichhaus, Michael Georg","Bermano, Giovanna","Broom, John","Wahle, Klaus"],"dc:date":"2010-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23815,"sim:weight":0.385725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.275201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269848,"sim:weight":0.245067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4869738,"sim:weight":0.228561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99270,"sim:weight":0.226959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.187223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25865,"sim:weight":0.152136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.134402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.107994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23977,"sim:weight":0.107994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is reflected in the rhetoric of the necessity for managers and\nemployees to ‘transform’ themselves from ‘locals’ into ‘cosmopolitans’. This uplifting\nrhetoric of ‘transformation’ is however accompanied by the more prosaic discourse of\ncosmopolitanism as a competence in ‘managing culture’ which can be acquired by all.\nSecondly, ‘corporate cosmopolitanism’ draws on a ‘postmodern’ ideal of a flexible\n‘pastiche’ identity, distanced through irony from all existing cultural and other ‘hot’\nloyalties. This discourse is personified in the image of the ‘hybrid’ as the ideal corporate\ncosmopolitan. The paper argues that corporate cosmopolitanism represents, not a utopia\nin which cultural difference and diversity is respected and celebrated, but a dystopia in\nwhich cultural difference is made superfluous by the establishment of a flexible\ntransnational capitalist class with no attachment to or responsibility for place.","bibo:AuthorList":["Halsall, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009-03","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-8551.2008.00637.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":79095,"sim:weight":0.371638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98865,"sim:weight":0.238564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109078,"sim:weight":0.236819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340689,"sim:weight":0.217839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.20594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98879,"sim:weight":0.200379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.197079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.181573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.177982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.164351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.16141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99058,"sim:weight":0.144732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99117,"sim:weight":0.13935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To explain this, the study had to extend beyond the\nmore usual focus of research attention, the inmediate relationship\nbetween employer and employee, to examine the wider commercial\nrelationship between the major oil companies and their contractors\nfrom the perspective of both parties. The response of the trade\nunions is assessed in this broader context.\nIn a relatively short period of time an industrial relations\nsystem of considerable complexity has developed. The spreading of\nfinancial risk by the operating companies (oil majors) is paralleled\nin industrial relations by the delegation of responsibility to\ncontractors. As a result, a two tier workforce has developed. The\nstudy analyses the processes at work, drawing on a range of\ninterview, observation and archival techniques.\nCollective bargaining has been widely used to cope with the\nlabour problems posed by these extreme financial and environmental\ncircumstances. It is demonstrated that this has sometimes been\nimposed upon the contractors and that it operates at both the\nmUlti-employer, industry level, and at that of the individual\ncompany. However, the thesis concludes that this collective\nbargaining rests more on loose, informal agreements, and trade union\nlobbying, rather than formal agreements and procedures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thom, Alix Ann","Gourlay, Douglas","Brown, William"],"dc:date":"1989-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.30477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108856,"sim:weight":0.298003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.295986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108806,"sim:weight":0.292351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108603,"sim:weight":0.275186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316057,"sim:weight":0.270948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.254342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.241242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158997,"sim:weight":0.187999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.157121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The role embraces\nthree main activities: joint collective bargaining, training and\ndevelopment and other support activities.\nThe history of the joint collective bargaining activity now undertaken by\nthe Convention on behalf of constituent local authorities spans almost\nhalf a century. The conclusion is drawn that it has developed on a\nsomewhat piecemeal basis and that despite attempts, most recently in\n1986, to introduce a greater element of co-ordination, the present\narrangements are unnecessarily complex. Some of the negotiating\narrangements are UK-wide, others have a link in to UK arrangements with\nsubordinate Scottish machinery and yet others are unique to Scottish\nlocal government. The various negotiating bodies have different dates\nthroughout the year for the settlement of pay claims and there is scope\nfor the creation of anomalies between negotiating groups, since each\nnegotiates and settles independently of the others.\nThe training and development activities of the convention have a much\nshorter history. The minimal allocation of resources to these activities\nis criticised. The conclusion is drawn that without a greater\nallocation, local authorities in Scotland will continue to receive an\nimpoverished service. The range of other support activities is also\nquite limited, although there has been a discernable development in these\nover the past four or five years.\ncomparison is made between the present levels of provision and the\nrecommendations of official reports on the provision of central personnel\nsupport in local government, spanning some 60 years, which endorses the\nconclusions drawn, that Scottish local government is not well served by\nthe provision currently made by its central organisation.\nIn relation to the collective bargaining activity, the international\nelement of the research concludes by reference to all four comparator\ncountries that it is possible to develop and work within a less complex\nmodel. On the other hand none of the comparators endures the\ncomplications of a relationship with negotiating arrangements covering a\nwider geographical area. The international comparison also highlights\nthe extensive nature of the training and development activities of the\nlocal authority associations in three out of the four countries, and\nconcludes that there is generally a greater availability of other support\nservices.\nFinally, the thesis refers to the government\u0027s proposals for the\nreorganisation of local government in Scotland in the mid-1990s and\nsuggests that the Convention should plan now for an appropriate\nenhancement of its role as an employers\u0027 organisation in support of the\nlocal government structure that will be in place following the\nreorganisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smart, Peter John","Gourlay, Douglas","Urwin, Derek","Leek, Chris"],"dc:date":"1992-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4154941,"sim:weight":0.343936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316057,"sim:weight":0.311622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162931,"sim:weight":0.311081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.308046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158997,"sim:weight":0.303468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160216,"sim:weight":0.299863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108211,"sim:weight":0.296274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159474,"sim:weight":0.288203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159127,"sim:weight":0.284835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4150929,"sim:weight":0.283798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108603,"sim:weight":0.267637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269950,"sim:weight":0.25608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160825,"sim:weight":0.246642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.243745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This has been investigated through a\npractice-led approach, which implicitly involves the researchers\u0027 professional practice\nas a visual artist printmaker.\nThe cross disciplinary nature of this practice-led research has established that diverse\nand non-text based sources be included in the literature review. The resulting\ncontextual review established the evolutionary nature of printmaking practices, the\nrole played by individual artists perceptions of risk, and the limited ability of available\nliterature to adequately link evolving and didactic creative practices to emergent\nboundaries established by environmental and occupational health and safety\nlegislative criteria. There was evidently no theoretical framework for linking these\napparently divergent criteria.\nThe multi-disciplinary and practice-led context i. e. the research was generated by\npractice and carried out through practice, determined the range of methods employed:\nquestionnaire, quantitative tests of materials; participation in, and initiation of\ncollaborative case studies; documenting workshop practice and visual development of\nprinted art works; and exhibition for peer review. These multiple methods and their\ncomplex interrelationships were visualised as a system of consequential actions, in\norder to externalise possible alternative actions and choices made by the researcher in\nresponse to this research.\nAnalysis of these methods revealed that: the collaborative case studies and the\nresearcher\u0027s own visual and practical response, established that a systematic\nrevaluation of practice could link the idiosyncratic and individual creative practices to\nthe use and selection of nonhazardous practices, which did respond to objective\noccupational health and safety rationale. This revealed the extent to which a\nsystematic re-evaluation of \u0027established practices\u0027 may be synthesised into the working\npractice of the researcher and lead to the diversification of that practice - visually and\npractically.\nThis process has resulted in the generation of a body of printed art works which\nimplicitly embodied the hypothesis developed in this research; the development of a\nelectronic database or \u0027morphological framework\u0027, which initiates a sequential\nexamination of process at a structural level, collating, comparing and promoting\npreviously un-considered alternatives based on a heterarchical model of risk. This\nprocess has offered tangible means of visualising the generative processes involved in\nmaking prints. The \u0027morphological framework\u0027 has implicitly linked the researcher\u0027s\nprintmaking to a sustainable and environmentally sensitive creative practice, which is\nmethodologically transparent and procedurally transferable.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pengelly, Jon","Gray, Carole"],"dc:date":"1997-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.345523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351671,"sim:weight":0.312709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447708,"sim:weight":0.252515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.234755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.220521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57679,"sim:weight":0.174507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.12399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To date there has\nbeen very little research on self-assessment in higher education courses which\nprepare health professionals for their future careers.\nThe project aimed to investigate occupational therapy students\u0027 self-evaluation\nskills during their professional education and within their first work-place.\nThis practice based investigation was conducted by a member of academic staff in\none of the two centres in Scotland offering a BSc in Occupational Therapy course.\nData was collected from two different universities offering the course, the study\nperiod was the academic years from 1992 to 1996. Four different research tools\nwere used, a content analysis of relevant course documents was carried out; 113\nstudents and 15 academic staff were surveyed using questionnaires, with regard to\ntheir understanding and use of self-assessment within the course; self-grading of\nacademic work by three cohorts of students (n\u003d113) was conducted and fifteen\ngraduates and workplace supervisors health care and social work were\ninterviewed through the use of repertory grid interviews.\nSelf-evaluation was emphasised and strongly, linked to professional development,\nwithin the course documents of both universities. Students and academic stab\nidentified clinical placements as the area within which, most commonly selfassessment\noccurred and developed. Students were generally positive with regard to self-assessment being used within the academic components of the course,\nhowever, staff were more hesitant.\nThe students consistently under-rated their academic assessments although the\nmajority were within a five-percent range of the experts\u0027 marks. One cohort of\nstudents did demonstrate an improvement in self-assessment over the three years\nbut similar trends were not detected with the other two cohorts.\nThe repertory grid interviews produced a large number of constructs (507\nconstructs). It would appear that graduates are able to self-assess accurately\nwithin the work place, as there was high agreement between graduates and\nsupervisors regarding the graduates\u0027 skills and abilities.\nIn conclusion this investigation indicates that there are discrepancies between\ncourse aims and objectives and the reality of self-assessment in the educational\ncontext. Although students have the opportunity to practice self-assessment\nwithin the academic situation they are limited in their ability to self-assess\naccurately. They are, however, very confident at self-assessing within the workplace.\nThis confidence may be linked to the fact that as students self-assessments\nwas practised during the clinical component of the course. There is a need for\nfurther research with more cohorts being followed throughout the length of their\ncourse and also cohorts within other courses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Caldwell, Jennifer E.","Chesson, Rosemary"],"dc:date":"1997","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.445111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55530,"sim:weight":0.403875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.387174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.384169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.383768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108284,"sim:weight":0.371717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27452,"sim:weight":0.365922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.365855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98600,"sim:weight":0.364647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.363345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.35865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108848,"sim:weight":0.353748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.35271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227223,"sim:weight":0.339984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155556,"sim:weight":0.309997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182213,"sim:weight":0.299761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933572,"sim:weight":0.298113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.298113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.281021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9867,"sim:weight":0.275104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Britain experienced a revival of craft practice generally in 1970s’ Scotland, but this paper argues that what happened in Scotland was distinct. The tourism industry in Scotland created a demand for objects representing ‘Scottishness’, with craft objects being consumed as souvenirs. This commodification of craft was supported by Scottish funding bodies, which encouraged craft practice as small business activity. Despite attempts by organizations such as the Highlands and Islands Development Board (HIDB) to regulate the quality of craft objects and promote a more contemporary identity for them, the prevailing consumer demand was for objects that reflected a historicist version of Scotland. Examining debates within 1970s’ magazine Craftwork – Scotland\u0027s Magazine of the Crafts, as well as reports from the HIDB, this article illustrates that although tourism provided an opportunity to sustain and revitalize craft production in 1970s’ Scotland, it did little to support a more contemporary craft aesthetic.","bibo:AuthorList":["Peach, Andrea"],"dc:date":"2007-09","doi":"10.1093/jdh","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4154941,"sim:weight":0.183731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.163493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.161721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.151974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.14363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99117,"sim:weight":0.11053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.103035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109002,"sim:weight":0.100018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Yet they do so in unusual ways. Traditional entrepreneurs generate social value as a by-product of economic value; whereas for social entrepreneurs the reverse is true. This brings about an ambiguity in integrating business and social well being, most manifest in identity and in managing the enterprise. Moreover, the values which drive social enterprise are “different”. Consequently, we examine how values shape practices and how they give direction and purpose to what social enterprises do and how this shapes identity over time. Using the social organisation as the unit of analysis, we collected the narratives about tensions and how these were reconciled. We contribute by improving our understanding of social enterprise by showing how values are worked, used and deployed to give direction in reconciling ambiguity. Moreover, these ambiguities provide a unique identity and purpose for social enterprise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Diochon, Monica","Anderson, Alistair R."],"dc:date":"2011-03","doi":"10.1007/s11365-010-0161-0","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.555542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.535839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653028,"sim:weight":0.507769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100214,"sim:weight":0.434837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.226379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351681,"sim:weight":0.216129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98658,"sim:weight":0.208195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14072,"sim:weight":0.205642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.203547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.203041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98465,"sim:weight":0.197912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.183906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340561,"sim:weight":0.142308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Antibiotics used in the treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract\ninfections (UTIs), ulcer healing agents and peripheral vasodilators were selected\nfor study, thereby reflecting both acute and chronic prescribing.\nFor the UTI study, 12 randomly selected high and low prescribers of\ntrimethoprim, the recommended agent, each agreed to distribute 20 patient\nquestionnaires. Following a period of 18 months and despite repeated contact\nwith the GPs, only 89/480 (19%) questionnaires had been distributed. Patient\nresponse was, however, very high with 80 (90%) questionnaires returned. Health\noutcome measures identified that trimethoprim resulted in no or mild symptoms\nin 40/45 (91 %) of patients. These findings must be interpreted with caution due to\nthe low level of questionnaire distribution and thus cannot be extrapolated to the\ntotal population of patients. In addition, the poor questionnaire distribution did\nnot permit comparison between trimethoprim and non-recommended therapy.\nOne hundred and eighty four patients receiving repeat prescriptions for ulcer\nhealing agents were identified from one general practice. Therapy in 95 patients\ndid not adhere to formulary recommendations. Changes to therapy were\nconsidered inappropriate in 11 patients due to factors such as severe depression and a further 8 were deemed unsuitable for participation for non-clinical reasons.\nThe remaining 76 patients were contacted with 19 (25%) refusing to participate.\nFifty seven patients were interviewed using the Glasgow Dyspepsia Severity\nScore and Short Form 36 (SF-36). Changes in health outcomes were measured for\n21 patients where a change in therapy had taken place. These results were\ndifficult to interpret due to the diversity of changes recommended and the lack of\ndata relating to those patients not participating.\nWork involving peripheral vasodilators aimed to determine the effect on health\noutcomes of cessation of therapy. Forty five patients receiving these agents in 2\npractices were identified, although 8 had not requested a prescription in the\nprevious year. Two further patients were excluded from the study due to cancer\nand old age. The remaining 35 agreed to be interviewed using the Walking\nImpairment Questionnaire and SF-36. All patients were subsequently instructed\nto stop therapy for 2 months, although 6 (17%) refused to follow this instruction,\none patient was seriously ill thus was excluded and 3 refused to be reinterviewed.\nOf the remaining 25 patients, no significant differences were\nobserved in the domains studied. Seventeen patients (68%) expressed no desire to\nrestart therapy, generating considerable savings. These results must be interpreted\nwith caution since those not stopping therapy or refusing re-interview are likely\nto have responded differently to those completing the study.\nThe measurement of health outcomes following formulary implementation\ndeserves further work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stewart, Derek C.","Krska, Janet","Kendle, Keith"],"dc:date":"1998-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.397688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.324423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448025,"sim:weight":0.296806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185982,"sim:weight":0.295438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.295408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.283523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316148,"sim:weight":0.280348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.271854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.251101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2753332,"sim:weight":0.236605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8747712,"sim:weight":0.235422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.229399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99453,"sim:weight":0.22895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85277,"sim:weight":0.197298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98998,"sim:weight":0.179886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

All his essay did was confirm his lack of\ncontemporary knowledge and his anachronistic view of what ceramics could be.\nIn the intervening years, critics of the crafts might well have responded to the\nquestion in the following terms …\nToday’s craft represents an unsustainable model of practice. Craft workers\nsurvive on poverty wages and indulge in unsafe working practices – often\necologically unsound, using potentially toxic materials and procedures,\nfundamentally inefficient, relying on extremely limited levels of output, unwilling to\nadopt new ways of working. Their designs are often lacking, using the excuse of\na rustic aesthetic to justify poor levels of functionality. Modern craft workers are\npredominantly middle class individuals indulging in an expensive pastime\nproducing vast amounts of unwanted objects d’art …\nThis paper attempts to address the potentially damning criticism of contemporary\ncraft expressed in the previous paragraph. If this criticism were correct it would\nbe hard to justify continuing to educate new craft makers. The recent decline in\nsingle subject specialist craft courses in the UK may be explained if the\nperception of contemporary craft matches the criticism above. The paper defines\ncraft connexity in terms of a networking of socially engaged contemporary craft\npractice. The concept of “intelligent making” is examined. It will propose new\nmodels of craft practice, operating through sustainable environmentally sensitive\nworking methods and materials. The model describes craft makers who are\naesthetically aware, IT literate, sometimes acting as social critics and capable of\ndeveloping new design concepts. The paper sets out the essential ingredients\nfor a modern craft curriculum, which includes research skills, sustainable design\npractice, collaborative design practice, critical awareness, IT skills and business\nmanagement.\nThe practice of craft has moved on since Julian’s first attempt to respond to the\nquestion of whether or not craft is an anachronism. It is now time to re-examine\nand challenge the value of craft education. The authors propose a more\nsustainable model of craft education and practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Malins, Julian Paul","Press, Mike","McKillop, Chris","Burnett, Gordon"],"dc:date":"2004-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4162458,"sim:weight":0.1971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.195342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.192689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.185499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.178459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.167791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.166644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85785,"sim:weight":0.164968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.159067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.156147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160882,"sim:weight":0.148649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The main aim of the study was to examine collaborative goalsetting as a\nmeans of (a) involving people with learning disabilities in healthcare decision making\nand (b) measuring the impact of treatment interventions.\nStudy Design: Initially a qualitative approach was taken. Case study methods centred\non the introduction of Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) as an individualised measure of\noutcome within two acute specialist in-patient units. Views of co-operative care\nplanning and evaluation were elicited from patients and clinicians through the use of\nGAS. A unique patient interview schedule was developed incorporating pictures as a\nsupplementary method of establishing users\u0027 views. Following this a two-phase\ninterview survey included views of care from eight practitioners and 10 managers and\nservice commissioners. Finally a survey of 94 key stakeholders within Scottish learning\ndisabilities services was undertaken.\nFindings: Practitioners had difficulties implementing GAS. Twelve patients were\nselected for the GAS study by members of the multidisciplinary team. In total 16 goals\nwere set and scaled and impact measured. Six patients participated in interviews,\ndescribing the users\u0027 view of the therapeutic process. The findings highlighted barriers\nto the inclusion of people with learning disabilities such as rapid discharge, extreme\nbehaviour and severe learning disabilities. In all surveys outcome measurement was\nviewed as complex as well as open to manipulation. A consistent preference for\nindividualised measures of outcome for people with learning disabilities emerged.

Women\u0027s correspondence to Aberdeen daily newspapers, 1900-1918.","bibo:abstract":"This research provides an insight into the motivations and agenda of women correspondents to\nAberdeen local newspapers during the period 1900-18. This was achieved by undertaking a\ncontent analysis of all printed letters to the editor identified as being by women correspondents to\nthe Aberdeen Daily Journal and Aberdeen Free Press. Women correspondents were identified by\ntheir signatures, feminine noms de plume or the content of their letters. Whilst it is accepted that\nthis method must of necessity have excluded some women correspondents who did not wish to\nreveal their gender, this research focused exclusively on correspondents who were willing to be\nidentified as female in their correspondence to the newspapers. In this way, it was hoped to\nidentify the issues which impelled women out of their domestic and private sphere and into the\nmore public sphere of newspaper debate.\nThe two Aberdeen newspapers were also well suited for this research because of their lack of\neditorial gatekeeping, with little censorship of letters discerned, even in wartime. However, a lack\nof editorial censorship did not mean that women correspondents faced no barriers to the\npublication of their opinions in the newspapers. Women correspondents had to overcome social\nconventions, including possibly the disapproval of friends and family, in order to enter the world\nof public debate.\nThe research identified particular issues about which it was acceptable for women to correspond\nto the newspapers and particular women who were allowed to debate these issues. Middle-class\nwomen engaged in philanthropic and charitable work, especially that related to women and\nchildren or, during the First World War, the war effort, felt justified in writing to the newspapers\nin order to publicise such activities. Women also justified correspondence to the newspapers on\ncertain matters by claiming that they came under woman\u0027s jurisdiction in the domestic sphere.\nMany women further justified their correspondence on such matters by using pen names which\nemphasised their domestic and maternal role, such as `Mother\u0027 or `Wife\u0027. Such correspondence\ntended to be proactive rather than reactive to other material in the newspapers, which is in direct\ncontrast to the findings of previous researchers into the motivation of newspaper correspondents.\nInterestingly, the research discovered that women correspondents\u0027 use of noms de plume\nincreased from 1900 until the outbreak of the First World War. While some women used pen\nnames to emphasise their familial role, others used them in a much more straightforward way - in\norder to protect their identity while writing on contentious subjects. Such subjects included\ncontroversial issues such as woman suffrage and the sexual double standards of early 2e century\nBritain. However, even the most militant suffragette justified her demand for a vote by\nemphasising woman\u0027s difference from man. Such correspondents preferred to enlarge the\nwoman\u0027s sphere to include social commentary and electoral privilege rather than step outside it\naltogether.\nThe research also investigated differences between the two newspapers and between pre-war and\nwartime correspondence. It is suggested that the Daily Journal attracted more letters from\n`domestic\u0027 women on issues related to a more narrowly defined `woman\u0027s sphere\u0027 while the Free\nPress\u0027s correspondents included more New Women. In addition, the Journal received more\nletters from women based in England or further afield, for example the colonies, while the Free\nPress tended to receive letters from women within Scotland. Women\u0027s wartime correspondence\nwas dominated by the war effort, which swept most other topics of correspondence off the letters\npages, although the later years of the war saw an increase in letters of complaint, usually aimed at\nincreasing bureaucracy and again making use of familial pen names.\nSuch findings contribute to the broader history of the media and women\u0027s studies in the northeast\nof Scotland, and indicate a broadening and nationalising of interest throughout the early 20th\ncentury, and the beginning of an accompanying weakening of local, regional links.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pedersen, Sarah","Smith, Myrtle Anderson","Head, Michael","Reid, Peter H."],"dc:date":"2004-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":385375,"sim:weight":0.425288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108193,"sim:weight":0.41513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316097,"sim:weight":0.394215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316067,"sim:weight":0.386287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.36647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.309747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":315976,"sim:weight":0.292875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.292803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447795,"sim:weight":0.292761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.285374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316073,"sim:weight":0.278591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108988,"sim:weight":0.27703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51463,"sim:weight":0.273107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.269945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316094,"sim:weight":0.237602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316125,"sim:weight":0.226144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Information is provided on topics such as training, technical and administrative requirements, and the issues to address, whether adopting a local, institutional, approach or participating in a national level service.","bibo:AuthorList":["Copeland, Susan"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.2304/pfie.2008.6.1.87","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":36649,"sim:weight":0.276853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9322815,"sim:weight":0.253641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.251494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.241581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162458,"sim:weight":0.224999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60055,"sim:weight":0.221973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.219805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.188658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.185647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67149,"sim:weight":0.185428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933664,"sim:weight":0.18311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158997,"sim:weight":0.1823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931120,"sim:weight":0.172521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15592,"sim:weight":0.167694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384858,"sim:weight":0.167296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It also considers the nature and role of trust in\nsuch relationships.\nOver the last fifteen years companies in the UK oil and gas industry have been\ncollaborating to enhance the sustainability of the industry. They have perceived\nsome of the collaborative relationships to have been highly successful whereas\nothers have been considered as failures. However, there is little firm evidence on\nwhat factors relate to success and failure or how success and failure have been\ndefined.\nThe thesis discusses the special features of the collaborative relationships in the\nindustry and the difficulty of developing a precise definition for them or for their\nsuccess. It is also recognised that some factors can be seen as critical to success but\nthat their presence may also be seen as an indicator of success, and this potential\ncircularity is discussed within the thesis.\nThe first phase of the research was undertaken in September 1999 to find out the\ndistinguishing features of alliancing and partnering and the factors that have been\nassociated with their success and failure. Using a self-administered questionnaire,\nmostly qualitative free-text data were collected from a sample drawn randomly from\nthree different sets of people associated with the industry. Information was extracted\nfrom the qualitative data through content analysis.\nThe first phase indicated that, in general, performance level i. e. achievement of goals\nexpressed in terms of cost saving, time, and safety level; sharing risks and rewards;\nand acquiring more business is the broadly used criterion for measuring success or\nfailure of alliances in the industry. Presence of trust was found to be the most\nimportant factor for enabling success of an alliance and it was followed by shared\nand aligned goals, open behaviour, shared knowledge, clear role, commitment of\nmembers, co-operative behaviour and honesty. Factors which often cause failure are\nabsence of shared, aligned and clear goals, absence of trusting attitude, absence of\nopen communication, presence of un-addressed cultural differences, and absence of\nstrong proactive leadership.\nThe second phase of the study was undertaken because both the literature and the\nresults of the first phase identified presence of trust as a very important success\nfactor in collaborative relationships. Its aim was to understand peoples\u0027 perception of\ntrust and its role in collaborative relationships with the following research questions:\n\"What do people mean when they speak or think about trust in the industry? \", \"What\nare the effects of presence of trust in collaborative relationships? \" and \"What needs\nto be done to maintain trust in relationships? \"\nData for the second phase was collected in July 2001 from five collaborative\nrelationships, involving 21 companies from the upstream oil and gas industry,\nthrough a questionnaire survey and appropriate statistical methods were used to\nanalyse the data. The findings suggest that people give high priority to the following\ntypes of trust; contractual trust, competence trust, process-based trust, strong form of\ntrust and cognitive trust. The findings also suggest a method for dividing people into\nthose with trusting attitudes and those with non-trusting attitudes.\nThe second phase used factors identified in the first phase to attempt to measure\nperceived levels of trust and perceived levels of success in the relationships of the\npeople surveyed. A strong positive link between the perceived level of trust in an\nalliance and its perceived success was identified from the data.\nThe thesis includes a review of the research process used and reflects on lessons\nlearned and improvements which could have been made. Areas for further research\nwhich build on the work in this thesis are suggested.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haque, S. M.

It extends Marchionini\u0027s eight stage model\nof information seeking, geared towards electronic environments, to holistically encompass the\nphysical, cognitive, affective and social dimensions of Web users\u0027 behaviour.\nThe study recognises the uniqueness of the Web environment as a vehicle for information\ndissemination and retrieval, drawing on the distinction between information searching and\ninformation seeking and emphasises the importance of following user-centred holistic\napproaches to study information seeking behaviour. It reviews the research in the field and\ndemonstrates that there is no comprehensive model that explains the behaviour of Web users\nwhen employing search engines for information retrieval. The methods followed to develop\nthe study are explained with a detailed analysis of the four dimensions of information seeking\n(physical, cognitive affective, social). Emphasis is placed on the significance of combined\nmethods (qualitative and quantitative) and the ways in which they can enrich the examination\nof human behaviour. This is concluded with a discussion of methodological issues.\nThe study is supported by an empirical investigation, which examines the relationship\nbetween interactive information retrieval using Web search engines and human information seeking\nprocesses. This investigates the influence of cognitive elements (such as learning and\nproblem style, and creative ability) and affective characteristics (e. g. confidence, loyalty,\nfamiliarity, ease of use), as well as the role that system experience, domain knowledge and\ndemographics play in information seeking behaviour and in user overall satisfaction with the\nretrieval result. The influence of these factors is analysed by identifying users\u0027 patterns of\nbehaviour and tactics, adopted to solve specific problems.\nThe findings of the empirical study are incorporated into an enriched information-seeking\nmodel, encompassing use of search engines, which reveals a complex interplay between\nphysical, cognitive, affective and social elements and that none of these characteristics can be\nseen in isolation when attempting to explain the complex phenomenon of information seeking\nbehaviour. Although the model is presented in a linear fashion the dynamic, reiterative and\ncircular character of the information seeking process is explained through an emphasis on\ntransition patterns between the different stages.\nThe research concludes with a discussion of problems encountered by Web information\nseekers which provides detailed analysis of the reasons why users express satisfaction or\ndissatisfaction with the results of Web searching, areas in which Web search engines can be\nimproved and issues related to the need for students to be given additional training and support\nare identified. These include planning and organising information, recognising different\ndimensions of information intents and needs, emphasising the importance of variety in Web\ninformation seeking, promoting effective formulation of queries and ranking, reducing\noverload of information and assisting effective selection of Web sites and critical examination\nof results.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martzoukou, Konstantina","Newton, Robert","Harper, David J.","Reid, Peter H."],"dc:date":"2006-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.364541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184248,"sim:weight":0.313237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.25194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.240431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.230027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56680,"sim:weight":0.222148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.204267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183850,"sim:weight":0.197951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.197155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Reinforced by\nchildhood memories of timber buildings in other locations, the idea turned into an ironic quest\nfor a Lost Tradition of Timber buildings in North East Scotland.\nThe fieldwork provides both substantive and extensive material with 198 records of extant\nbuildings, and archival research having produced evidence of 156 others. However, in a field\ncharacterised by transience and lack of documentation, this total cannot be considered\ndefinitive.\nWhilst the study presents a significant body of information about a Victorian interest in timber\nframe building not previously identified in the literature, the lack of any previous research in\nthis area means that the work represents a phenomenon which is isolated both historically and\nculturally.\nThe study adopts a taxonomic methodology and a selection of case studies offers a\ncomparative analysis in which frame typologies and their characteristics are examined. The\ngeographical area is illustrated in map 1 fieldwork buildings distribution map. This is\nstructured on 10km transects and individual buildings identified numerically in a north to\nsouth sequence within these transects.\nFieldwork specimens represent a diversity of both buildings and frame types, and the\nextensive use of timber buildings by the railway companies demonstrates they merely\nexploited an already established capability and knowledge for timber building and were not\nresponsible for its introduction into the geographical area of study. It is clear that the majority\nof the fieldwork examples are of building types that would have been `modern\u0027 to the late 19th\ncentury with only dwellings, church buildings and mills having historic precedence. This\naspect introduces the enigma of the antecedents of their construction methods, particularly in\nview of the parsimony of the contemporaneous literature.\nA total of four differing frame types have been identified and a previously unrecorded post\nand rail system is represented across all building types.

However, the high\ncomputational complexity of H. 264/AVC is a problem for codecs running on low-power\nhand held devices and general purpose computers. This thesis presents new techniques to\nreduce, control and manage the computational complexity of an H. 264/AVC codec.\nA new complexity reduction algorithm for H. 264/AVC is developed. This algorithm\npredicts \"skipped\" macroblocks prior to motion estimation by estimating a Lagrange ratedistortion\ncost function. Complexity savings are achieved by not processing the\nmacroblocks that are predicted as \"skipped\". The Lagrange multiplier is adaptively\nmodelled as a function of the quantisation parameter and video sequence statistics.\nSimulation results show that this algorithm achieves significant complexity savings with\na negligible loss in rate-distortion performance.\nThe complexity reduction algorithm is further developed to achieve complexity-scalable\ncontrol of the encoding process. The Lagrangian cost estimation is extended to\nincorporate computational complexity. A target level of complexity is maintained by\nusing a feedback algorithm to update the Lagrange multiplier associated with complexity.\nResults indicate that scalable complexity control of the encoding process can be achieved\nwhilst maintaining near optimal complexity-rate-distortion performance.\nA complexity management framework is proposed for maximising the perceptual quality\nof coded video in a real-time processing-power constrained environment. A real-time\nframe-level control algorithm and a per-frame complexity control algorithm are combined\nin order to manage the encoding process such that a high frame rate is maintained without\nsignificantly losing frame quality. Subjective evaluations show that the managed\ncomplexity approach results in higher perceptual quality compared to a reference encoder\nthat drops frames in computationally constrained situations.\nThese novel algorithms are likely to be useful in implementing real-time H. 264/AVC\nstandard encoders in computationally constrained environments such as low-power\nmobile devices and general purpose computers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kannangara, Chaminda Sampath","Richardson, Iain","Zhao, Yafan","Miller, Tony"],"dc:date":"2006-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":340552,"sim:weight":0.419666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185160,"sim:weight":0.326373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998353,"sim:weight":0.243992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998410,"sim:weight":0.223307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8748539,"sim:weight":0.222809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998219,"sim:weight":0.219791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998369,"sim:weight":0.216048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91536,"sim:weight":0.212846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998010,"sim:weight":0.21128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998077,"sim:weight":0.199581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930408,"sim:weight":0.186315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999730,"sim:weight":0.183349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":899509,"sim:weight":0.173515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998078,"sim:weight":0.16575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930535,"sim:weight":0.143575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931965,"sim:weight":0.137185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997773,"sim:weight":0.122833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931258,"sim:weight":0.121864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934810,"sim:weight":0.114452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":1576844,"ep:Repository":84,"dc:type":["Thesis or dissertation","Doctoral","PhD"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Understanding the entrepreneur as socially constructed.","bibo:abstract":"The objective of this thesis, which combines two levels of analysis, is to explore the entrepreneur\nas a social construct and the socially constructed nature of entrepreneurship. It builds upon a\nlimited number of extant studies considering the socially constructed nature of entrepreneurship\nby focusing upon achieving a Verstehen\u0027 of these \u0027constructions\u0027 as articulated in stories;\nthereby enhancing conceptual understanding. It achieves this by concentrating upon the key\nissues of constructionism, namely narrative and identity; and by triangulating these by using a\nqualitative approach and a variety of methodologies. These include social constructionism,\nsemiotic analysis, biographical analysis, in-depth interviews, content analysis and action\nresearch. This approach is justified because, despite an increasing body of research into aspects\nentrepreneurial, our basic understanding of the many social facets which influence our perception\nof the entrepreneur remains unclear. Clarity of definition often eludes us, although we can\ndescribe and explain it in context. Consequentially, such constructions are subjective, descriptive,\noften nebulous and heavily reliant upon stereotype. By examining interrelated social constructs\nsuch as gender, class and ethnicity, which are embedded in and influenced by other constructs\nsuch as childhood, family, society, culture and so on this thesis extends our knowledge of\nentrepreneurial process. It allows us to understand subjective issues such as ethics, value,\nmorality, legitimacy, traits, character and personality which become visible when articulated via\nnarrative forms and storytelling mechanisms of myth, metaphor and fable.\nThe findings suggest that our perception of entrepreneurs may owe more to narrative\nconvention than to the lived experience of entrepreneurs. The review of academic literature,\nnovels (fiction), biographies, autobiographies, newspaper articles, and a semiotic analysis of\nimages and photographs associated with the entrepreneur found that although entrepreneurs are\neulogised, not all practice moral entrepreneurship - thus signalling the many forms and functions\nof entrepreneurship, including the immoral, amoral and criminal. In identifying a universal\nstorybook formula the thesis shows how entrepreneurial practice is influenced by heroic\nstereotyping and how entrepreneurship can be understood as a communicational construct; a\nliving, evolving narrative; and enacted story. This formula spans different media with a\nconsistency of themes and elements which demonstrates its socially constructed nature. The\nmulti-methodology allows one to develop deeper understanding.\nThe contribution of this thesis is the exploration of the philosophical, ideological and epistemological\nissues underpinning the ontology of entrepreneurship. This thesis by adapting a process of deconstructionism,\nanalysis and reconstruction contributes by adopting a holistic approach uniting the\nconstructionist and Verstehen\u0027 approaches as a heuristic tool through which to achieve a greater\nunderstanding of entrepreneurship as a socio-behavioural process. Moreover it considers entrepreneurial\nnarrative as socially mediated behavioural scripts constructed from a wide range of inter-disciplinary knowledge best understood when assembled and read as a process. In taking cognisance of the individual\nentrepreneur as a person and in then examining psychological, sociological, demographic and linguistic\nfactors affecting the application of entrepreneurship, the thesis maps entrepreneurial process as socially\nconstructed. Mapping how social constructionism shapes perception necessitates looking at the\npractices and processes which constitute it as a socially negotiated interaction.\nThis thesis extends knowledge of how social constructions are formed and perpetuated in society and\ndisplays originality by focusing on how social construction impact on the entrepreneurial process. The\nentrepreneur is often encountered in a literary format as a heroic male personage. Masculine ideology,\nrhetoric, mythology, and doxa reinforce this message marginalising female entrepreneurs with whom the\nconstruction may not resonate. Entrepreneurs are presented as \u0027likeable rogues\u0027 a perception reinforced by\na semiotic pictorial format of \u0027bad boys\u0027 embedded in images of masculinity, class and criminality. This thesis\nbridges many theoretical approaches to entrepreneurship by using narrative and communication techniques\nto reveal how academic conceptualisations adhere to but differ from more popular concepts. The research\ndevelops a practical narrative based theory of entrepreneurship. This study presents the socially constructed\nnature of entrepreneurial knowledge and process in a way not done before. However, its most substantial\ncontribution is that it takes the notion of entrepreneurial narrative, discourse, and constructions to a new\nlevel in taking cognisance of the plethora of plots, sub-plots and storylines which constitute the socially\nconstructed narrative that is entrepreneurship.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert","Anderson, Alistair R.","Drakopoulou-Dodd, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2006-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108223,"sim:weight":0.288681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.280834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.266863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.233165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.227446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.205948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.20523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.195438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using an iterative approach and drawing upon a number of different methodologies the\nthesis attempts to evaluate the development potential of tidal current energy in terms of the\nresource and identify the potential environmental impacts. In addition, it attempts to identify the\nbarriers to development that may be preventing the growth of the industry. The thesis also\nassesses further research requirements in terms of environmental and social barriers to\ndevelopment, focusing on an environmental impact methodology and its importance in tidal\ncurrent energy development.\nOver recent years there has been a significant acceleration in tidal current energy research and\ndevelopment. The key challenge is for technologies to reach full commercialisation. The thesis\ninvestigates present market and industrial accessibility and due to institutional and\nenvironmental barriers, concludes that commerciality will be hard to achieve if such \u0027barriers\u0027\nare not broken. However, the skills and capability base in the UK offshore industry and indeed\nthe renewable energy sector is significant and this should be utilised accordingly. This vision of\ncommercialisation needs to be sustained and a culture of forward thinking needs to be\ncontinuously cultivated. In essence, the UK cannot afford to miss this opportunity, both in terms\nof R\u0026D status, economic stability, energy diversity and security of supply and in time export\npotential.\nThe thesis identifies key environmental issues concerning tidal current energy development\nusing a site-specific case study and highlights the misconception that renewable energies are\nwithout environmental impact. It is clear that some are well understood within the realm of\nother offshore industries, however, some are relatively unique to this type of development and\nthe need for further research is evident in these areas, in order to dispel the environmental\nimpact uncertainties that exist.

Emotions of ITN s are exposed to stressors that may lead to emotional\nchanges. This study aimed to explore the emotional changes experienced by Jordanian\nITN s. Multiple triangulation was employed in three interrelated phases. Each phase is a\npre-requisite for the next. All phases complete each other to form the whole study. The\nfirst phase used observations and interviews to collect data from three ITNs working in\nthree different Intensive Therapy Units (ITUs), the adult intensive therapy, the paediatric\nintensive therapy and the post-cardiac surgery units. The first phase revealed the range of\nemotions experienced by ITN s.\nThe second phase involved a construction of self-reporting questionnaire based on the first\nphase findings. The aim of the questionnaire phase was to identify the nurses\u0027 highly\nmeaningful emotions within the ITU s. A total of 73 ITN s responded from three different\nhospitals. The second phase revealed 50 out of 172 emotional items as highly meaningful\nemotions. The highly meaningful emotions were categorised into five emotional groups:\nmutual professional, disparagement, self-worth and physical emotions. The situations (in\nwhich the emotions were revealed) of the second phase were categorised into five themes:\ntechnology, advanced nursing procedures, nurse-patient relationship, nurse-human\nrelationship, and working conditions.\nIt was necessary to conduct a third phase in order to allow in-depth understanding of the\nphenomenon of emotional changes within ITN s. The third phase employed interviews\nwith nine participants using an interview guide. The third phase analysis showed that the\nemotional groups had different patterns of emotional transformations. Mutual\ndisparagement emotions showed an increase in emotionality followed by a decrease until\nthey reached a balanced stage. Professional and self-worth emotions were increasing over\ntime for ITNs.\nThe study proposed a model of expertism within ITN s. Expertism according to the current\nstudy is a process of emotional transformations. Knowledge, experience and culture\ntraining would help ITNs to transform their emotions to reach a level of expertism.\nCulture and gender differences may also influence ITNs\u0027 emotional transformations. ITNs\nbecome balanced in their mutuality and disparagement, and having high professionality\nand self-worth. These expert ITNs would attain advanced nursing qualities such as: being\norganised, autonomous, critical thinker, and educators.\nEmotional transformation is a process that could be taught to ITNs. Nurse educators could\nuse the model to develop courses and programmes which could foster the emotional\ntransformations within ITN s in order to reach the expertism. Such courses and\nprogrammes are expected to reduce turnover and burnout among ITN s and foster nursing\nprofessionalism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Almahrouk, Mohammed","Gass, John","Shukri, Raghra","Richie, Manny"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1651882,"sim:weight":0.253527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.216539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54706,"sim:weight":0.214653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.210478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.192921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.182714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59081,"sim:weight":0.168849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653231,"sim:weight":0.166921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22782,"sim:weight":0.163029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385794,"sim:weight":0.163013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.153952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.152688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.145307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.143065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98998,"sim:weight":0.12998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The following thesis aims at mapping out the\nstrategic behaviour of small firms in the small island state of Malta, and in relating the\nevident patterns of strategic behaviour to the performances of these firms.\nThe thesis follows on the logic of understanding strategy as a dynamic phenomenon, one\nthat can be viewed as pathways between identifiable life cycle states. It also views\nstrategy as behaviour, part deliberate and part emergent, thus allowing for the inclusion of\nboth external influences and internal decision making. To be able to achieve this dynamic\nviewpoint of strategy a particular research methodology had to be deployed, observing\nboth the context and the consequences to a firm’s strategic actions, as well as the very\nactions and interactions themselves. A Grounded Theory method of enquiry was adopted\nfor this purpose as it is ideal for observing patterns, the very theme of this thesis.\nThe research in question has focused on small firms with up to 49 full time employees, in\nline with the E.U.’s definition of both micro and small firms, and in a broad range of\nindustries in Malta. Results confirmed the predominance of five trajectories, or pathways,\nof small business strategic behaviour, each passing through a sequence of distinct life\ncycle states.

The use of these fuels has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.\nThere is a need for a more localised and sustainable energy source to meet the demands of our\ncities. Renewable energy is now being considered as a realistic contributor to both our energy\nand environmental problems.\nThe contribution of small – scale distributed power generation from renewable sources to the\nScottish energy mix is examined. The daily potential energy available from wind and solar\nresources will be modelled using spectral techniques such as Wavelets and Fourier analysis.\nFrom this, synthetic time series of the energy available will be created based on the\ncharacteristics of real life data. Along with this, a simple model for both the electricity and\nheating energy consumption of a typical domestic building is proposed. This allows for the\napproximation of daily domestic consumption values from monthly average energy values.\nThe potential energy available is then compared with the estimated domestic energy\nconsumption. The loads best suited for, and met by PV generating systems and wind systems\nwill also be assessed, along with the proportion of time that the domestic demand is met or\nexceeded. This work will be backed up with realistic examples from building integrated\nrenewable systems based on typical data for Aberdeen. All this would allow for a potential\nstatistical relationship between energy supply and demand to be developed in the future.\nThe results of the analysis allowed for the estimation of the potential wind and PV system sizes\nrequired to match either the typical summer or winter domestic demand. From these sizes, it\nwas concluded that a combination of a 5m2 PV system and a 1.5kW wind turbine was required\nto match the typical domestic base load. Widespread implementation of these combined\nsystems, on suitable dwellings, could provide a 16% contribution to the Scottish domestic\nelectricity demand.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fowler, Ailsa Mhairi","Owen, Alan","Bryden, Ian","Robertson, Peter K.

{"identifier":1576870,"ep:Repository":84,"dc:type":["Thesis or dissertation","Doctoral","PhD"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Effective communication with people with learning disabilities with epilepsy and their carers.","bibo:abstract":"People with learning disabilities constitute about 2% of the general population. Epilepsy is more prevalent among people with learning disabilities compared with the general population. Effective communication is central to the management of people with learning disabilities and epilepsy. It has both therapeutic and health promotion functions including psycho-social benefits to the individual and their carers. Carers play vital roles in supporting individuals who live in the community to manage their conditions and the need for effective communication between service users and health care professionals is crucially important. Effective communication may not only lead to improved quality of life but may reduce mortality through the promotion of better understanding of seizures and encouraging efficient use of medication.\nDespite this communication regarding community-based adults with mild learning disabilities has not been fully studied, in particular the service users‘ views and experiences regarding communication has been a neglected area. Yet, the service users‘ views may be the best source for the definition of effective communication. This study was triggered by the paucity of research that investigated service users‘ views and experiences regarding communication. Furthermore, numerous health policies have been formulated that emphasise the involvement of patients as consumers in the provision and delivery of health services. This study is purported to bridge this communication gap by offering service users a rare opportunity for them to express their views and experiences regarding communication to inform health policies and clinical practice.\nThis study adopts a naturalistic qualitative approach and employs in-depth semi-structured interviews to solicit service users‘ and their carers‘ views and experiences regarding communication. The interviews also investigated service users‘ and carers‘ perspectives in regard to communication with health care professionals‘. Carer communication diaries were used to supplement the carers‘ interview data and also to endorse the credibility of the study findings.\nSix main findings emerged from this study that described service users‘ and carers‘ views and experiences regarding communication: communication needs and expectations; ‗engagement‘ as a predictor of effective communication; strategies of communication; facilitating factors of communication; methods of communication; barriers to communication.\nThis study suggests that effective communication with people with learning disabilities and epilepsy requires a reflective model that incorporates self-assessment and awareness of the individual‘s communication needs and expectations. The model and recommendations that emerged from this study may be a useful resource for health and social care professionals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ninnoni, Jerry Paul K.","Chesson, Rosemary","Wilcock, Sylvia","Young, Anita"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4161599,"sim:weight":0.413429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4152433,"sim:weight":0.394079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.361071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.350518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.337648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271231,"sim:weight":0.324496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.317539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.307366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.303519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.29474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998639,"sim:weight":0.281045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.25128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.225099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158609,"sim:weight":0.22339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57264,"sim:weight":0.222444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.217562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.205456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99137,"sim:weight":0.182614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Adopting a narrative methodology based upon the literary hermeneutic of Paul Ricoeur, this thesis is presented as a ‘narrative research text’ in which my own role as a narrative researcher is critically developed. Utilising two different narrative frameworks, narratives are ‘constructed’ from data drawn from the research methods of focus groups, one-to-one interviews, reflective practice journals and documentary sources. \nContemporary approaches in professional health care ethics education tend to share features of deduction, universality and generalisability. Their merits notwithstanding, perspectives drawn from the arts and humanities can offer valid critiques and alternative perspectives. Reading literature and poetry is offered as an engaged and interpretive contribution to a teleological ethic characterised by attention to ends (e.g. human flourishing), cultivation of virtue, telling of narrative, recognising relationality and in acknowledging the significance of contextual factors. These perspectives can all contribute to an ‘eclectic’ approach to ethics education in nursing. \nThese narratives of student nurses support the careful inclusion of the arts and humanities within nurse education curricula for their potential to encourage self-awareness, critical thinking and concern for others. Narratives of nurse educators support these insights in addition to demonstrating ways in which the arts and humanities themselves can offer critical perspectives on current curriculum philosophies.\nThese narratives suggest that the reading of literature and poetry can contribute to an eclectic approach to ‘ethical competency’ in nurse education. This is a broad-based educational approach which draws upon shared interpretive dimensions of the arts and humanities via engagement, action and response. This thesis contributes to current literature in the field of professional health care education by demonstrating the significance of findings derived from inclusion of a teleological ethic within ethics education.","bibo:AuthorList":["McKie, Andrew","West, Bernice J.

As they become more dependent on tourism for their growth, they are more concerned with improving their competitiveness to adapt to a highly charged competitive environment and to the dynamic market conditions. The quintessential problem is how to achieve, maintain, and enhance competitiveness. There is limited research on tourism destination competitiveness (TDC), and much less on small island destinations. This study concentrates on TDC with a special focus on Malta as a small Mediterranean island in an attempt to develop a comprehensive TDC framework that is useful to small island destinations, and advances models and measures to assess competitiveness based on importance-performance analysis techniques (IPA). To achieve its research objectives, this study adopts a methodological position reflecting pragmatist assumptions and uses a sequential, exploratory, Mixed Methods design strategy. In the qualitative first phase of the design, thirty-five in-depth interviews are conducted with key ‘experts’ in tourism. It emerges from the participants’ description that sixty tourism-specific and business-related determinants provide a broad framework for assessing TDC. In the second phase, survey research is applied in order to develop quantitative measures to reveal the relative importance of the competitiveness factors, to assess the performance of the destination on these factors, and to identify priority areas that require immediate attention for improvement. Statistical measures and procedures are modified, introduced, and tested to establish a valid model for measuring TDC. Results show that the diagonal approach and the adjusted weighted partial ranking method for measuring importance and performance are the best combination that satisfies validity criteria. When applying these techniques to assess Malta’s competitiveness relative to a competing set of Mediterranean destinations, twelve tourism attributes and fourteen business-related factors are identified as priority areas for improvement, with the competitiveness deficiency gaps in business factors being notably higher than those in tourism-specific areas. This study has several implications for the development of TDC theory, methods, and application to small islands. It provides tourism researchers, policymakers, and practitioners with a theoretically robust framework that can assist them in the formulation of policies, the management of the destination, and the implementation of strategies to optimise resource allocation in order to enhance a destination’s competitive position. Given that there are few studies that focus on the development and measurement of TDC models for small islands, this study makes a valid contribution to knowledge. The methodological approaches adopted in this inquiry have substantive application in IPA studies both within and beyond tourism studies. The study’s outcomes are also transferable to small island destinations operating in similar environments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Azzopardi, Ernest","Donaldson, Bill","Nash, Robert"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":386779,"sim:weight":0.490667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61142,"sim:weight":0.444666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.341568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183850,"sim:weight":0.244519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.228392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.20836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.176385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.176238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50121,"sim:weight":0.154633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.12158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Contrary to\nmost traditional ILP learning problems, biological sequences often have a high variation\nin their length. This variation in length is an important feature of biological sequences\nwhich should not be ignored by ILP systems. However we have identified that some ILP\nsystems do not take into account the length of examples when evaluating their proposed\nhypotheses.\nDuring the learning process, many ILP systems use clause evaluation functions to\nassign a score to induced hypotheses, estimating their quality and effectively influencing\nthe search. Traditionally, clause evaluation functions do not take into account the length\nof the examples which are covered by the clause. We propose L-modification, a way of\nmodifying existing clause evaluation functions so that they take into account the length\nof the examples which they learn from.\nAn empirical study was undertaken to investigate if significant improvements can be\nachieved by applying L-modification to a standard clause evaluation function.

This was intended to collect data that describe processes and also to elicit information about the reasons for these processes. The authors set the study in the context of a developing country. \n\nFindings – It was found that information and knowledge is key to the operational success of these companies. Knowledge, and its application, is crucial to their competitive advantage. The companies have developed very useful internal systems for sharing information. They also have efficient methods for tapping into existing external knowledge. However, evidence was also found of immature national information sharing systems. The authors attribute this to the level of development in Tunisia and to the understandable attitudes of the firm owners. \n\nResearch limitations/implications – Whilst unable to generalise empirically beyond these cases, the authors can conceptually generalise that these processes are likely to be common in similar national contexts. The implication is then that developing countries such as Tunisia may need to invest more in creating knowledge hubs. \n\nOriginality/value – The paper contributes by describing knowledge sharing in a less well-researched area.

We argue that the social conditions of entrepreneurs, as well as the social nature of opportunities, affect the entrepreneurial process. Accordingly this paper examines the enactment of a very socialised opportunity to explore the various roles played out in entrepreneurial growth. We find that a conceptualisation of the social value created in the process furthers our understanding. This is opposed to focusing on economic growth as the sole relevant outcome,\nOur case study shows how social value is created in multiple forms at different centres and on different levels; from individual self-realization over community development to broad societal impact. We also find complex interrelations between the different levels and centres, thus we argue that entrepreneurship is as much a social as an economic phenomenon.","bibo:AuthorList":["Korsgaard, Steffen","Anderson, Alistair R."],"dc:date":"2011-04","doi":"10.1177/0266242610391936","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1555542,"sim:weight":0.53326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555634,"sim:weight":0.512346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539634,"sim:weight":0.423767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555514,"sim:weight":0.384208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.377385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.374565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.365995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23165,"sim:weight":0.365488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14072,"sim:weight":0.361052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108827,"sim:weight":0.320552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555317,"sim:weight":0.319404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98468,"sim:weight":0.24859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58828,"sim:weight":0.232562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.230061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159504,"sim:weight":0.212922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As a result, much entrepreneurship research is fragmentary and focuses narrowly on aspects of entrepreneurship. Nonetheless, there are very rich descriptive data on what people mean when they talk about ‘enterprise’. The argument is developed that interpretative methodologies – new lenses for seeing entrepreneurship – such as social constructionism, are required to extend people’s understanding. If the fragmentary positivistic approaches are imagined as pieces of a jigsaw, it can be seen how a social constructivist approach can provide an overview of how the pieces match, fit and come together. Following this way of thinking, the authors propose Giddens ’s structuration as an orienting framework for these interpretative lenses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anderson, Alistair R.","Starnawska, Marzena"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.237397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.219239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.207966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351681,"sim:weight":0.192481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98658,"sim:weight":0.186788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53693,"sim:weight":0.167442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.166833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225643,"sim:weight":0.163433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Extant research in relation to the entrepreneurial process has tended to concentrate upon the entrepreneur as hero and other positive aspects of the process. Consequently, the darker sides of the entrepreneurial personality and enterprise culture such as the role of shame remain a relatively under researched facet of entrepreneurship theory. Despite this dearth of actual empirical studies, the negative aspects of entrepreneurial behaviour associated with the “flawed hero model of entrepreneurship” are implicitly understood. These negative aspects include hubris, tragedy, narcissism, over-stretching, hedonism, personality disorders, status anxiety, self-centeredness, destructive relationships, alcoholism, suicide and the most heinous of all, business failure. \n\nDesign/methodology/approach – The paper considers the deeply social phenomenon of shame on the entrepreneur and his or her world by developing a conceptual model of shame. The social script of shame is analysed as found in novels and as found in real life newspaper reports of such epic tragedies, using a chosen methodology of narrative analysis. \n\nFindings – The world portrayed in narrative is very much a “man\u0027s world” in which shame is a personal construct, a penance to be endured or ended and in the process a narrative script is developed. Shame is a deeply personal cognitive emotion easier to study in narrative than in person. From the stories of flawed heroes we construct a holistic model of possible entrepreneurial trajectories that take cognisance of wellbeing issues and cover the unspoken events that occur after a fall from grace. But why should we expect the story to end with the entrepreneur in crisis staring into the abyss? \n\nOriginality/value – Little previous work has been undertaken to explore entrepreneurial shame using both the entrepreneurship literature and narrative analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert","McElwee, Gerard"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1108/01443331111104823","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53917,"sim:weight":0.569061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.33865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14072,"sim:weight":0.316397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98993,"sim:weight":0.232066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.212848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.202591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.200733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78813,"sim:weight":0.19265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98899,"sim:weight":0.189784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.184143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98854,"sim:weight":0.183479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99288,"sim:weight":0.168559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.159954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186613,"sim:weight":0.147456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.141244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Indeed, the term is little more than a ’buzz word’ by those with only a fleeting understanding of entrepreneurship theory per se. Consequentially, the power of entrepreneurship to act as an organisational change agent remains untapped. Indeed, at present there is no policing – entrepreneurship nexus to speak of. This is surprising given the fluid nature of policing and the pragmatism of its multi-faceted work force. Although the mental maps of entrepreneurship and policing seldom converge criminologists such as Dick Hobbs (Hobbs 1988, 1991 and 1996) and Robin Fletcher (Fletcher, 2006) have begun to chart this neglected area of research. Hobbs appreciated the entrepreneurial role played by the ‘Detective’ whilst Fletcher that of the ‘Thief Taker’ and ‘Collator’. These three policing genres acted as entrepreneurs in a policing system where information was traded for results. This briefing paper explores the policing – entrepreneurship nexus, discussing how aspects of entrepreneurship theory such as intrapreneurship, corporate entrepreneurship, team entrepreneurship, social capital and networking can be applied in a practical context to transform Policing practices. Entrepreneurship theory properly applied to Policing problems has a role to play in combating crime for those prepared to take the risk!

As probationary constables and young officers, officers learn the job\nfrom listening to the stories of others, and for this reason part of being a successful police officer\nis learning to be a competent storyteller. Officers learn to gather intelligence by listening to the\nstories, or whispers, of criminals and members of the public with whom they come into contact.\nThey spend numerous hours on patrol swapping work stories with colleagues and learn to give\nnarrated evidence in court. Policing is therefore a narrative-bounded activity. Stories enable\npeople to share experiences and pass on what they know. Storytelling is therefore a useful way of\ncapturing and sharing knowledge. Stories are told daily throughout an organisation in the corridor,\nover coffee, by e-mail or through social media. Indeed Ward and Sbarcea (2001) suggest that\nrecently there has been an increase in stories as carriers of knowledge in organisations. Telling\nstories can also be a way of processing a particular experience, and can have therapeutic\nbenefits for the storyteller. In this briefing paper, we report on a research project into the use of\nonline blogging within a policing context that we are embarking on to investigate this exciting and\nunder-researched area of policing studies and knowledge management.\nThe aim of our project is to examine the current use of story-telling within the UK Police Service\nblogosphere. There are many blogs written by members of the emergency services. Such blogs\nappear to have three main functions: to educate the public (for example, on when to ring 999); to\nshare the blogger’s experience with other professionals, thus sharing and managing knowledge\nand learning from other professionals’ comments; and to use the therapeutic side of blogging to\nwork through difficult experiences encountered on the job.\nThis aim will be achieved through the following objectives:-\n• To determine whether stories in blogs are an effective way of sharing and transferring\nknowledge and learning from experience.\n• To determine whether stories in blogs are an effective way of educating the public.\n• To identify how such storytelling and blogging can be used as a form of therapy by the\nblogger.\n• To identify the benefits/barriers to storytelling in blogs within the Police Services\n• To identify any differences between the sexes within such storytelling and blogging.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burnett, Simon","Pedersen, Sarah","Smith, Robert"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222980,"sim:weight":0.339604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186612,"sim:weight":0.315318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185148,"sim:weight":0.294187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225646,"sim:weight":0.292907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269939,"sim:weight":0.274949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.274302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.272394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76136,"sim:weight":0.257762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930621,"sim:weight":0.257629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151061,"sim:weight":0.249001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2891,"sim:weight":0.247665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.244772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.235855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193190,"sim:weight":0.223121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77960,"sim:weight":0.21926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158609,"sim:weight":0.207873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56557,"sim:weight":0.205261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108022,"sim:weight":0.198523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162903,"sim:weight":0.198353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160541,"sim:weight":0.19833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, entrepreneurship as a social activity occurs in time and space and is seen as a natural, organic process. We assume this change will occur naturally, but this can be interrupted by planned change. This observational study examines the influence of socio-cultural factors on the evolution of community-based entrepreneurial activity in an urban village setting using the social metrics of home, habitus and habituation to examine how this activity develops within a planned monocultural middle class enclave. Studying social entrepreneurship in a fixed social setting permits us to investigate the embededdness of the entrepreneurial process in a naturally occurring environment. When the natural order is interrupted, entrepreneurial activity becomes disjointed and finds new avenues of emergence as community-based entrepreneurial activity in which business is facilitated by social networking and entrepreneurial identity is socially constructed through play.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert"],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1504/IJESB.2011.037340","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14072,"sim:weight":0.391715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.3719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555514,"sim:weight":0.347607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.286166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.283753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108827,"sim:weight":0.272716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227493,"sim:weight":0.244283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.19352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930888,"sim:weight":0.193116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109122,"sim:weight":0.193098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.169592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.168349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316083,"sim:weight":0.165429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.163585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98688,"sim:weight":0.136402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although this body of work has been quietly acknowledged, it has not invoked a reply, or refutation, from male entrepreneurship scholars. Nor has it led to an increase in studies about the influence of masculinity on entrepreneurial behaviour or identity. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to begin to address this by analysing an alternative social construction of entrepreneurship relating to how masculinity influences entrepreneurial identity in print. The data used are text from the thinly veiled biographical novel Cityboy written in an aggressive and unashamedly masculine style. Whilst the focus is not upon entrepreneurs per se, it is upon the male-oriented entrepreneurial institution that is the “city.” \n\nDesign/methodology/approach – The methodological approach used in this paper is that of biographical analysis; supported by a supplementary analysis of similar biographies of traders; this is triangulated by photographs downloaded from the internet. This approach allows rich data to be collected from practical sources permitting a comparative approach to be adopted. The approach has obvious limitations but is a practical method. \n\nFindings – The results from this empirical study are tentative but illustrate that the socially constructed nature of the “city trader” as an entrepreneurial identity is portrayed as being a manly pursuit; and how such discrimination is inherent within an institutionalised systemic behaviour in which men are encouraged to be risk-takers and players. This institutionalised “boyish” behaviour is used to build up a masculine identity rooted in Thatcherite enterprise culture. Although no clear conclusion can be articulated because of the subjective nature of the interpretation, links with accepted entrepreneurship theory are drawn. It is thus an exploratory study into the pervasiveness of masculine doxa in constructing entrepreneurial identity. The paper makes an incremental contribution by acknowledging the power of male dominance in shaping entrepreneurial realities albeit the conclusions are mainly drawn from one book. \n\nResearch limitations/implications – This paper opens up the field for further studies of skewed masculine entrepreneurial identities under the rubric of the “bad boy entrepreneur.” \n\nOriginality/value – In critically discussing and acknowledging the male genderedness of entrepreneurial identity in a particular system, this paper makes a contribution to the understanding of the socially constructed nature of how to tell, understand and appreciate stories which present an entrepreneurial identity. Granted the hero of the story is fictional but the overlaps with the accepted storylines of entrepreneur stories are illuminating. The paper provides another heuristic device for understanding the social construction of gendered entrepreneurial identities, making it of interest to feminist scholars of entrepreneurship and to social constructionists alike.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1108/17566261011026538","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.390278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.255086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.237106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.235981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.231057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.229301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.229131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.222123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.218662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53655,"sim:weight":0.209277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445178,"sim:weight":0.203822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.195435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Notwithstanding this, the literature seldom represents the underclass as an economically active grouping. This study counters this stance by considering street prostitutes and pimps as economically active members of an entrepreneurial underclass. Although previous studies have wrapped the prostitute (and particularly the Madame) in the mantle of entrepreneurship none have sought to do so in relation to the pimp who traditionally has been portrayed as a swaggering, flamboyant, violent, ruthless, calculating individual existing at the margins of society. In reality they remain an elusive and difficult to research genre. Few ever publicly accept the persona. Indeed, pimping runs contrary to accepted masculine doxa of what it means to be a man, making it deeply shameful to live off the immoral earnings of women. This paper, based upon the observations of the authors, adopts a semiotic perspective to re-focus these elusive characters in the entrepreneurial and criminological gaze. By concentrating upon prostitution and pimping as an entrepreneurial behaviour, and not on the prostitutes and pimps as entrepreneurial types, the paper contributes to extant knowledge by developing an appreciation of entrepreneurial strategies employed by them to create and extract value from their environment. The methodology circumvented the issues of access allowing a wider sociological discussion to develop, as well as highlighting other ethical issues of researching street level entrepreneurship.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert","Christou, Maria L."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84894,"sim:weight":0.257193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182178,"sim:weight":0.205746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108305,"sim:weight":0.20008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.169697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.166866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.162905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186613,"sim:weight":0.148304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99058,"sim:weight":0.146842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of them is emotion, operationalised as the mood people are in at the time of the evaluation and the way people feel with regards to the environment. A second variable considers the participants\u0027 attention and how they may be influenced by task instructions. The third variable, intrinsically related to the second one, is how environmental preference may be influenced depending on the perspective taken at the time of the evaluation.\nThe main research questions in this thesis are:\na) How does emotion influence environmental preference?\nb) What is the impact of perspective-taking on environmental preference?\nc) What are the benefits of using emotional reactions to the environment as predictors of preference?\nThese main research questions are addressed using both quantitative and qualitative methods, mainly quantitative, underpinned by a pragmatic approach. The unit of analysis in this thesis is the person who evaluates or judges an environment or a representation of it.\nFive studies are presented in this thesis. Study 1 (n\u003d10) reports the results from interviews with practising architects in the city of Aberdeen. These results show that when designing architects take two distinct perspectives: a prescriptive inferential perspective and a self, referential perspective. These interviews are used to set the context within which this thesis operates: the presentation of design to people with no expertise in architecture and built environment disciplines. The remaining four studies directly address this thesis\u0027 main research questions.\nIn Study 2 (n\u003d133), Study 3 (n\u003d146) and Study 5 (n\u003d64) the effects of perspective-taking on different dependent variables are experimentally tested. The dependent variables are: perceived restorativeness (Study 2), environmental preference as measured via informational variables (Study 3), and the emotional reactions people have to representations of the environment (Study 5). Results of these studies show that perspective-taking carries an interpersonal perception bias whereby taking a perspective other than the self results in different environmental evaluation outcomes, but that this process can also be affected by formal training.\nThe influences of emotion on environmental preference are directly explored in Studies 4 (n\u003d32) and 5 (n\u003d64). The results show that mood can have an influence on environmental preference by influencing the emotional reactions people have to the environment, but that these influences vary over time.\nOverall the thesis shows that perspective-taking and emotion have a range of influences on environmental preference in a built environment context, that these are important at the point at which architecture and built environment professionals design environments, and that timing of environmental evaluations in longitudinal assessments can make the difference between positive and less positive evaluations. This thesis\u0027 results are discussed in light of existing knowledge and some recommendations are made for future research and practitioners in architecture and built environment disciplines.","bibo:AuthorList":["Galan-Diaz, Carlos Roberto","Conniff, Anna","Craig, Tony","Pearson, David G."],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99136,"sim:weight":0.301201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.280371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.269859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.267807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56680,"sim:weight":0.267693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388776,"sim:weight":0.267383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.2591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.258236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.254943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99250,"sim:weight":0.244788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23711,"sim:weight":0.240995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.236832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22782,"sim:weight":0.232979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108547,"sim:weight":0.226177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.222592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85837,"sim:weight":0.211835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632042,"sim:weight":0.209623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50121,"sim:weight":0.203354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.183682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Generally, non-healing wounds display similar physiological features with regards to mixed bacterial flora, ischemia and production of exudate. The application of topical, broad spectrum antimicrobial compounds embedded in absorbent dressings has been shown to control bioburden and improve healing. Lyophilised, biopolymeric antimicrobial wafers can offer a contemporary, user-friendly, self-adhesive and effective approach for the management of suppuration and polybacterial contamination in a wide range of non-healing wounds.\nCohesive, non-friable, porous, disc shape wafers were successfully produced with sodium alginate (SA) (18.17 ± 0.70 Pa.s), guar gum (GG) (82.21 ± 5.41 Pa.s; 95.87 ± 2.31 Pa), xanthan gum (XG) (2.86 ± 0.12 Pa.s; 23.61 ± 0.68 Pa), karaya gum (KAG) (12.89 ± 0.93 Pa.s) and an original gel consisting of a blend of a synergistic SA-KAG (7.75 ± 0.64 Pa.s; 86.34 ± 5.19 Pa) (1:1 ratio). Clinical concentrations of the broad spectrum, topical, antimicrobial compounds, neomycin sulphate (0.5 % w/v NS), chlorhexidine digluconate (0.5 % v/v CHD), povidone iodine (1.0 % v/v PVP-I) and silver sulfadiazine (1.0 % w/v SS) were mixed with compatible biopolymers and appeared to alter the rheological properties of the biopolymers. Rheological analysis of pre-lyophilised gels was undertaken to quantify the flow properties of the gels. The necessity of producing sterile wafers was investigated by exposing all biopolymer-antimicrobial combinations to 25 and 40 kGy of gamma irradiation. Gamma-rays caused total degradation of GG, KAG, SA and SA-KAG, while XG appeared to withstand irradiation.\nA novel free standing dissolution raft (FSDR) was designed and used to quantify the CHD released from both gels and wafers. CHD released from wafers ranged from 3.5 ± 0.01 to 17.4 ± 0.39 %. Gels and wafers released CHD in a sustained manner and the release profile of wafers was similar to the respective gels, with the exception of GG. Neither gels nor wafers released 100 % of the incorporated antimicrobial indicating that drug-polymer interactions governed the general performance of antimicrobial wafers, in terms of adhesion, expansion ratio (ER), inhibition ratio (IR), water uptake capacity (WUC) and antimicrobial delivery. Molecular modelling studies undertaken for KAG-antimicrobial complexes demonstrated an unusual ‘Z-shape’ geometry for cationic CHD. The charge and geometry of CHD was plausibly responsible for the antimicrobial’s entrapment within biopolymeric networks.\nThe efficacy of antimicrobial wafers was demonstrated in vitro under simulated conditions of an exuding wound using modified disc diffusion and an original antimicrobial diffusion cell (ADC). All wafers were effective in vitro against common chronic wound pathogens of such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Antimicrobial activity depended on the sensitivity of the microorganisms to a specific antimicrobial compound and the presence of organic material. Data obtained demonstrated that the presence of protein (BSA) in the pseudo-exudate inhibited the antimicrobial activity of CHD and PVP-I, while enhancing the antimicrobial activity of SS and NS against MRSA.\nThe general findings summarised in this thesis conclude that factors such as protein content, electrolyte content and pH of exudate play a key role in the efficacy of self-adhesive, absorbent formulations intended for the topical delivery of antimicrobial compounds to non-healing, infected wounds. Drug-polymer interactions developed between biopolymers and incorporated antimicrobial compounds have a profound effect on the general performance of lyophilised antimicrobial wafers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Labovitiadi, Olga","Matthews, Kerr H.","Lamb, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":51739,"sim:weight":0.205838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.132239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929817,"sim:weight":0.130421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.125697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930803,"sim:weight":0.122637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99440,"sim:weight":0.122308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.116041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99455,"sim:weight":0.110713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388451,"sim:weight":0.109037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.1051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18064,"sim:weight":0.10424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269990,"sim:weight":0.103147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98796,"sim:weight":0.0999205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98988,"sim:weight":0.0939728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930758,"sim:weight":0.0908284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98984,"sim:weight":0.0855985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98848,"sim:weight":0.0767207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, unlike the audiences in more meticulously choreographed exhibition contexts, those in stations are usually involuntary. New criteria for the creation and evaluation of artworks in these context are necessary to enhance the connection between the audience and the artwork, and to elicit meaningful experience via interactivity.\nThis research aims to uncover the critical factors that can turn an indifferent passenger into an explorative participant, subsequently leading them to obtain meaningful experiences through interaction with computer-based interactive artwork. This research focuses on artworks that are permanently installed in the stations, with three case studies conducted in MRT stations forming the backbone of the research. Field observation was the first step in each case study, conducted in order to understand the fundamentals of the interactivity between the passengers and the artworks. This was followed by in-depth interviews with the passengers and three professional interview groups.\nA critical Analytical Framework was formed throughout the course of the research, identifying five engaging characteristics: Incentive, Transfer, Accessibility, Play, and Challenge. These five characteristics were eventually reapplied to re-examine the case studies and the content of the interviews with the professionals. The findings of this research articulate how the Analytical Framework can be adopted in future research intended to create the conditions for more meaningful art-interactions.\nThis Analytical Framework will assist artists, designers and researchers in their pre-planning and follow up evaluations of the degree of engagement generated by computer-based interactive artworks displayed in transport hubs. The interest that the outcomes of this research has attracted in the field suggests that the framework could be extended to the examination of various computer-based interactive artworks in similar public contexts. In this context, the framework would play a valuable role in uncovering a more dynamic paradigm used to illustrate how meaningful experiences can evolve in similar public spaces.","bibo:AuthorList":["Her, Jiun-Jhy","Buckley, Jim","Hamlyn, Jim","Douglas, Anne","Gray, Carole"],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.314351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.250229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.246456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.242694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.241003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.187213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.145274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study extends the analysis of entrepreneurial narrative by considering a different narrative dimension, namely that of scrapbooks and storyboards and makes a contribution to the extant literature of entrepreneurship and small business by highlighting the necessity of conducting empirical research into narrative forms such as storyboards and scrapbooks and their impact upon the biographical process in business.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert"],"dc:date":"2011-06","doi":"10.1504/WREMSD.2011.040808","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.238434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14072,"sim:weight":0.232983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999798,"sim:weight":0.201031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78813,"sim:weight":0.198588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.142827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22542,"sim:weight":0.125249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.114315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269897,"sim:weight":0.113502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.111658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.107998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.107164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108887,"sim:weight":0.0925474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The main motivation is to observe\nif researchers, in the context of knowledge discovery, use different criteria to judge the relevance\nof the information presented. Additionally, the effects that discipline and research\nexperience background may have on these manifestations are investigated.\nThe scenario selected to carry out the observation is that of Literature Based Discovery\n(LBD). LBD is a trial-error interactive search strategy, developed by Swanson (1986a),\nwhich supports the finding and retrieving of complementary bodies of literature – sets\nof articles that are bibliographically non-interactive yet logically connected. Research\nscientists from three different disciplines and research experience backgrounds are observed\nwhile they interact with an LBD system built for the purposes of this study. Their cognitive\nprocesses and interactions are recorded and analysed. To aid in the analysis of the data,\nthe concept of relevance criteria profiles is developed. Relevance criteria profiles are a\ntechnique to count and group the expressions of relevance criteria as observed during the\nsearch sessions. These offer the possibility of aggregating the observations into group\nprofiles as well as the ability to measure the (dis)similarities that may arise in between\nprofiles. As relevance criteria profiles provide a global view of the criteria used to judge\nrelevance, a complementary visualisation technique is also developed. This technique\ndisplays the relevance judgement processes, as well as the interactions, in a sequential\nfashion allowing the researcher to perform temporal analyses on the session data.\nThe results show that researchers do use a variety of criteria when judging the relevance\nof information in the context of LBD. Moreover, individuals use these criteria in different\nfrequencies; both discipline and research experience background seem to influence these\nfrequencies however they may not be the only intervening factors. The observed interaction\npatterns suggest that researchers approach the problem in two stages: i) an initial more\nexploratory stage followed by ii) a more focused and engaged stage. The main contribution\nof this thesis is the observation of these manifestations of relevance together with the\ninteraction patterns. The final recommendation offered is that the multi-dimensional\nnature of relevance in this context should be addressed when evaluating LBD systems.\nAdditionally, it is acknowledged that certain interaction behaviours may also be used\nduring the design and testing of such systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Beresi, Ulises Cervino","Holt, Patrik","Lothian, Robert","Hui, Kit-Ying"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9548426,"sim:weight":0.494195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.27524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108269,"sim:weight":0.253431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.231284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108074,"sim:weight":0.231078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.227697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98493,"sim:weight":0.218913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.217336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99250,"sim:weight":0.21422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108579,"sim:weight":0.21405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.18323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1507968,"sim:weight":0.178186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This action served to highlight the serious problem bacterial resistance now presents to healthcare professionals globally. This investigation focussed on the action of four cationic antimicrobial agents against E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Triclosan is widely used clinically and as an ingredient of personal care products that has come under renewed scrutiny by the FDA last year. Colistin is used clinically as salvage therapy against multi-drug resistant bacteria, particularly P. aeruginosa and A. baumanii. NP101 and NP108 are novel antimicrobial peptides, considered as a class with huge future potential in the treatment of not only bacterial but also viral and fungal infections in humans. The action of triclosan on all three test bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, historically considered resistant to triclosan, revealed concentration dependent bacteriostatic/bactericidal effects; reduction in bacterial growth; inhibition of second-phase logarithmic growth in S. aureus; induction of minimal K+ loss in all bacterial species; non-septation and aggregation in all test species. Colistin use was abandoned clinically between 1970-2000 and is not used clinically against Gram-positive species. Colistin exposure induced a common response from test bacteria including the Gram-positive S. aureus; concentration dependent retardation in onset of bacterial growth, without reduction in final bacterial density; significant K+ loss from S. aureus and E. coli but not P. aeruginosa; the development of resistance to the inhibitory colistin concentration by P. aeruginosa and S. aureus but not E. coli; production of small colony variants by P. aeruginosa; formation of spherical aggregates; membrane blebbing and inhibition of normal bacterial septation. Similar responses to NP101 and NP108 were observed to the test bacteria; an all or nothing effect on bacterial growth; prevention of second phase logarithmic growth in S. aureus; induction of significant K+ loss in all bacteria; size and shape alterations; extrusion of intracellular material, membrane blebbing; inhibition of bacterial septation and interruption of binary fission. Each of these peptides was incorporated into lyophilised wafers and tested for in vitro topical antibacterial efficacy and shown to have antibacterial activity against all test species.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Driscoll, Noelle H.","Lamb, Andrew","Matthews, Kerr H.","Mercer, Derry"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These\nissues were discussed in relation to PP in general and not only for\nantimicrobials. Participants perceived successful implementation of PP to be\nassociated with factors including ward type and patient’s clinical condition.\nNone of the pharmacists were prescribing antimicrobials and consequently\nfurther studies focused on PP in general.\nA scoping exercise, utilising various sources of information, reinforced\nfindings from Phase 1; it highlighted the absence of any national or Health\nBoard frameworks to support implementation of PP in secondary care in\nScotland.\nConsensus-based research was undertaken, therefore, to provide guidance\nto facilitate service redesign involving PP in secondary care in Scotland.

Inspiration was drawn both from Biological Visual Systems and Artificial Image Recognition Systems. Several Biological Systems including the Insect, Toad and Human Visual Systems were studied alongside popular Pattern Recognition Systems such as fully connected Feedforward Networks, Modular Neural Networks and the Neocognitron.\nThe developed system, called the Distributed Neural Network (DNN) was based on the sensory-motor connections in the common toad, Bufo Bufo. The sparsely connected network architecture has features of modularity enhanced by the presence of lateral inhibitory connections. It was implemented using Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANN).\nA novel method called ‘FUSION’ was used to train the DNN, which is an amalgamation of several concepts of learning in Artificial Neural Networks such as Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Competitive Learning, Self-organisation and Fuzzy Logic.\nThe DNN has unique feature detecting capabilities. When the DNN was tested using images that comprised of combination of features used in the training set, the DNN was successful in recognising individual features. The combinations of features were never used in the training set. This is a unique feature of the DNN trained using Fusion that cannot be matched by any other popular ANN architecture or training method. The system proved to be robust in dealing with New and Noisy Images.\nThe unique features of the DNN make the network suitable for applications in robotics such as obstacle avoidance and terrain recognition, where the environment is unpredictable. The network can also be used in the field of Medical Imaging, Biometrics (Face and Finger Print Recognition) and Quality Inspection in the Food Processing Industry and applications in other uncontrolled environments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reddipogu, Ann","Maxwell, Grant M.","MacLeod, Christopher","Elder, Stewart"],"dc:date":"2006-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86966,"sim:weight":0.305029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2675553,"sim:weight":0.301602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20346,"sim:weight":0.276577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998446,"sim:weight":0.248344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271201,"sim:weight":0.227301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2680712,"sim:weight":0.218423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98644,"sim:weight":0.205675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.204828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5589399,"sim:weight":0.204292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87106,"sim:weight":0.197698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.194771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182552,"sim:weight":0.190631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934910,"sim:weight":0.182649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60726,"sim:weight":0.132781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A\n‘sequential-mixed methods’ was employed in the conduct of the research.\nThe first phase was a cross-sectional postal questionnaire of all pharmacist\nprescribers (n\u003d 1654 in January 2009), to quantify the extent and nature of\nprescribing and key factors associated with prescribing practice.\nResponse rate was 42.3% (n\u003d695). The pharmacy practice setting was\nsignificantly associated with prescribing (those in hospital or general medical\npractice were more likely to have prescribed (p\u003c 0.05), than respondents in\ncommunity practice). Factor analysis of attitudinal statements on prescribing\nimplementation revealed factors, grouped as: ‘administrative structures and\nprocesses’, ‘perceptions of pharmacists’ prescribing role’ and ‘facilities for\nprescribing’. Scores for ‘facilities for prescribing’ varied depending on practice\nsetting. Respondents in community practice recorded lower median scores\ncompared with those in general medical practices. However, there were no\nstatistically significant differences in median scores between respondents based\nin GP and hospital settings.\nIn-depth qualitative work undertaken in the second phase further explored\nfacilitators of, and challenges to prescribing practice (e.g. the lack of defined\nprescribing roles) identified in phase one. Semi-structured interviews were\nconducted with a purposive sample of 34 prescribers. Prescribers were selected\nfrom diverse settings, including secondary care from England and Scotland, to\nhighlight key factors contributing to prescribing success which could potentially\ninform extrapolations of successful practice from one setting to the other.\nThe ‘framework’ approach to qualitative data analysis was rigorously applied,\nrevealing that the professional isolation and issues around access to clinical\ndata and administrative support in the community setting may have negatively\nimpacted on prescribing implementation. Notably, a perceived lack of clarity and\ndefinition of the pharmacist prescribing role was a key theme in hindering\nprescribing practice of pharmacists irrespective of setting. Participants described ‘ideal’ roles which they perceived as potentially providing clarity,\ndefinition and direction to facilitate implementation.\nThe original data generated through this research highlights that prescribing\nimplementation is less than desired, especially in community pharmacies.\nPharmacist prescribing appears to have progressed little since supplementary\nprescribing developments in 2004, even with the much heralded arrival of\nindependent prescribing in 2006. Interestingly, phase 2 participants suggested a\n‘hybrid supplementary/independent’ prescribing model, as more likely to\nsucceed. In this model, pharmacist prescribers favour a cooperative practice\narrangement in which doctors diagnose and pharmacists prescribe.

The categorisation and analysis of the components of an entrepreneurial identity widens our knowledge about entrepreneurship as a socio-economic phenomenon. These images form part of the identity of enterprise, a physical manifestation of a nebulas phenomenon and act as ‘visual metaphors’. This study extends research into the entrepreneurial narrative by the semiotic analysis of entrepreneurial imagery, examining how these entrepreneurial identities and images are constructed in narrative and in the media as a semiotic formula, which surprisingly has much in common with class based, criminal iconology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Robert","Anderson, Alistair R."],"dc:date":"2003-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98865,"sim:weight":0.227612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":704032,"sim:weight":0.209232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.189031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182178,"sim:weight":0.161615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108223,"sim:weight":0.158733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.150887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.144341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108303,"sim:weight":0.143584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98854,"sim:weight":0.142067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.133695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108748,"sim:weight":0.129168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.12118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Otherwise, as the title of this article suggests there might be serious legal implications for an employer. \nThe clause (usually a substitution clause) or the type of contract entered into must not simply be a device to circumvent the correct application of the law in other words perpetrate a sham.  The recent development of legal rules that can invalidate sham clauses or bogus contracts in employment have proven beneficial to workers. In particular those workers that want to be treated as employees. As will be seen when a court or tribunal has a reasonable suspicion that the clause (or the contract itself) is a sham that is designed, for example, to exclude employee status (to those persons working under a contract with an employer) they may decide to ignore it and treat the contract as a contract of service. The affected worker will then have entitlement to the full range of employment rights available to an employee.

The purpose of this paper is to try to establish the obstacles and the perceived barriers to the continuing use of e-trade technologies by small Korean firms. \n\nDesign/methodology/approach – The literature was employed to develop a theoretical model that includes perceived risk and the environment. The model was operationalised in a questionnaire completed by 164 respondents. LISREL validated the instrument and the model. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling. \n\nFindings – The authors found that information risk and business risk negatively affect adoption and use. The authors also tested the relationship between the environment of the organisation and adoption of e-trade. The results show that the maturity of information technology and the innovation characteristics of the firm have positive influences on the adoption of e-trade. \n\nResearch limitations/implications – This study uses data from existing users, so the findings extend the existing literature about decisions to adopt and use new processes. The data are, however, limited to the Korean context. \n\nPractical implications – The study demonstrates the negative influence of perceptions about risk associated with innovative processes. Thus, this awareness and understanding of how barriers are perceived should help to increase the diffusion of e-trade systems.

In these austere times, models of social and community enterprise are becoming more important. This corresponds to the emergence of theories of community-based entrepreneurship and social enterprise as explanatory variables. Such theories are used to label enterprising behaviour enacted within our communities, even when the theoretical arguments underpinning these re-conceptualisations require to be stretched to permit this. Often the resultant explanations are not entirely convincing.

Some regional tourism stakeholders have created DMOs to manage their respective regional attractions, but until now, this has not been the case with north-east Scotland. As a prelude to the potential creation of a regional DMO, the purpose of this paper is to empirically evaluate tourism business leaders\u0027 attitudes and likely acceptance of the DMO\u0027s structure and functions. \n\nDesign/methodology/approach – The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode (TKCM) was utilised to provide an evaluative framework, with discussion of the assertiveness versus cooperativeness needs of tourism business stakeholders in the region. The TKCM\u0027s measurement instrument was utilised along with a purpose-built questionnaire to gather information about tourism leaders\u0027 interaction orientations and their level of support for the formation of a DMO, its structure and functions. \n\nFindings – Tourism leaders in north-east Scotland are collaboration-oriented. Initial findings indicate that on balance, tourism businesses (as expressed by their managers/owners) are persuaded by the attractiveness of collaboration at an integrated regional level, but would nevertheless prefer a certain degree of competition. In addition, organisational size and membership of existing destination management networks appear to moderate the interaction choice preference. \n\nResearch limitations/implications – First, the scale and questionnaire instrument developed to test attitudes toward a DMO formation have not been exhaustively evaluated, nor have the potential moderating factors been comprehensively assessed. A more robust and validated scale should be developed and moderators clearly modelled. Second, current sample size is limited and may not provide an adequate basis for generalisation. In future, a larger sample should be employed. Finally, this research is exploratory in scope, and future research, designed along an evaluative and analytical basis, is encouraged. \n\nPractical implications – Collaboration within a new DMO in marketing to new markets and the support for this is not challenged, but some competition among tourism providers will continue. It is likely that the disparity between tourism performance in the city and rural areas will continue in the near future. The role of the DMO will therefore involve enlarging the customer base and raising the tourism profiles of both city and rural locations, in order to create a level playing field. \n\nOriginality/value – This research is the first to utilise the TKCM and Instrument to assess tourism business leaders\u0027 assertiveness versus cooperativeness orientations, prior to the initiation of an alliance in a region. The paper shows that this approach holds viability for future research in this direction, especially the potential of TKCM as a predictive framework for interorganisational interaction and collaboration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Atorough, Peter","Martin, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2012","doi":"10.1108/17538331211209031","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":61142,"sim:weight":0.482262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.267908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183850,"sim:weight":0.1792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.112533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

By developing an RF model of online consumer shopping behavior (REFCOS) covering motives, behaviors, and continuance-evaluation and empirically testing a number of hypotheses, we find how consumers with different foci use the Internet.

Recognition of information\nfor specific situations identified with users’ context and\nthe state of the world is helpful to operators in performing tasks\nin complex environments. The emergence of ubiquitous, ambient,\nand pervasive technologies is increasingly providing methods to\nhelp operators to perform their tasks in smart and intelligent\nways. Existing user interface design does not solve the problem\nof drawing together the information required for situation-aware\ndecision support systems in a way that minimises cognitive load.\nThis paper discusses a framework for user interface design\nof situation-aware systems that exploit inputs from users and\nthe environment to provide information tailored to the user’s\ntasks in specific situations. The user interface can reconfigure\nautomatically in order to adapt to the current situation. The\nadaptation of the user interface to the current situation and\nthe presentation of a reusable sequence of tasks in the situation\nreduces memory loads on operators.

The effects on body composition, measured by direct techniques, of a controlled 25% body-surfacearea thermal injury have been studied in two groups of forty male Wistar rats.\n2.

Employee interpretations\nand reactions after each communication from the management team were analysed as\nthe ‘organisational story’ ‘unfolds’ from the ‘other side’ (i.e. employee perspective) instead\nof the rather usual/dominant one (i.e. managerial perspective). Behaviour was observed\nfrom an interactionist, interpretive and critical perspective and analysed in the light of\nseveral managerial and communication theories with the aim of critically examining the\nclaims of the post-modern organisation theory (i.e. humanisation of work) and certain\ncommunication theories. An ethnographic approach, which enabled the\nresearcher/participant to conduct participant observation in a real setting, ensured deep\nunderstanding of social situations and human actions. The results of this study suggest\nthat upward communication is problematic due to the power settings that exist in\norganisations. Based on Goffman’s theory, it is suggested that employee ‘performance’ is\naffected by certain rules and conventions which shape organisational psychology and\ninterpersonal relations. Therefore, the utopian claims of the post-modern organisation\ntheory along with the rather simplistic assumptions of some of the literature on\ncommunication need to be re-evaluated and re-defined in the search for a more critical\nunderstanding of communication. This thesis concludes that contrary to the utopia of the\npost-modern organisation, the reality of organisational life and communication reflects the\npersistence of the modern organisation and the power structures which dominate it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tsiontsi, Nikoletta","Halsall, Robert","Brown, Mary"],"dc:date":"2012-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.293651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.274322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58839,"sim:weight":0.268613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53666,"sim:weight":0.264243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181798,"sim:weight":0.254941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108027,"sim:weight":0.239351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340561,"sim:weight":0.230574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.209066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
