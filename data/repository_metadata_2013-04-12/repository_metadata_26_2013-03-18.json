(2) To allow developers to build and share tools that operate on such a provenance model. (3) To define provenance in a precise, technology-agnostic manner. (4) To support a digital representation of provenance for any \u0027thing\u0027, whether produced by computer systems or not. (5) To allow multiple levels of description to coexist. (6) To define a core set of rules that identify the valid inferences that can be made on provenance representation.

From the complexity of formation of a set of traces via a specified route a measure of the probability of that route can be determined. By determining the complexities of alternative routes leading to the formation of the same set of traces, the odds ratio indicating the relative plausibility of the alternative routes can be found. An illustrative application to a BitTorrent piracy case is presented, and the results obtained suggest that the OCM is capable of providing a realistic estimate of the odds ratio for two competing hypotheses. It is also demonstrated that the OCM can be straightforwardly refined to encompass a variety of circumstances.","bibo:AuthorList":["Overill, Richard E","Silomon, Jantje A M","Chow, Kam-Pui"],"dc:date":"2010-02-15","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R E Overill and J A M Silomon.

Agents make substantial decisions for themselves, so thorough testing is an important consideration. However, autonomy also makes testing harder; by their nature, autonomous agents may react in different ways to the same inputs over time, because, for instance they have changeable goals and knowledge. For this reason, we argue that testing of autonomous agents requires a procedure that caters for a wide range of test case contexts, and that can search for the most demanding of these test cases, even when they are not apparent to the agents’ developers. In this paper, we address this problem, introducing and evaluating an approach to testing autonomous agents that uses evolutionary optimization to generate demanding test cases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nguyen, Cu D.","Perini, Anna","Tonella, Paolo","Miles, Simon","Harman, Mark","Luck, Michael"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J A Bot´ıa, A Lo´pez-Acosta and A F Go´mez-Skarmeta.

The problem is that traditional agent architectures and their associated languages provide no mechanism to adapt an agent at runtime to norms constraining their behaviour. This is important because if BDI-type agents are to operate in open environments, they need to adapt to changes in the norms that regulate such environments. In response, in this paper we provide a technique to extend BDI agent languages, by enabling them to enact behaviour modification at runtime in response to newly accepted norms. Our solution consists of creating new plans to comply with obligations and suppressing the execution of existing plans that violate prohibitions. We demonstrate the viability of our approach through an implementation of our solution in the AgentSpeak(L) language.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meneguzzi, Felipe","Luck, Michael"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H Aldewereld, F Dignum, A García-Camino, P Noriega, J A Rodríguez-Aguilar and C Sierra.

Where there are many contracts within a particular application, it can be difficult to determine whether the system can reliably fulfil them all, yet computer-parsable electronic contracts may allow such verification to be automated. In this chapter, we describe a conceptual framework and architecture specification in which normative business contracts can be electronically represented, verified, established, renewed, and so on. In particular, we aim to allow systems containing multiple contracts to be checked for conflicts and violations of business objectives. We illustrate the framework and architecture with an aerospace aftermarket example.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Simon","Oren, Nir","Luck, Michael","Modgil, Sanjay","Meneguzzi, Felipe","Faci, Nora","Holt, Camden","Vickers, Gary"],"bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Andrieux, K Czajkowski, A Dan, K Keahey, H Ludwig, J Pruyne, J Rofrano, S Tuecke and M Xu.

While there has been much research on simulating trust between agents, there are areas where such trust is harder to establish. In particular, contract proposals may come from parties that an agent has had no prior interaction with and, in competitive business-to-business environments, little reputation information may be available. In human practice, trust in a proposed contract is determined in part from the content of the proposal itself, and the similarity of the content to that of prior contracts, executed to varying degrees of success. In this paper, we argue that such analysis is also appropriate in automated systems, and to provide it we need systems to record salient details of prior contract use and algorithms for assessing proposals on their content. We use provenance technology to provide the former and detail algorithms for measuring contract success and similarity for the latter, applying them to an aerospace case study.","bibo:AuthorList":["Groth, Paul","Miles, Simon","Modgil, Sanjay","Oren, Nir","Luck, Michael","Gil, Yolanda"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Miles, P Groth, S Munroe and L Moreau.

However, violations at the bottom of the supply chain (part suppliers) can easily cascade to the top (aircraft  operators), making it difficult to determine the source of the violation, and seek to address it. In this context, we have developed a global monitoring architecture that ensures the detection of norm violations and generates explanations for the origin of violations. In this paper, we describe the implementation and deployment of a global monitor in the aerospace domain of [8] and show how it generates explanations for violations within the  maintenance supply chain. We show how these explanations can be used not only to detect violations at runtime, but also to uncover potential problems in contracts before their deployment, thus improving them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meneguzzi, Felipe","Modgil, Sanjay","Oren, Nir","Miles, Simon","Luck, Michael","Faci, Nora","Holt, Camden","Smith, Malcolm","Decker, Keith","Simao Sichman, Jaime","Sierra, Carles","Castelfranchi, Cristiano"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Lopez Y Lopez, M Luck and M d’Inverno.

Norms have therefore been proposed as a means to regulate agent behaviours in open and dynamic systems, where these norms specify the obliged, permitted and prohibited behaviours of agents. Regulation can effectively be achieved through use of enforcement mechanisms that result in a net loss of utility for an agent in cases where the agent’s behaviour fails to comply with the norms. Recognition of compliance is thus crucial for achieving regulation. In this paper we propose a generic architecture for observation of agent behaviours, and recognition of these behaviours as constituting, or counting as, compliance or violation. The architecture deploys monitors that receive inputs from observers, and processes these inputs together with transition network representations of individual norms. In this way, monitors determine the fulfillment or violation status of norms. The paper also describes a proof of concept implementation and deployment of monitors in electronic contracting environments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Modgil, Sanjay","Faci, Nora","Meneguzzi, Felipe","Oren, Nir","Miles, Simon","Luck, Michael","Decker, Keith","Simao Sichman, Jaime","Sierra, Carles","Castelfranchi, Cristiano"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9593,"sim:weight":0.729517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9605,"sim:weight":0.576457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9595,"sim:weight":0.526159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98829,"sim:weight":0.367218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573418,"sim:weight":0.365598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.330484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.326528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.309568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145822,"sim:weight":0.300344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.287216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.286014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.286014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.286014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.286014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.286014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.286014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.286014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.286014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.286014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.286014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Regulation can effectively be achieved through use\r\n of enforcement mechanisms that result in a net loss of utility for an agent in \r\ncases where the agent\u0027s behaviour fails to comply with the norms. Recognition of\r\n compliance is thus crucial for achieving regulation. In this paper we propose a\r\n generic architecture for observation of agent behaviours, and recognition of these behaviours as constituting, or counting as, compliance or violation. \r\nThe architecture deploys monitors that receive inputs from observers, and processes these inputs together with transition network representations of individual \r\nnorms. In this way, monitors determine the fulfillment or violation status of norms. The paper also describes a proof of concept implementation and deployment of monitors in electronic contracting environments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Modgil, Sanjay","Faci, Nora","Meneguzzi, Felipe","Oren, Nir","Miles, Simon","Luck, Michael"],"dc:date":"2009-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Keller and H Ludwig.

Norms have therefore been proposed as a means to regulate agent behaviours in open and dynamic systems, and may be encoded in electronic contracts in order to specify the obliged, permitted and prohibited behaviours of agents that are signatories to such contracts. Enactment and management of electronic contracts thus enables the use of regulatory mechanisms to ensure that agent behaviours comply with the encoded norms. To facilitate such mechanisms requires monitoring in order to detect and explain violation of norms. In this paper we propose a framework for monitoring that is to be implemented and integrated into a suite of contract enactment and management tools. The framework adopts a non-intrusive approach to monitoring, whereby the states of a contract with respect to its contained norms can be inferred on the basis of messages exchanged. Specifically, the framework deploys agents that observe messages sent between contract signatories, where these messages correspond to agent behaviours and therefore indicate whether norms are, or are in danger of, being violated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Faci, Noura","Modgil, Sanjay","Oren, Nir","Meneguzzi, Felipe","Miles, Simon","Luck, Michael"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Miles, N Oren, M Luck, S Modgil, N Faci, C Holt and G Vickers.

However, where there are many contracts within a particular application, it can be difficult to determine whether the system can reliably fulfil them all; computer-parsable electronic contracts may\r\nallow such verification to be automated. In this paper, we describe a conceptual framework and architecture  specification in which normative business contracts can be electronically represented, verified, established, renewed, etc. In particular, we aim to allow systems containing\r\nmultiple contracts to be checked for conflicts and violations of business objectives. We illustrate the framework and architecture with an aerospace example.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Simon","Oren, Nir","Luck, Michael","Modgil, Sanjay","Faci, Nora","Holt, Camden","Vickers, Gary"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Miles, N Oren, M Luck, S Modgil, N Faci, C Holt and G Vickers.

They can be used to regulate behaviour by providing negative consequences, penalties, where the responsibilities and expectations are not met, i.e. the contract is violated. However, long-term business relationships require some flexibility in the face of circumstances that do not conform to the assumptions of the contract, that is, mitigating circumstances. In this paper, we describe how contract parties can represent and enact policies on mitigating circumstances. As part of this, we require records of what has occurred within the system leading up to a violation: the provenance of the violation. We therefore bring together contract-based and provenance systems to solve the issue of mitigating circumstances.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Simon","Groth, Paul","Luck, Michael"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Chrysanthos Dellarocas.

These languages provide a theoretically sound basis for agent design but are very limited in providing direct support for autonomy and societal cooperation needed for large scale systems. Some techniques for autonomy and cooperation have been explored in the past in ad hoc implementations, but not incorporated in any agent language. In order to address these shortcomings we extend the well known AgentSpeak(L) BDI agent language to include behaviour generation through planning, declarative goals and motivated goal adoption. We also develop a language-specific multiagent cooperation scheme and, to address potential problems arising from autonomy in a multiagent system, we extend our agents with a mechanism for norm processing leveraging existing theoretical work. These extensions allow for greater autonomy in the resulting systems, enabling them to synthesise new behaviours at runtime and to cooperate in non-scripted patterns.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meneguzzi, Felipe Rech"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N Howden, R Ro¨nnquist, A Hodgson and A Lucas.

For example, while the popular AgentSpeak(L) has had various extensions and improvements proposed, it still essentially a single-agent language. In response, in this paper, we describe a simple, yet effective, technique for multiagent planning that enables an agent to take advantage of cooperating agents in a society. In particular, we build on a technique that enables new plans to be added to a plan library through the invocation of an external planning component, and extend it to include the construction of plans involving the chaining of subplans of others. Our mechanism makes use of plan patterns that insulate the planning process from the resulting distributed aspects of plan execution through local proxy plans that encode information about the preconditions and effects of the external plans provided by agents willing to cooperate. In this way, we allow an agent to discover new ways of achieving its goals through local planning and the delegation of tasks for execution by others, allowing it to overcome individual limitations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meneguzzi, Felipe","Luck, Michael","Jung, Bernhard","Michel, Fabien","Ricci, Alessandro","Petta, Paolo"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2004).

Plans in these architectures are often self-contained procedures with an associated triggering event and a context condition, while any further information about the consequences of executing a plan is absent. However, agents designed using such an approach have limited flexibility at runtime, and rely on the designer’s ability to foresee all relevant situations an agent might have to handle. In order to overcome this limitation, we have created AgentSpeak(PL), an interpreter capable of performing state-space planning to generate new high-level plans. As the planning module creates new plans, the plan library is expanded, improving performance over time. However, for new plans to be useful in the long run, it is critical that the context condition associated with new plans is carefully generated. In this paper we describe a plan reuse technique aimed at improving an agent’s runtime performance by deriving optimal context conditions for new plans, allowing an agent to reuse generated plans as much as possible.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meneguzzi, Felipe","Luck, Michael","Baldoni, Matteo","Son, Tran Cao","vanRiemsdijk, M.

This is certainly true in the aerospace domain, where manufacturers, suppliers and operators must coordinate their activities to maximise safety and profit, for example. To address this need, the notion of norms has been proposed which, when incorporated into formal electronic documents, allow for the specification and deployment of contract-driven systems. In this context, we describe the CONTRACT framework and architecture for exactly this purpose, and describe a concrete instantiation of this architecture as a prototype system applied to an aerospace aftercare scenario.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meneguzzi, Felipe","Miles, Simon","Luck, Michael","Holt, Camden","Smith, Malcolm","Oren, Nir","Faci, Nora","Modgil, Sanjay","Kollingbaum, Martin"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F F Ingrand, M P Georgeff and A S Rao.

Provenance is an innovative approach to trace events in complex distributed processes, dependencies between such events, and associated decisions by human actors. We focus on three aspects of provenance in agent-mediated healthcare systems: first, we define the provenance concept and show how it can be applied to agent-mediated healthcare applications; second, we  investigate and provide a method for independent and\r\nautonomous healthcare agents to document the processes they are involved in without directly interacting with each other; and third, we show that this method solves the privacy issues of provenance in agent-mediated healthcare systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kifor, Tamas","Varga, Laszlo Z.","Vazquez-Salceda, Javier","Alvarez, Sergio","Willmott, Steven","Miles, Simon","Moreau, Luc"],"dc:date":"2006-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Groth, S Jiang, S Miles, S Munroe, V Tan, S Tsasakou and L Moreau.

Their success brings the opportunity to publish, share, reuse and repurpose this explicitly captured knowledge. Within the myGrid project, we have identified key resources that can be shared including complete workflows, fragments of workflows and constituent services. We have examined the alternative ways these can be described by their authors (and subsequent users), and developed a unified descriptive model to support their later discovery. By basing this model on existing standards, we have been able to extend existing Web Service and Semantic Web Service infrastructure whilst still supporting the specific needs of the e-Scientist. myGrid components enable a workflow life-cycle that extends beyond execution, to include discovery of previous relevant designs, reuse of those designs, and subsequent publication. Experience with example groups of scientists indicates that this cycle is valuable. The growing number of workflows and services mean more work is needed to support the user in effective ranking of search results, and to support the repurposing process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wroe, Chris","Goble, Carole","Goderis, Antoon","Lord, Phillip","Miles, Simon","Papay, Juri","Alper, Pinar","Moreau, Luc"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2005).

To this end, a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging workflow was defined, which participants had to either simulate or run in order to produce some provenance representation, from which a set of identified queries had to be implemented and executed. Sixteen teams responded to the challenge, and submitted their inputs. In this paper, we present the challenge workflow and queries, and summarise the participants contributions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moreau, Luc","Ludaescher, Bertram","Altintas, Ilkay","Barga, Roger S.","Bowers, Shawn","Chin, George","Cohen, Shirley","Cohen-Boulakia, Sarah","Clifford, Ben","Davidson, Susan","Deelman, Ewa","Digiampietri, Luciano","Foster, Ian","Freire, Juliana","Frew, James","Futrelle, Joe","Gibson, Tara","Gil, Yolanda","Goble, Carole","Golbeck, Jennifer","Groth, Paul","Holland, David A.","Jiang, Sheng","Kim, Jihie","Krenek, Ales","McPhillips, Timothy","Mehta, Gaurang","Miles, Simon","Metzger, Dominic","Munroe, Steve","Myers, Jim","Plale, Beth","Podhorszki, Norbert","Ratnakar, Varun","Schuchardt, Karen","Seltzer, Margo","Simmhan, Yogesh L.","Slaughter, Peter","Stephan, Eric","Stevens, Robert","Turi, Daniele","Wilde, Mike","Zhao, Jun","Zhao, Yong"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Roger S Barga and Luciano A Digiampietri.

After an experiment has been executed, it is useful for a scientist to verify that the execution was performed correctly or is compatible with some existing experimental criteria or standards, not necessarily anticipated prior to execution. Scientists may also want to review and verify experiments performed by their colleagues. There are no existing frameworks for validating such experiments in today\u0027s e-Science systems. Users therefore have to rely on error checking performed by the services, or adopt other ad hoc methods. This paper introduces a platform-independent framework for validating workflow executions. The validation relies on reasoning over the documented provenance of experiment results and semantic descriptions of services advertised in a registry. This validation process ensures experiments are performed correctly, and thus results generated are meaningful. The framework is tested in a bioinformatics application that performs protein compressibility analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Simon","Wong, Sylvia C.","Fang, Weijian","and, Paul Groth","Moreau, Luc"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K Lanctot, M Li and E h Yang.

In particular, it is based on an open, well-defined data model and architecture, allowing different components of the challenge workflow to independently record documentation, and for the workflow to be executed in any environment. Another noticeable feature is that we distinguish between the data recorded about what has occurred, emphprocess documentation, and the emphprovenance of a data item, which is all that caused the data item to be as it is and is obtained as the result of a query over process documentation. This distinction allows us to tailor the system to separately best address the requirements of recording and querying documentation. Other notable features include the explicit recording of causal relationships between both events and data items, an interaction-based world model, intensional definition of data items in queries rather than relying on explicit naming mechanisms, and emphstyling of\r\n documentation to support non-functional application requirements such as reducing storage costs or ensuring privacy of data. In this paper we describe how each of these features aid us in answering the challenge provenance queries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Simon","Groth, Paul","Munroe, Steve","Jiang, Sheng","Assandri, Thibaut","Moreau, Luc"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Jihie Kim, Ewa Deelman, Yolanda Gil, Gaurang Mehta and Varun Ratnakar.

The process that led to some data is called the provenance of that data, and a provenance architecture is the software architecture for a system that will provide the necessary functionality to record, store and use process documentation. However, there has been little principled analysis of what is actually required of a provenance architecture, so it is impossible to determine the functionality they would ideally support. In this paper, we present use cases for a provenance architecture from current experiments in biology, chemistry, physics and computer science, and analyse the use cases to determine the technical requirements of a generic, technology and application-independent architecture. We propose an architecture that meets these requirements and evaluate a preliminary implementation by attempting to realise two of the use cases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Simon","Groth, Paul","Branco, Miguel","Moreau, Luc"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Addis, J Ferris, M Greenwood, D Marvin, P Li, T Oinn and A Wipat.

While \"workflow compilers\", such as Pegasus, reduce this burden, a further problem arises: since specifying details of execution is now automatic, a workflow\u0027s results are harder to interpret, as they are partly due to specifics of execution. By automating steps between the experiment design and its results, we lose the connection between them, hindering interpretation of results. To reconnect the scientific data with the original experiment, we argue that scientists should have access to the full provenance of their data, including not only parameters, inputs and intermediary data, but also the abstract experiment, refined into a concrete execution by the \"workflow compiler\". In this paper, we describe preliminary work on adapting Pegasus to capture the process of workflow refinement in the PASOA provenance system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Simon","Deelman, Ewa","Groth, Paul","Vahi, Karan","Mehta, Gaurang","Moreau, Luc"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8932176,"sim:weight":0.844979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43080,"sim:weight":0.582203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930718,"sim:weight":0.553866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997443,"sim:weight":0.5297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934698,"sim:weight":0.485437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826990,"sim:weight":0.440588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933386,"sim:weight":0.43763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826704,"sim:weight":0.432657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934609,"sim:weight":0.411641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929831,"sim:weight":0.392832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934553,"sim:weight":0.381354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177337,"sim:weight":0.362989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929226,"sim:weight":0.359064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826906,"sim:weight":0.33076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932989,"sim:weight":0.315242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26045,"sim:weight":0.309348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386709,"sim:weight":0.237658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.237335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.231256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826868,"sim:weight":0.204582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For example, in science, the process that produced a given result must be demonstrably rigorous for the result to be deemed reliable. A provenance system supports applications in recording adequate documentation about process executions to answer queries regarding provenance, and provides functionality to perform those queries. Several provenance systems are being developed, but all focus on systems in which the components are textitreactive, for example Web Services that act on the basis of a request, job submission system, etc. This limitation means that questions regarding the motives of autonomous actors, or textitagents, in such systems remain unanswerable in the general case. Such questions include: who was ultimately responsible for a given effect, what was their reason for initiating the process and does the effect of a process match what was intended to occur by those initiating the process? In this paper, we address this limitation by integrating two solutions: a generic, re-usable framework for representing the provenance of data in service-oriented architectures and a model for describing the goal-oriented delegation and engagement of agents in multi-agent systems. Using these solutions, we present algorithms to answer common questions regarding responsibility and success of a process and evaluate the approach with a simulated healthcare example.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Simon","Munroe, Steve","Luck, Michael","Moreau, Luc"],"dc:date":"2007-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Luck and M d’Inverno.

We incorporate the UML2 superstructure and the UML profile for Quality of Service to provide abstract descriptions of component-and-connector systems. We then define transformations that refine the UML2 models to conform with the Distributed Management Taskforce (DMTF) Common Information Model (CIM) (Distributed Management Task Force Inc. 2006), a schema standard for management and instrumentation of hardware and software. Finally, we provide a mapping the CIM metamodel to a .NET-based metamodel for implementation of the monitoring infrastructure utilising various .NET features including the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) interface.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chan, Kenneth","Poernomo, Iman"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1549752,"sim:weight":0.327494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5843770,"sim:weight":0.272424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5846265,"sim:weight":0.251644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70121,"sim:weight":0.230823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932494,"sim:weight":0.227067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":707246,"sim:weight":0.223717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826914,"sim:weight":0.205683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1549812,"sim:weight":0.191612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59232,"sim:weight":0.184974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1549556,"sim:weight":0.173435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For deterministic systems, the definition is shown to specialise to a simpler form when the information source and the known inputs jointly determine the inputs. For this special case, the definition is related to the classical security condition of non-interference and an equivalence is established between non-interference and independence of random variables. Quantitative information flow for deterministic systems is then presented in relational form. With this presentation, it is shown how relational parametricity can be used to derive upper and lower bounds on information flows through families of functions defined in the second order lambda calculus.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clark, David","Hunt, Sebastian","Malacaria, Pasquale"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Abadi, A Banerjee, N Heintze and J G Riecke.

{"identifier":9767,"ep:Repository":26,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Monodic temporal resolution","bibo:abstract":"Until recently, First-Order Temporal Logic (FOTL) has been only partially understood. While it is well known that the full logic has no finite axiomatisation, a more detailed analysis of fragments of the logic was not previously available. However, a breakthrough by Hodkinson et al., identifying a finitely axiomatisable fragment, termed the monodic fragment, has led to improved understanding of FOTL. Yet, in order to utilise these theoretical advances, it is important to have appropriate proof techniques for this monodic fragment.In this paper, we modify and extend the clausal temporal resolution technique, originally developed for propositional temporal logics, to enable its use in such monodic fragments. We develop a specific normal form for monodic formulae in FOTL, and provide a complete resolution calculus for formulae in this form. Not only is this clausal resolution technique useful as a practical proof technique for certain monodic classes, but the use of this approach provides us with increased understanding of the monodic fragment. In particular, we here show how several features of monodic FOTL can be established as corollaries of the completeness result for the clausal temporal resolution method. These include definitions of new decidable monodic classes, simplification of existing monodic classes by reductions, and completeness of clausal temporal resolution in the case of monodic logics with expanding domains, a case with much significance in both theory and practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Degtyarev, Anatoli","Fisher, Michael","Konev, Boris"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A ARTALE and E FRANCONI.

Where agents are self-interested, or potentially unreliable, there must be appropriate mechanisms to cope with the uncertainty that arises. In particular, agents must manage the risk associated with interacting with others who have different objectives, or who may fail to fulfil their commitments. Previous work has utilised the notions of motivation and trust in engendering successful cooperation between self-interested agents. Motivations provide a means for representing and reasoning about agents\u0027 overall objectives, and trust offers a mechanism for modelling and reasoning about reliability, honesty, veracity and so forth. This paper extends that work to address some of its limitations. In particular, we introduce the concept of a clan: a group of agents who trust each other and have similar objectives. Clan members treat each other favourably when making private decisions about cooperation, in order to gain mutual benefit. We describe mechanisms for agents to form, maintain, and dissolve clans in accordance with their self-interested nature, along with giving details of how clan membership influences individual decision making. Finally, through some simulation experiments we illustrate the effectiveness of clan formation in addressing some of the inherent problems with cooperation among self-interested agents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Griffiths, Nathan","Luck, Michael"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934856,"sim:weight":0.550379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998017,"sim:weight":0.500237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997844,"sim:weight":0.49964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933897,"sim:weight":0.496123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98829,"sim:weight":0.492025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":38006,"sim:weight":0.48564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931792,"sim:weight":0.457962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25806,"sim:weight":0.453775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930807,"sim:weight":0.434766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26006,"sim:weight":0.418467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934037,"sim:weight":0.407697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385398,"sim:weight":0.398578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933831,"sim:weight":0.398398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932184,"sim:weight":0.397314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1339,"sim:weight":0.366808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933069,"sim:weight":0.364219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.357608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.350241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.348665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.346234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These programs are “correct” in the sense that they satisfy their specifications. The technique we use is to extract programs from proofs in formal logic by techniques due to Curry and Howard. The logical calculus, however, is novel because it adds structural rules corresponding to the standard ways of modifying specifications: translating (renaming), taking unions, and hiding signatures. Although programs extracted by the Curry-Howard process can be very cumbersome, we use a number of simplifications that ensure that the programs extracted are in a language close to a standard high-level programming language. We use this to produce an executable refinement of a given specification and we then provide a method for producing a program module that maximally respects the original structure of the specification. Throughout the paper we demonstrate the technique with a simple example.","bibo:AuthorList":["Crossley, John","Poernomo, Iman","Wirsing, Martin"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1347115,"sim:weight":0.238053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86418,"sim:weight":0.221459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394133,"sim:weight":0.204295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108124,"sim:weight":0.202914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1568477,"sim:weight":0.181914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145423,"sim:weight":0.177781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43121,"sim:weight":0.172428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43126,"sim:weight":0.172317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43122,"sim:weight":0.172181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43130,"sim:weight":0.168941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930887,"sim:weight":0.165867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997739,"sim:weight":0.165393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77805,"sim:weight":0.164467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49420,"sim:weight":0.156994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98506,"sim:weight":0.154914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43123,"sim:weight":0.153746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43119,"sim:weight":0.151342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98508,"sim:weight":0.150834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98517,"sim:weight":0.14933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43993,"sim:weight":0.149073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

ADL research focuses on software composed of prefabricated parts, so-called software components. ADLs usually come equipped with rigorous state-transition style semantics, facilitating verification and analysis of specifications. Consequently, ADLs are well suited to configuring distributed and event-based systems. However, additional expressive power is required for the description of enterprise software architectures – in particular, those built upon newer middleware, such as implementations of Java’s EJB specification, or Microsoft’s COM+/.NET. The enterprise requires distributed software solutions that are scalable, business-oriented and mission-critical. We can make progress toward attaining these qualities at various stages of the software development process. In particular, progress at the architectural level can be leveraged through use of an ADL that incorporates trust and dependability analysis. Also, current industry approaches to enterprise development do not address several important architectural design issues. The TrustME ADL is designed to meet these requirements, through combining approaches to software architecture specification with rigorous design-by-contract ideas. In this paper, we focus on several aspects of TrustME that facilitate specification and analysis of middleware-based architectures for trusted enterprise computing systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schmidt, Heinz","Poernomo, Iman","Reussner, Ralf"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Harel.

ADLs usually come equipped with a rigourous\r\nstate-transition style semantics, facilitating specification\r\nand analysis of distributed and event-based systems.\r\nHowever, enterprise system architectures built upon\r\nnewer middleware (implementations of Java’s EJB specification, or Microsoft’s COM+/ .NET) require additional\r\nexpressive power from an ADL. The TrustME ADL is designed\r\nto meet this need. In this paper, we describe several\r\naspects of TrustME that facilitate specification and anlysis\r\nof middleware-based architectures for the enterprise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Poernomo, Iman","Schmidt, Heinz"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"“OMG OMG.

This protocol leads to the expansion of the theory and the production of more powerful programs. The methodology we use for automatically extracting “correct” programs from proofs is a development of the well-known Curry-Howard process. Program extraction has been developed by many authors, but our presentation is ultimately aimed at a practical, usable system and has a number of novel features. These include\r\n1. a very simple and natural mimicking of ordinary mathematical practice and likewise the use of established computer programs when we obtain programs from formal proofs, and\r\n2. a conceptual distinction between programs on the one hand, and proofs of theorems that yield programs on the other.\r\n\r\nAn implementation of our methodology is the Fred system. As an example of our protocol we describe a constructive proof of the well-known theorem that every graph of even parity can be decomposed into a list of disjoint cycles. Given such a graph as input, the extracted program produces a list of the (non-trivial) disjoint cycles as promised.","bibo:AuthorList":["Poernomo, Iman","Crossley, John","Lau, Kung-Kiu"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Manual.

Because of this, dierent communities have made quite distinct underlying assumptions in their models for electronically representing provenance. Approaches deriving from the library and archiving communities emphasise agreed vocabulary by which resources can be described and, in particular, assert their attribution (who created the resource, who modied it, where it was stored etc.) The primary purpose here is to provide intuitive metadata by which users can search for and index resources. In comparison, models for representing the  results of scientific workflows have been developed with the assumption that each event or piece of intermediary data in a process\u0027 execution can and should be documented, to give a full account of the experiment undertaken. These occurrences are connected together by stating where one derived from, triggered, or otherwise caused another, and so form a causal graph. Mapping between the two approaches would be benecial in integrating systems and exploiting the strengths of each. In this paper, we specify such a mapping between Dublin Core and the Open Provenance Model. We further explain the technical issues to overcome and the rationale behind the approach, to allow the same method to apply in mapping similar schemes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Simon"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Dublin Core.

ADLs usually come equipped with a formal dynamic semantics, facilitating specification and analysis of distributed and event-based systems. In this paper, we describe the TrustME, an ADL framework that  provides both a process and a structural view of web service-based systems. We use Petri-net descriptions to give a dynamic view of business workflow for web service collaboration.\r\n\r\nWe adapt the approach of Schmidt to define a form of Meyer\u0027s design-by-contract for configuring workflow architectures.

One method that shows promise for improving recruitment is the use of interactive prompts that inform practitioners of patient eligibility for clinical trials during consultation. This paper presents the ePCRN-IDEA recruitment system, which utilises an agent-based infrastructure to enable real-time recruitment of patients. In essence, whenever patients enter a clinic, the system compares their details against eligibility criteria, which define the requirements of active clinical trials. If a patient is found to be eligible, a prompt is raised to notify the user. In this way, it becomes possible for recruitment to take place quickly in a cost effective manner, whilst maintaining patient trust through the involvement of their own health care practitioner.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tyson, Gareth","Taweel, Adel","Miles, Simon","Luck, Michael","Van Staa, Tjeerd","Delaney, Brendan"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A McDonald, R Knight, M Campbell, V Entwistle, A Grant, J Cook, D Elbourne, D Francis, J Garcia, I Roberts and C Snowdon.

Even though most of them are implemented based on existing general purpose programming languages, e.g. Java, agents are either programmed in a new programming language or Domain-specific Language expressed in XML. As a consequence, this prevents the use of advanced features of the underlying programming language and the integration with existing libraries and frameworks, which are essential for the development of enterprise applications. Due to these limitations of BDI agent platforms, we have implemented the BDI4JADE, which is presented in this paper. It is implemented as a BDI layer on top of JADE, a well accepted agent platform.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nunes, Ingrid","J.P. de Lucena, Carlos","Luck, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R H Bordini, M Wooldridge and J F Hu¨bner.

As a consequence, assisting them in their routine tasks has become a relevant issue to be addressed. In this paper, we introduce a software framework that supports the development of Personal Assistance Software (PAS). It relies on the idea of exposing a high level user model in order to increase user trust in the task delegation process as well as empowering them to manage it. The framework provides a synchronization mechanism that is responsible for dynamically adapting an underlying BDI agent-based running implementation in order to keep this high-level view of user customizations consistent with it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nunes, Ingrid","Barbosa, Simone","Luck, Michael","Lucena, Carlos"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Alur, D Malks and J Crupi.

{"identifier":107724,"ep:Repository":26,"dc:type":["Article","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Automating the product derivation process of multi-agent systems product lines","bibo:abstract":"Agent-oriented software engineering and software product lines are two promising software engineering techniques. Recent research work has been exploring their integration, namely multi-agent systems product lines (MAS-PLs), to promote reuse and variability management in the context of complex software systems. However, current product derivation approaches do not provide specific mechanisms to deal with MAS-PLs. This is essential because they typically encompass several concerns (e.g., trust, coordination, transaction, state persistence) that are constructed on the basis of heterogeneous technologies (e.g., object-oriented frameworks and platforms). In this paper, we propose the use of multi-level models to support the configuration knowledge specification and automatic product derivation of MAS-PLs. Our approach provides an agent-specific architecture model that uses abstractions and instantiation rules that are relevant to this application domain. In order to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have implemented it as an extension of an existing product derivation tool, called GenArch. The approach has also been evaluated through the automatic instantiation of two MAS-PLs, demonstrating its potential and benefits to product derivation and configuration knowledge specification.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cirilo, Elder","Nunes, Ingrid","Kulesza, Uirá","Lucena, Carlos"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.422576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70121,"sim:weight":0.409155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":758551,"sim:weight":0.328186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98690,"sim:weight":0.283851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.278563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":218133,"sim:weight":0.252117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.243051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1928322,"sim:weight":0.239679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99333,"sim:weight":0.233903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930159,"sim:weight":0.228024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98647,"sim:weight":0.224057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103281,"sim:weight":0.222716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710017,"sim:weight":0.218037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931336,"sim:weight":0.212609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77760,"sim:weight":0.201673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385246,"sim:weight":0.193184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45512,"sim:weight":0.191323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61622,"sim:weight":0.187408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":212524,"sim:weight":0.185812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52107,"sim:weight":0.184934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While the full logic is highly complex, recent work on monodic first-order temporal logics has identified important enumerable and even decidable fragments. Although a complete and correct resolution-style calculus has already been suggested for this specific fragment, this calculus involves constructions too complex to be of practical value. In this paper, we develop a machine-oriented clausal resolution method which features radically simplified proof search. We first define a normal form for monodic formulae and then introduce a novel resolution calculus that can be applied to formulae in this normal form. By careful encoding, parts of the calculus can be implemented using classical first-order resolution and can, thus, be efficiently implemented. We prove correctness and completeness results for the calculus and illustrate it on a comprehensive example. An implementation of the method is briefly discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Konev, Boris","Degtyarev, Anatoli","Dixon, Clare","Fisher, Michael","Hustadt, Ullrich"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77020,"sim:weight":0.239376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46095,"sim:weight":0.230882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1927106,"sim:weight":0.227159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999162,"sim:weight":0.222786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934447,"sim:weight":0.213622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1925921,"sim:weight":0.210132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9935,"sim:weight":0.208218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998282,"sim:weight":0.194302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826893,"sim:weight":0.194284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930157,"sim:weight":0.194282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43155,"sim:weight":0.186312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932650,"sim:weight":0.178996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2111921,"sim:weight":0.173728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18282,"sim:weight":0.170533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387124,"sim:weight":0.169571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43062,"sim:weight":0.151796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998220,"sim:weight":0.141138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386777,"sim:weight":0.132824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2009999,"sim:weight":0.130105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67634,"sim:weight":0.103235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The increased use of software in automating activities provides the opportunity to add greatly to the amount we can know about an entityâ??s history and the process by which it came to be as it is. However, it also presents difficulties: querying for the provenance of an entity could potentially return detailed information stretching back to the beginning of time, and most of it possibly irrelevant to the querier.

PrIMe is a software engineering technique for adapting application designs to enable them to interact with a provenance middleware layer, thereby making them provenance-aware.

While this notion of power is critical in the context of organisational dynamics, and has been studied by others in this light, it must be constrained so as to be useful in any practical application. In particular, we are concerned with how power may be used by agents to govern the imposition and management of norms, and how agents may dynamically assign norms to other agents within a multi-agent system. We approach the problem by defining a syntax and semantics for powers governing the creation, deletion, or modification of norms within a system, which we refer to as normative powers. We then extend this basic model to accommodate more general powers that can modify other powers within the system, and describe how agents playing certain roles are able to apply powers, changing the system’s norms, and also the powers themselves. We examine how the powers found within a system may change as the status of norms change, and show how standard norm modification operations — such as the derogation, annulment and modification of norms— may be represented within our system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Oren, Nir","Miles, Simon","Luck, Michael"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G Boella, G Pigozzi and L van der Torre.

Based on this assumption, the CONTRACT project aims to develop and apply electronic contracting and contract-based monitoring and verification techniques in real world applications. This paper presents results from the initial phase of the project, which focused on requirements solicitation and analysis. Specifically, we survey four use cases from diverse industrial applications, examine how they can benefit from an agent-based electronic contracting infrastructure and outline the technical requirements that would be placed on such an infrastructure. We present the designed CONTRACT architecture and describe how it may fulfil these requirements. In addition to motivating our work on the contract-based infrastructure, the paper aims to provide a much needed community resource in terms of use case themselves and to provide a clear commercial context for the development of work on contract-based system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jakob, Michal","Pechoucek, Michal","Miles, Simon","Luck, Michael","Chabera, Jiri","Oren, Nir","Kollingbaum, Martin","Holt, Camden","Vazquez, Javier","Storms, Patrick","Dehn, Martin"],"dc:date":"2008-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R A Belecheanu.

However, with the increasing amount of available services that differ in granularity (amount of functionality provided) and qualities, selecting the best combination of services becomes very complex. In response, this paper addresses the challenges of service selection, and makes a twofold contribution. First, a rich representation of compositional planning knowledge is provided, allowing the expression of multiple decompositions of tasks at arbitrary levels of granularity. Second, two distinct search space reduction techniques are introduced, the application of which, prior to performing service selection, results in significant improvement in selection performance in terms of execution time, which is demonstrated via experimental results.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barakat, Lina","Miles, Simon","Poernomo, Iman","Luck, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Sirin, B Parsia, D Wu, J Hendler and D Nau.

Much software exists, and is being developed, for which there is no provenance-awareness, i.e. at best, the data it outputs can be connected to its inputs, but with no record of intermediate processing. Further, where some record of processing does exist, e.g. as logs, it is not in a form easily connected with that of other processes. We would like to enable compiled software to record useful documentation without requiring prior manual adaptation. In this paper, we present an approach to adapting source code from its original form without manual manipulation, to record information on data provenance during execution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Simon"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In order to perform such pre-signing procedures, this agent has to be capable of computing a policy taking into account the norms and sanctions in the contracts. In relation to this, the contribution of this work is threefold. First, we present the Normative Markov Decision Process, an extension of the Markov Decision Process for explicitly representing norms. In order to illustrate the usage of our framework, we model an example in a simulated aerospace aftermarket. Second, we specify an algorithm for identifying the states of the process which characterize the violation of norms. Finally, we show how to compute policies with our framework and how to calculate the risk of violating the norms in the contracts by adopting a particular policy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fagundes, Moser","Ossowski, Sascha","Luck, Michael","Miles, Simon"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Casali, L Godo and C Sierra.

Was this quote from the New York Times modified? Daily, we rely on data from the Web but often it is difficult or impossible to determine where it came from or how it was produced. This lack of provenance is particularly evident when people and systems deal with Web information or with any environment where information comes from sources of varying quality. Provenance is not captured pervasively in information systems. There are major technical, social, and economic impediments that stand in the way of using provenance effectively. This paper synthesizes requirements for provenance on the Web for a number of dimensions focusing on three key aspects of provenance: the content of provenance, the management of provenance records, and the uses of provenance information. To illustrate these requirements, we use three synthesized\r\nscenarios that encompass provenance problems faced by Web users today.","bibo:AuthorList":["Groth, Paul","Gil, Yolanda","Cheney, James","Miles, Simon"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Artz and Y Gil.

While the full logic is highly complex, recent work on monodic first-order temporal logics has identified important enumerable and even decidable fragments. In this paper, we develop a clausal resolution method for the monodic fragment of first-order temporal logic over expanding domains. We first define a normal form for monodic formulae and then introduce novel resolution calculi that can be applied to formulae in this normal form. We state correctness and completeness results for the method. We illustrate the method on a comprehensive example. The method is based on classical first-order resolution and can, thus, be efficiently implemented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Konev, Boris","Degtyarev, Anatoli","Dixon, Clare","Fisher, Michael","Hustadt, Ullrich"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"B KONEV, A DEGTYAREV, C DIXON, M FISHER and U HUSTADT.

Following model driven engineering techniques, Ontology Charts can be transformed to temporal Database schemas, class diagrams and component diagrams, which can then be used to produce software systems. A nice property of these transformations is that resulting system design models lend themselves to complicated extensions that do not require changes to the design models. For example, resulting databases can be extended with new types of data without the need to modify the database schema of the legacy system. Semantic Analysis is not widely used in software engineering, so there is a lack of experts in the field and no design patterns are available.  This make it difficult for the analysts to pass organizational knowledge to the engineers. This study describes an implementation that is readily usable by engineers, which includes an automated technique that can produce a prototype from an Ontology Chart. The use of such tools should enable developers to make use of Semantic Analysis with minimal expertise of ontologies and MDA.","bibo:AuthorList":["Poernomo, Iman","Tsaramirsis, George"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Even when software generates data, users ultimately decide to execute software procedures, choose their configuration and inputs, reconfigure, halt and restart processes, and so on. Understanding the provenance of data thus involves understanding the reasoning of users behind these decisions, but demanding that users explicitly document decisions could be intrusive if implemented naively, and impractical in some cases. In this paper, therefore, we explore an approach to transparently deriving the provenance of user decisions at query time. The user reasoning is simulated, and if the result of the simulation matches the documented decision, the simulation is taken to approximate the actual reasoning. The plausibility of this approach requires that the simulation mirror human decision -making, so we adopt an automated process explicitly modelled on human psychology. The provenance of the decision is modelled in OPM, allowing it to be queried as part of a larger provenance graph, and an OPM profile is provided to allow consistent querying of provenance across user  decisions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nunes, Ingrid","Chen, Yuhui","Miles, Simon","Luck, Michael","Lucena, Carlos"],"dc:date":"2012-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8929226,"sim:weight":0.528915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826703,"sim:weight":0.496324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826868,"sim:weight":0.420193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1440872,"sim:weight":0.3654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26045,"sim:weight":0.296627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
