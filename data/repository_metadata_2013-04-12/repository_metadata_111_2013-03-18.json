Factors associated with approach and escalation","bibo:abstract":"Abnormal approach and escalation from communication to physical intrusion are central concerns in managing risk to prominent people. This study was a retrospective analysis of police files of those who have shown abnormal attentions toward the British Royal Family. Approach (n \u003d 222), compared with communication only (n \u003d 53), was significantly associated with specific factors, most notably serious mental illness and grandiosity. In a sample of those who engaged in abnormal communication (n \u003d 132), those who approached (n \u003d 79) were significantly more likely to evidence mental illness and grandiosity, to use multiple communications, to employ multiple means of communication, and to be driven by motivations that concerned a personal entitlement to the prominent individual. Logistic regression produced a model comprising grandiosity, multiple communications, and multiple means of communication, for which receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to those for other target groups.","bibo:AuthorList":["Darnley, Brian J","James, David V","Meloy, J Reid","Mullen, Paul E","Pathé, Michele T","Farnham, Frank R","Preston, Lulu F"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"JamesDV MullenPE and Meloy JR.

Chapters address:\r\nClinical applications in diverse settings across the age range. \r\nThe relevance of psychoanalytic thinking to the practice of CBT, psychosomatics and general psychiatry \r\nThe contribution of psychoanalytic thinking to mental health policy and the politics of conflict and mediation. \r\n\r\nThis book suggests that psychoanalysis has a vital position within the public health sector and discusses how it can be better utilised in the treatment of a range of mental health problems. It also highlights the role of empirical research in providing a robust evidence base.\r\n\r\nOff the Couch will be essential reading for those practicing in the field of mental health and will also be useful for anyone involved in the development of mental health and public policies.

{"identifier":10104,"ep:Repository":111,"dc:type":["Book","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Standing on their own feet. You and your younger adolescent","bibo:abstract":"Synopsis:\r\nYoung children are cute and delightful or are having temper tantrums. Primary school children are eager and enthusiastic; gaining mastery of their world; defiant and difficult at times, but still mainly wanting to please, responding to suggestions and requirements. Then comes adolescence and the rules of engagement change. Young adolescents aged ten to fourteen years are still legally children: parents or carers are responsible for them and their behaviour. However, these young people begin to see themselves as separate independent individuals. Friendships become more intense and the peer group becomes increasingly significant. External issues can be vital: clothes, hair style, make up, activities, behaviour in school or outside all come to signify to which group the young person belongs. Home and the family become less and less important...\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\u0027Early adolescence is a time of change, challenge and fun. Young people are rather like preschool children and want independence, but at the same time need support and firm parenting. Management of these conflicting needs is a developmental process for the young person and their parents.\r\n\r\nThis book starts with developmental issues and describes how the young person must move forward, not only physically but emotionally, in social skills and relationships, and also intellectually and with a moral sense.\r\n\r\nProblems that can occur are considered: psychosocial problems when the young people struggle in their environment and with relationships, and then mental health problems. These latter can be frightening for the young person and it is important to recognise ‘adolescent turmoil’ where the mood and state of mind is distressing but fluctuates over time and is not fixed, and also the more long term difficulties which probably need outside help.\r\n\r\nThe importance of parents is emphasised, for parents to manage the difficulties and hostility and yet to continue to be there when the young person needs help or is in trouble. Young people tend to open up and want to talk just at times when parents are weary and ready for bed. This is acknowledged but parents are encouraged to do their best to be available.\r\n\r\nWriting this book after many years of work with families when they had broken down was an interesting and different experience. Hopefully, despite the perspective being from the very troubled end, the book will provide useful thoughts about how to recognise, and when possible prevent, problems, and to alert parents to what they can manage themselves, and when other help needs to be sought.\u0027\r\n- Judith Trowell \r\n\r\n‘Once upon a time parents celebrated the arrival of puberty with pride, and in many cultures family and community joined together to celebrate this passage from childhood to adulthood and independence. It is sad that today we live in times when this transition is viewed with anxiety and fear. Of course, as ever before, the ex-child comes to this point in his/her life with a mixture of excitement and ambivalent anticipation, but now their parents often experience a sense of isolation and dread, not knowing how to ensure that the next ten to twelve years run smoothly for their child and for themselves. Judith Trowell has had a rich professional life working in a variety of settings and contexts with adolescents and their parents. In this book, she describes and discusses in a lucid and sensitive manner the physical and emotional changes that younger adolescents, aged between 10 and 14 years, go through and how these affect and are influenced by their parents.’\r\n- Dr A.H.

The evidence base.","bibo:abstract":"David Taylor, a consultant psychotherapist at the Tavistock \u0026 Portman NHS Foundation Trust (120 Belsize Lane, London NW3 5BA, UK. Email: dtaylor@tavi-port.nhs.uk), is the clinical lead of the Tavistock Adult Depression Study (a randomised controlled trial of 60 sessions of weekly psychoanalytic psychotherapy v. treatment as usual for patients with chronic, refractory depression). He is a training and supervising psychoanalyst at the Institute of Psychoanalysis. \r\n\r\nThis article argues that the current approach to guideline development for the treatment of depression is not supported by the evidence: clearly depression is not a disease for which treatment efficacy is best determined by short-term randomised controlled trials. As a result, important findings have been marginalised. Different principles of evidence-gathering are described. When a wider range of the available evidence is critically considered the case for dynamic approaches to the treatment of depression can be seen to be stronger than is often thought. Broadly, the benefits of short-term psychodynamic therapies are equivalent in size to the effects of antidepressants and cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT). The benefits of CBT may occur more quickly, but those of short-term psychodynamic therapies may continue to increase after treatment. There may be a ceiling on the effects of short-term treatments of whatever type. Longer-term psychodynamic treatments may improve associated social, work and personal dysfunctions as well as reductions in depressive symptoms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Taylor, David"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A A Abbass, J T Hancock and J Henderson.

Longitudinal findings in the children of women with post-natal depression.","bibo:abstract":"This paper considers how environmental threat may contribute to the child\u0027s use of avoidant strategies to regulate negative emotions, and how this may interact with high emotional reactivity to create vulnerability to conduct disorder symptoms. We report a study based on the hypothesis that interpreting others\u0027 behaviours in terms of their motives and emotions—using the intentional stance—promotes effective social action, but may lead to fear in threatful situations, and that inhibiting the intentional stance may reduce fear but promote conduct disorder symptoms. We assessed 5-year-olds\u0027 use of the intentional stance with an intentionality scale, contrasting high and low threat doll play scenarios. In a sample of 47 children of mothers with post-natal depression (PND) and 35 controls, children rated as securely attached with their mothers at the age of 18 months were better able to preserve the intentional stance than insecure children in high threat scenarios, but not in low threat scenarios. Girls had higher intentionality scores than boys across all scenarios. Only intentionality in the high threat scenario was associated with teacher-rated conduct disorder symptoms, and only in the children of women with PND. Intentionality mediated the associations between attachment security and gender and conduct disorder symptoms in the PND group.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hill , Jonathan et al"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M D Ainsworth and B A Wittig.

Focus psychodynamic formulations can be employed both with inpatients and with outpatients. Studies show good reliability in a research context and acceptable reliability for clinical purposes. Validity will be separately summarized as content, criterion, and construct validity. Validity studies indicate good validity for the individual axes. Numerous studies on the OPD indicate areas of possible improvement, for example for clinical purposes the OPD should be more practically formulated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Von Der Tann, Mattias","Cierpka, M","Grande, T","Rudolf, G","Stasch, M"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Bellak.

The Hopes and Expectations for Treatment Approach (HETA) involves using the assessment for psychotherapy that normally precedes treatment to derive a baseline from which to generate a set of hopes/expectations as regards the effects of the treatment on the part of parents and the psychotherapist, to be revisited one year after the start of the psychotherapy and/or at its completion. The Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, for parents and schools, was also administered before and after the treatment. The characteristics of the first 30 children referred for psychotherapy over a particular time period are described. Of the first 15 children in this group to complete one year of individual psychotherapy, all showed change or significant change in the areas concerning parents\u0027 and therapists\u0027 hopes at the end-of-year review, as rated by parents and psychotherapists. A case of a child with conduct disorder is used to describe how the assessment generated a psychoanalytic formulation, how the therapist\u0027s understanding was fed back to the parents, and how the parents\u0027 and therapist\u0027s hopes and expectations were derived and recorded. This case illustrates powerfully the impact of trauma in the parents\u0027 backgrounds on the internal world of the child, and how the method provides a useful bridge between parent and child work. Feedback from the psychotherapists, the parents and the referrers using the framework is reviewed, and in conclusion the paper argues for the framework\u0027s value in promoting good practice in the treatment and management of complex cases and in enhancing awareness of the nature and scope of the psychotherapy process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Urwin, Cathy"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P BARROWS.

The various uses of the word \u0027trauma\u0027 are explored and its application to the refugee context is examined. It is proposed that refugees\u0027 response to adversity is not limited to being traumatized but includes resilience and Adversity-Activated Development (AAD). Particular emphasis is given to the distinction between resilience and AAD. The usefulness of the \u0027Trauma Grid\u0027 in the therapeutic process with refugees is also discussed. The Trauma Grid avoids global impressions and enables a more comprehensive and systematic way of identifying the individual refugee\u0027s functioning in the context of different levels, i.e. individual, family, community and society/culture. Finally, I discuss implications for therapeutic work with refugees.","bibo:AuthorList":["Papadopoulos, Renos"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G Affleck and H Tennen. (1996).

The significance of timing in ending inpatient work","bibo:abstract":"This paper discusses work with young people during their stay on an NHS psychiatric inpatient unit, especially focusing on the end of treatment and the appropriate timing of discharge into the community. When approaching the end of an admission, various factors are considered that seem particularly relevant to the decision of when a young person may be ready to leave and cope with the transition back to life outside the unit. Indications of medical stability, in patients where this has been an issue, is a factor of prime importance. Other important factors include family functioning; the availability of adequate ongoing local CAMHS support for the child and family; suitable school provision; and the identity of the child within a peer group. The reality of NHS resources and the demand for inpatient beds is another pressing consideration. The young person\u0027s own motivation emerges as crucial at this stage - towards the end of treatment - not only in terms of what is said, and therefore evident verbally, but also through signs of internal shifts in the child that indicate a capacity to re-engage with life outside in a lasting way. Decisions about when to stop are taken with all this in mind and when the decision does not seem straightforward, it can provoke considerable anxiety in the multi-disciplinary team. Clinical material from psychotherapy with a young adolescent boy with anorexia nervosa is used to illustrate some of the dilemmas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gustavus-Jones, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J ANDERSON.

A cross sectional investigation","bibo:abstract":"Background\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, specialist treatment and intervention services for doctors are underdeveloped. The MedNet programme, created in 1997 and funded by the London Deanery, aims to fill this gap by providing a self-referral, face-to-face, psychotherapeutic assessment service for doctors in London and South-East England. MedNet was designed to be a low-threshold service, targeting doctors without formal psychiatric problems. The aim of this study was to delineate the characteristics of doctors utilising the service, to describe their psychological morbidity, and to determine if early intervention is achieved.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nA cross-sectional study including all consecutive self-referred doctors (n \u003d 121, 50% male) presenting in 2002–2004 was conducted. Measures included standardised and bespoke questionnaires both self-report and clinician completed. The multi-dimensional evaluation included: demographics, CORE (CORE-OM, CORE-Workplace and CORE-A) an instrument designed to evaluate the psychological difficulties of patients referred to outpatient services, Brief Symptom Inventory to quantify caseness and formal psychiatric illness, and Maslach Burnout Inventory.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nThe most prevalent presenting problems included depression, anxiety, interpersonal, self-esteem and work-related issues. However, only 9% of the cohort were identified as severely distressed psychiatrically using this measure. In approximately 50% of the sample, problems first presented in the preceding year. About 25% were on sick leave at the time of consultation, while 50% took little or no leave in the prior 12 months. A total of 42% were considered to be at some risk of suicide, with more than 25% considered to have a moderate to severe risk. There were no significant gender differences in type of morbidity, severity or days off sick.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nDoctors displayed high levels of distress as reflected in the significant proportion of those who were at some risk of suicide; however, low rates of severe psychiatric illness were detected. These findings suggest that MedNet clients represent both ends of the spectrum of severity, enabling early clinical engagement for a significant proportion of cases that is of importance both in terms of personal health and protecting patient care, and providing a timely intervention for those who are at risk, a group for whom rapid intervention services are in need and an area that requires further investigation in the UK.","bibo:AuthorList":["Garelick, Antony","Gross, Samantha R","Richardson, Irene","Von Der Tann, Mattias","Bland, Julia","Hale, Rob"],"dc:date":"2007-08-28","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B Bergman, F Ahmad and Steward DE.

Evaluating an emotionally containing model of professional development","bibo:abstract":"Despite official endorsement of attachment principles in nursery work, these are often not translated into nursery practice. One possible reason for this is that staff training does not sufficiently address the personal implications and anxieties that children\u0027s attachments may entail for practitioners. Working from a psychoanalytic perspective on organisational functioning and group learning, this paper describes action research with a group of nursery heads who participated in a professional development programme designed specifically to explore emotional experience in professional work. The positive evaluations of the programme by heads and their staff are described including examples of experiential learning and of increased staff awareness about, and responsiveness to, the emotional experience of children. However, the research also concluded that sustained effectiveness of the model is likely to be dependent on an ongoing culture of attention to the emotional experience of nursery staff within nursery umbrella organisations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dearnley, Katy","Elfer, Peter"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Bain and L Barnett.

It proposes that one way of characterizing this direction of movement is that it is focusing around the experiences, challenges and dilemmas, both conscious and unconscious, being presented by lateral relations. The paper offers a provisional definition of ‘lateral relations’ and seeks to explore and test this against experiences in two consultancy assignments, in the private and public sectors, respectively. Both touch on themes of anxiety and vulnerability: in the dismantling of prior expectations and assumptions, and in the face of what might be termed the nakedness of being on one\u0027s own, with colleagues. The concluding section of the paper speculates on ways in which these developments may both challenge and affect our more familiar organizational and group relations paradigms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Armstrong, David"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Armstrong.

The missing link between joint attention and imitation","bibo:abstract":"In this paper we outline our hypothesis that human intersubjective engagement entails identifying with other people. We tested a prediction derived from this hypothesis that concerned the relation between a component of joint attention and a specific form of imitation. The empirical investigation involved “blind” ratings of videotapes from a recent study in which we tested matched children with and without autism for their propensity to imitate the self-/other-orientated aspects of another person\u0027s actions. The results were in keeping with three a priori predictions, as follows: (a) children with autism contrasted with control participants in spending more time looking at the objects acted upon and less time looking at the tester; (b) participants with autism showed fewer “sharing” looks toward the tester, and although they also showed fewer “checking” and “orientating” looks, they were specifically less likely to show any sharing looks; and, critically, (c) within each group, individual differences in sharing looks (only) were associated with imitation of self–other orientation. We suggest that the propensity to adopt the bodily anchored psychological stance of another person is essential to certain forms of joint attention and imitation, and that a weak tendency to identify with others is pivotal for the developmental psychopathology of autism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hobson, Jessica A","Hobson, R Peter"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Adamson and R Bakeman.

A reliable rater blind to diagnosis evaluated features of such mental representations in transcripts of Adult Attachment Interviews from 12 women with BPD and 11 women with dysthymia of similar socioeconomic status (SES), all awaiting psychotherapy. In keeping with three hierarchical (non-independent) a priori predictions regarding the mental representations of women with BPD, the results were that (a) all those with BPD, compared with half the group with dysthymia, displayed HH states of mind; (b) those with BPD manifested a significantly higher frequency of globally devaluing representations; and (c) they exhibited a strong trend toward identifying with the devalued hostile caregiver (58% BPD vs. 18% dysthymic). In addition, significantly more BPD than dysthymic patients made reference to controlling behavior towards attachment figures in childhood. These findings offer fresh insights into the nature of BPD and extend previous evidence concerning affected individuals\u0027 patterns of thinking and feeling about childhood attachment figures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hobson, R Peter","Lyons-Ruth, Karlen","Melnick, Sharon","Patrick, Matthew"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H R Agrawal, J Gunderson, B M Holmes and K Lyons-Ruth.

Such a model depends on the development of hard-won capacities, and the descriptions offered here, both by students and by experienced staff, fully demonstrate the immense relevance of the approach, both to training and to a wide variety of work situations. The book outlines the process of the method itself, followed by descriptions of a range of settings, both in Britain and abroad, in which that method has been successfully applied. The contributors draw on experiences across age, culture, and race in, for example, schools, hospitals, residential homes, in a prison, and in a refugee community. The final chapter explores the implications of work discussion for research and policy-making more generally. Many of the situations narrated here are extreme, whether in terms of disturbance or of vulnerability, but they offer moving insights into how effective the method can be and how truly impressive a developmental model it provides.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rustin, Margaret","Rustin, Margaret","Bradley, Jonathan"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.63004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103204,"sim:weight":0.603265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43804,"sim:weight":0.60302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382095,"sim:weight":0.600817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.579209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.571394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.568934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48296,"sim:weight":0.568522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43177,"sim:weight":0.566576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.566539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50140,"sim:weight":0.565273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75264,"sim:weight":0.55978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101271,"sim:weight":0.556179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46776,"sim:weight":0.555088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43864,"sim:weight":0.549319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.54595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77181,"sim:weight":0.54037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.534476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45831,"sim:weight":0.532546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48318,"sim:weight":0.529857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Theoretical questions raised by later authors, informed by clinical work with children who have suffered deprivation and trauma in infancy, are then considered. Theoretical ideas are illustrated with reference to observational material of a little boy who suffered deprivation and trauma in infancy. He was first observed in the middle of his first year of life while he was living in foster care, and then later at the age of two years and three months, when he had been living with his adoptive parents for more than a year.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fitzgerald, Anna"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K Abraham.

Recent government investments aim to ameliorate widely criticised services for adolescence, and redress the negative images of young people. In order to explore the current state of knowledge regarding adolescent mental health, and relate this knowledge to practice, this paper explores three key questions: are adolescent mental health problems increasing, are adolescents dislocated by new and different contexts, and what are the levels of mental health difficulties in adolescence? The paper suggests that evidence that adolescents are \u0027getting worse\u0027 is not convincing, but it is clear that the contexts for adolescence have changed radically and this affects adolescent developmental processes. Adolescent mental health difficulties require a current, developmentally relevant and oriented approach to enhance effective understanding and intervention. Adults in general and professionals in particular need to be able to engage with and not take flight from the impact of adolescent emotionality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Briggs, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Anderson.

Using illustrations from three social work doctoral research projects undertaken by students at the Tavistock Clinic and the University of East London the paper examines four themes that seem to the author to be central to meaningful practice-near research undertaken in a spirit of true emotional and epistemological open-mindedness: the smell of the real; losing our minds; the inevitability of personal change; and the discovery of complex particulars.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cooper , Andrew"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Archer, R Bhaskar, A Collier, T Lawson and A Norrie.

The paper focuses on a particular phase of the methodology: the validation through external expert replication. Data of cases from psychoanalytic treatment, analysed by the originating group in Germany, is analysed by a group in London, UK, which formed to undertake the task of blind comparison. We describe the contribution of this method in the field of psychoanalytic research, the method developed for generating data and the processes through which data are analysed. We demonstrate the comparative findings from the first (German) and second (UK) analyses and explore the meanings of the similarities and differences.

Good medical communicators have fewer complaints in their careers.1 They cost their employers and insurers less in negligence claims. Doctors who communicate well are better at putting patients at their ease. They are more likely to be given the right information, to make the right diagnosis and to recommend the most appropriate treatment (which patients are then more likely to take).2 They will be able to cope with the large proportion of cases where people want to discuss their lives as well as their bodies. There is, in fact, an inextricable link between good communication and simply being a good doctor. The lack of any requirement for working doctors to keep improving their communication skills, as they have to do with their other skills, isn’t just surprising.

The scheme has had a lot of publicity in the UK. It been promoted in particular by Lord Richard Layard, an economist with an interest in mental health, and it has won great favour recently with the British government.1 The aim is to train several thousand mental health workers in a short space of time to deliver the therapy in centres throughout the country.

A cross-sectional study was conducted\r\nto identify potential associations among preoccupied and fearful attachment styles, recollections of parental caregiving, and three types of dysfunctional cognition. The findings confirmed the hypotheses that preoccupied and fearful attachment in adult relationships, as well as\r\nproblematic caregiving in childhood, were associated with depressiogenic and other dysfunctional cognition, most notably generalisation. A motivational hypothesis of cognitive dysfunction is discussed: generalisation may constitute a sub-optimal mechanism of achieving stability in a precarious attachment representation at the cost of increasing vulnerability to depression.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tsalta, Assi","Sochos, Antigonos"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269941,"sim:weight":0.319837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22707,"sim:weight":0.313585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84835,"sim:weight":0.290404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14564,"sim:weight":0.28962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103202,"sim:weight":0.279831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22778,"sim:weight":0.273781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108996,"sim:weight":0.241613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101445,"sim:weight":0.153548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631464,"sim:weight":0.152374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46759,"sim:weight":0.143455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447314,"sim:weight":0.139652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181102,"sim:weight":0.132084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187453,"sim:weight":0.124907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99436,"sim:weight":0.123529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158045,"sim:weight":0.114347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101469,"sim:weight":0.113397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46468,"sim:weight":0.11307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156755,"sim:weight":0.112286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4161240,"sim:weight":0.111632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23219,"sim:weight":0.109479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Given the silence surrounding this form of abuse within the field, there is much to be learned by research focusing on its meaning. This research study examined violence and abuse in the couple’s relationships of gay men from a British perspective. The study is located within a phenomenological approach, designed to capture the essence of the individual’s experience. The choice of a grounded theory approach for the analysis of the data rested on it being particularly helpful in generating theory in areas where this is lacking. However, the challenge of recruiting participants to the study limited the utility of the method, highlighting the ongoing difficulty of gaining access to sexual minority participants for studies involving sensitive issues. Eight participants, all gay men, were recruited and semi-structured interviews administered as a basis for generating data. A focus group discussion also formed part of the study and considered the\r\nquestion of whether same-sex partner abuse is the same or different from that seen in heterosexual couple’s relationships. Findings suggest that love for one’s\r\npartner, hope for change and quality of sex, accounted for the ongoing investment made by these men in their violent and abusive relationships. The emphasis on physical abuse diminished the importance of other forms of abuse,\r\ni.e. emotional, psychological and financial abuse. The direction of the abuse was in contrast to that seen in heterosexual relationships, i.e. the partner with most instrumental power, was the one most at risk of abuse. There was little recognition of the impact of homophobia or internalized homophobia as possible contributory factors in the development of violence and abuse.\r\nParticipants tended to rely on their own resources rather than seeking outside help and the clinical implications of this were considered.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mc Cann, Damian"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"ACON.

A thematic analysis of change in a deprived boy in long-term foster care, during intensive psychoanalytic psychotherapy","bibo:abstract":"This research is based on a single case study of psychoanalytic therapy with a young adolescent boy in care. It is part of a growing movement to identify research methods for exploring the place of unconscious expectations, emotion and affect, in relationships. It experiments with methods for testing out psychoanalytic theory and contributing findings to evidence, modify or expand theory in new directions.\r\nThe patient Simon, had a history of deprivation and showed many features of ADHD and oppositional conduct disorder. The research locates him in a “family” of children who share histories of early traumas and serious behavioural difficulties. Therefore findings, while grounded in clinical material from a single case, and restricted in scope, are of relevance to work with a very needy and challenging population of children, who are often a major cause of concern to their carers, teachers, social workers and to mentalhealth professionals.\r\nThe research examines clinical material through the framework of Bion’s theoretical claim that identifies thinking as at bottom an emotional process, and relates symbolic capacity to early emotional experiences of communication and containment. The framework was selected because of its relevance to the particular features of the patient, which emerged through the detailed study of session records. The analysis of patient therapist\r\ninteraction follows Bion in looking at thinking and learning, side by side with the sort of internal objects active in the therapeutic relationship, and the emotions\r\nconnected to them. \r\nThrough a detailed focus on these aspects of clinical material, the author assesses some current ideas about what interferes with a deprived child’s capacity to think and learn from experience; and what are the factors in a therapeutic relationship that can help a child’s capacity in these areas to grow.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ryan, Emily"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Ainsworth and S M Bell.

The 28 students, who were randomly allocated to three groups (SPS group, Balint group starting at baseline and Balint group starting at 3 months and acting as partial controls), were rated on a questionnaire testing their knowledge of emotional and psychodynamic aspects of the doctor-patient relationship administered at baseline, at 3 months and at 1 year. \r\n\r\nResults:\r\nAt 3 months, students in the SPS and Balint groups scored higher than the partial control group, the difference approaching significance at the 5% level. At 1 year, participation in either teaching method led to significantly higher scores compared with baseline. \r\n\r\nClinical implications:\r\nPsychodynamic psychotherapy teaching methods are effective in increasing students’ knowledge of the doctor-patient relationship and potentially also improving their communication skills.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yakeley, Jessica","Majid, Sarah","Shoenberg , Peter","Morris, Peter","Sturgeon, Richard"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"St Claire L.
