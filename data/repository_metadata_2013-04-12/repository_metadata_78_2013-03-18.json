The setting consisted of two YOTs, one in an inner-city area and the other in a rural/semi-urban area, where primary mental health\r\nworkers operate at the interface between YOTs and the specialist child and adolescent mental health services. Seventeen YOT professionals participated in four focus groups. Four themes were identified: previous experiences of specialist mental health services; issues of interagency working; the role of the primary mental health worker within the YOT; and recommendations for the future. Overall, the clinical component of the role (assessment and\r\nintervention), and the accessibility and responsiveness of the mental health staff were consistently valued, while there were mixed responses on role definitions within the team, consultation and training. It is concluded that\r\nmental health service provision through primary mental health workers is a useful model for interagency partnerships for high-risk client groups with multiple and complex mental health needs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Callaghan, J.","Young, B.","Pace, F.","Vostanis, P."],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Arcelus, F Gale and P Vostanis.

The mental health characteristics of 60 young people consecutively referred to these PMHWs, the assessment outcome and interventions offered, are described. In addition to the anticipated concerns about oppositional/aggressive\r\nbehaviour, young people were referred for a range of mental health problems. There were high levels of emotional problems, self-harm, peer and family relationships difficulties, and school non-attendance. PMHWs offered a range of direct interventions, as well as consultation to YOT staff. The service findings indicate the usefulness of such an inter-agency model in strengthening the links between specialist CAMHS and YOTs, and providing an accessible, responsive and effective service to a needy group of young people.","bibo:AuthorList":["Callaghan, J.","Pace, F.","Young, B.","Vostanis, P."],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2001).

The team combines primary mental health worker, psychology and\r\npsychiatry skills. It offers telephone and face-to-face consultation to local authority staff, assessment, treatment and training. Forty-five children and their carers, who\r\nconsecutively attended the service, were independently assessed by a researcher at the time of referral and at five-month follow-up. Outcome measures included the\r\nStrengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) and a service satisfaction questionnaire. At 5 months, children had significantly improved on a number of HoNOSCA scales, and on the emotional SDQ scales. Carers perceived the interventions as targeting different aspects of the child’s functioning, but wished they were more involved in decision-making. Carers and children were generally positive about their clinical contact. The findings are discussed in the context of developing mental health services for vulnerable children and young people, and interagency partnership.","bibo:AuthorList":["Callaghan, J.","Young, B.","Pace, F.","Vostanis, P."],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Arcelus, T Bellerby and P Vostanis.

Gaining access to children as researchers","bibo:abstract":"When researching with children, challenges of gaining ethically appropriate access to data to support their worlds are well documented (Hood et al., 1996; Lewis and Porter, 2005). Within an educational research context, studies locating children aged eight and under as researchers in their own lives are less well documented (Clark and Moss, 2001), despite evidence suggesting the feasibility of this (Gelman and Wellman, 1991; Gopnik and Meltzoff, 1996). This paper reports and reflects on a range of access issues experienced during an ethnographic case study located within constructivist grounded theory (Siraj-Blatchford, and Siraj-Blatchford, 2001; Charmaz, 2006), conducted in England in three early childhood education and care settings inhabited by children (n\u003d150) aged 4-8 years and five of the children’s own homes). The enquiry also engaged sixteen experienced researchers from two university education departments.  Conducted within the British Educational Research Association’s ethical parameters (2004), this enquiry was concerned with ascertaining young children’s potential as researchers in their own lives. For the purposes of the study, a defining rubric of researcher behaviours was empirically established and applied to the identification of research activity undertaken by young children in their everyday contexts. The children had undertaken no formal research methods training. Nested within a dual context of educational mangerialism and heightened media and government policy focus on safeguarding, the enquiry presented a number of challenges in terms of accessing data.

In particular, in high-rise structures traction drive elevators they are employed as a means of car and counterweight suspension and for compensation of tensile forces over the traction sheave. Also, ropes are applied in the elevator governor systems to activate the safety gear in order to bring the car and counterweight safely to rest in the event of emergency and failure of the normal stopping system. An adverse situation arises when the host structure is excited near its fundamental natural frequency and vibrates harmonically. This often results in a passage through resonance conditions in the rope system when the slowly varying natural frequencies of the ropes approach the frequency of the inertial load resulting from the building sway. The nature of such a loading is usually nondeterministic and it is necessary to apply stochastic models to analyze the dynamic responses of the ropes. In this paper a model to describe the lateral dynamic behaviour of a vertical moving rope is developed. The model takes into account the fact that the longitudinal elastic stretching of the ropes is coupled with their transverse motions which results in cubic nonlinear terms. The governing nonstationary nonlinear equations are then solved numerically to investigate the passage through resonance conditions arising during the elevator travel. Then, the methodology to account for the stochastic nature of the building sway is discussed and the differential equations governing the second-order statistical moments of the state vector are developed. The stochastic differential equations are treated numerically to predict the variance of the rope response.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kaczmarczyk, S.","Iwankiewicz, R.","Terumichi, Y."],"dc:date":"2010-07-23","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N J Cook.

The need to consider the behaviour of passengers travelling in the car complicates the procedure further. This paper presents an original approach to identify the stiffness and damping characteristics of an elevator car system in order to investigate the effect of passenger load on the dynamic response. A simplified model is developed and the experimental rig with a rectangular elevator platform fixed on the top of four silent blocks attached to a shaker is setup. The transmissibility measurements are carried out with a harmonic excitation applied first to a platform with no passenger load and then to the platform with one passenger within the frequency range of 1 – 20 Hz. A single person standing on the platform is employed in order to assess the passenger’s contribution to the dynamic behaviour of the elevator car system. Curve fitting technique implemented in MATLAB is used to determine the damping and stiffness coefficients both for the empty car system and the car-passenger system. Investigation on the tolerances for both parameters is carried out. An approach to simplify the experimental procedure and to reduce the number of individual tests is proposed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Herrera, I.","Su, H.","Kaczmarczyk, S."],"dc:date":"2010-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27142,"sim:weight":0.416088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27907,"sim:weight":0.408238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101210,"sim:weight":0.320921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.310485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102663,"sim:weight":0.309828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26753,"sim:weight":0.30276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59004,"sim:weight":0.298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45523,"sim:weight":0.27447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26749,"sim:weight":0.270098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28060,"sim:weight":0.265508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269535,"sim:weight":0.255763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60322,"sim:weight":0.25192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68143,"sim:weight":0.251307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24484,"sim:weight":0.250056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57236,"sim:weight":0.236233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.230386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99251,"sim:weight":0.229701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43889,"sim:weight":0.228284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.22596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18157,"sim:weight":0.225229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Particularly water jetting led to better performance. It is \r\ngenerally accepted that factors such as removal of impurities and introducing surface \r\nroughness to steel to obtain better adhesion through the mechanical interlocking of polymeric \r\nstructure and the metal surface play a part. However it is postulated that the ease of \r\nbreakdown of the oxide film is also critically important and varies between surface \r\npreparations. This was investigated in the present study where 5 different surface preparation \r\nmethods (abrasive blasting, water-jetting, abrasion, acid pickling and degreasing) were \r\napplied to the mild steel surface and each resultant surface was characterised using \r\nelectrochemical methods. The Scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) was performed \r\nin dilute saline water to detect anodic and cathodic sites on the surface and also to determine \r\nthe intensity of electrochemical activity at these sites. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) \r\ntogether with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to characterise the \r\nsurface structure and its chemical composition. Changes in open circuit potential have been \r\nmonitored during the time of exposure to electrolyte in order to investigate the general surface \r\nactivity. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to analyse the \r\ncharge transfer situation on the metal surface. Results using these techniques will be presented \r\nand discussed. An anticipated outcome from this work is development of a simple \r\nelectrochemical method to assess that a metal surface is in a condition suitable for coating. \r\nThis could also be used as a way of checking that standard pretreatments had been effective \r\nand assist in the development of new ones","bibo:AuthorList":["Mills, D.","Jamali, S."],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J L Helsel.

However, research evidence is required to provide the evidence base for that professional practice. This need for evidence is becoming more urgent as, for example, funders of health-care services and fee-paying patients are increasingly requiring evidence of efficacy and effectiveness of interventions. In the UK, the move to commissioning of services for the National Health Service is accelerating this trend.\r\n\r\nProfessional bodies should therefore have a role in developing that evidence base as a core part of their business.

In China, organic agriculture - almost completely abandoned as a result of Maoist grain monoculture and Green Revolution technologies by the 1970’s - is making a comeback, with the Organic Food Development Centre, China’s principal organic certifier, winning full accreditation from the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements in 2003 and organic food being produced in China in increasing amounts, albeit from a low base, for sale in both domestic and overseas markets. \r\nBut organic conversion for China’s overwhelmingly poor farmers, as for poor farmers everywhere, is extremely problematic. Not only are there risks of lower yields in the first few years, ignorance of organic techniques, problems of obtaining sufficient organic fertiliser, back-breaking weeding, problems of handling the bureaucratic requirements as well as the monetary costs of certification and finding markets, but owing to the very small size of Chinese farms, farmers need to undertake organic conversion cooperatively. Promoting the necessary conditions for organic agriculture is therefore not easy, particularly in poor, out-of-the-way rural areas. However, the decision by China’s largest and most important state liquor company - Maotai - to source its ingredients, primarily sorghum and wheat, from organic sources has led to the largest concentration of organic farmers in China - in rural Guizhou, one of poorest parts of China - providing farmers with the necessary security to undertake organic conversion with enthusiasm. Our paper will present our research findings, based on visits to Maotai, Guizhou, in 2007 and 2009 and will point to possible lessons for other developing countries who wish to make organic conversion feasible and organic agriculture sustainable over time","bibo:AuthorList":["Sanders, R.","Xiao, X."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46812,"sim:weight":0.427626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81978,"sim:weight":0.332555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447739,"sim:weight":0.271788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313581,"sim:weight":0.267246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316337,"sim:weight":0.251093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67534,"sim:weight":0.240258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26012,"sim:weight":0.22593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26013,"sim:weight":0.22593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.222652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.222652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779676,"sim:weight":0.203151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93477,"sim:weight":0.201605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53524,"sim:weight":0.19842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47132,"sim:weight":0.192512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.189309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710664,"sim:weight":0.186354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108833,"sim:weight":0.176891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106143,"sim:weight":0.171969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.171439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383435,"sim:weight":0.16706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Early programmes addressed crisis situations by, for example, providing qualified teachers for Palestinian refugee children. The first decade of the 21st century has seen ODL emerge as an established and embedded part of national initial teacher education and training provision in both developing and developed countries. ODL has been adopted worldwide as the potential solution to a range of teacher education issues, from cost and supply to access, diversity and quality. In particular, it has been promoted as a key strategy to achieve the World Forum’s Education for All and the United Nation’s Millennium Development Goals. As stated by the World Forum on Education in 2000, ODL offers a means of:\r\n\r\n“ensuring that by 2015 all children, particularly girls, children in difficult circumstances and those belonging to ethnic minorities, have access to and complete free and compulsory primary education of good quality.”\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, the authors discuss a number of questions: Why is ODL used in initial teacher education? Does the use of ODL serve the same purposes in developing and developed countries? What is the impact of information and communication technologies on ODL? What are the key quality challenges ODL in initial teacher education? Finally, the authors consider whether ODL’s potential to achieve the Education for All commitment has been realised","bibo:AuthorList":["Shelton Mayes, A.","Burgess, H.","Danaher, P.","Umar, A."],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109757,"sim:weight":0.544275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.438727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82037,"sim:weight":0.392752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309709,"sim:weight":0.38485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710060,"sim:weight":0.364781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4037,"sim:weight":0.350615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4007,"sim:weight":0.349678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48367,"sim:weight":0.318525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709525,"sim:weight":0.308422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709975,"sim:weight":0.301868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.299679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709535,"sim:weight":0.297233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.273877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387381,"sim:weight":0.273476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18102,"sim:weight":0.269598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383597,"sim:weight":0.268107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108762,"sim:weight":0.262872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709549,"sim:weight":0.261201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2442,"sim:weight":0.251401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3008,"sim:weight":0.250258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Finally, it hoped to raise awareness amongst researchers about good data management practice, including the provision of short and long term data storage and access.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alexogiannopoulos, E.","McKenney, S.","Pickton, M."],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1495139,"sim:weight":0.74707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.500123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.499381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.487207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.483192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.482395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.468577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.462427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The one commonality is that they are all influenced by power, which in turn impacts on how a festival is constructed, delivered and consumed. Clegg (1989) and Prus (1999) believe power and its relationships to be one of the major concepts in the stocial sciences. Church and Coles (2007) are amongst the first writers to point to the influnce of power within tourism; production, governance, and consumption. They conclude that tourism and power cannot be separated, and as a result tourism studies should be explicitly engaged with power discourses. This paper will explore power firstly as a result of the political nature of the stakeholders involved in the creation of a local community festival and secondly through the representations of local community culture from various ethnic groups within the City of Derby. Drawing on observational analysis of the events planning processes, this paper will deconstruct the discourses utilised, deployed and reinvented in the Derby Jubilee Festival. Power is revealed as a pervasive and constructive set of forces that are both enabling and disenfranchising","bibo:AuthorList":["Clarke, A.","Jepson, A."],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N Abercrombie, S Hill and B Turner.

Thus, the main purpose of this research was to explore the role of UK chartered physiotherapists in the process of psychological rehabilitation from sport injuries. This thesis consists of four studies. With the intention to gain further insights into the physiotherapists’ views on the psychological aspects of their work, study one used the Physiotherapists and Sport Psychology Questionnaire (PSPQ; Hemmings \u0026 Povey, 2002) in a national survey with 361 UK chartered physiotherapists working in sport medicine. The results from the survey provided useful insights into the ways in which psychological interventions are currently employed in rehabilitation physiotherapy. In study two, these findings were explored further, by developing a questionnaire survey to explore chartered physiotherapists’ (N \u003d 22) preferred method of sport psychology intervention training. With the purpose of gaining an insight into the physiotherapists’ personal experiences in using psychological interventions with injured athletes, study three adopted a qualitative approach, in which semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven UK chartered physiotherapists. The findings from the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA; Smith, 1996) provided deeper understanding on physiotherapists current knowledge on, and their past experiences and opinions on using range of psychological interventions in their work with injured athletes. Similarly study four used semi-structured interviews and IPA with ten athletes who had previously encountered moderate or severe sport injuries requiring physiotherapy treatment. The findings revealed useful information on the physiotherapists’ role in providing psychological support and using psychological interventions in their work with injured athletes. In conclusion, the research presented in this thesis makes a contribution to knowledge by: (a) providing an insight into the views of chartered physiotherapists in the UK on psychological content of their practice, (b) making preliminary suggestions into how further training in sport psychology for chartered physiotherapists could be delivered, (c) enabling deeper understanding of physiotherapists current practices and past experiences in utilising selected psychological interventions in their work, and (d) giving a voice to injured athletes with regard to the role of physiotherapists in providing psychological support during sport injury rehabilitation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arvinen-Barrow, M."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C B Albinson and T A Petrie.

In 110 subjects (180 feet) aged 18–70 years (mean 52 years) a standardized history and physical examination was undertaken. Clinical parameters associated with HR were evaluated. The Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ) was used to measure health-related quality-of-life dimensions.\r\nResults: Seventy (64%) subjects had bilateral HR and 73 (66%)were female. Mean HR onsetwas 44 (14–68 years) years and median HR duration 6 years (1–33 years). A history of 1st MTPJ trauma presented in 22% of subjects; 74% of whom had unilateral HR. Eighty-four (47%) feet had pes planus based on a positive Foot Posture Index. A correlation between pes planus and 1st MTPJ pain was found (r \u003d 0.84, p \u003d 0.05). In 74% of feet, hallux abductus interphalangeus angle (HAI◦) was greater than normal (≤10◦). A correlation\r\nbetween HAI and reduced 1st MTPJ ROM was found (r \u003d 0.92, p \u003d 0.05). Second toe length was the same as the hallux in 111 feet (62%). A correlation between valgus hallucal rotation and 1st MTP joint pain in HR was found (r \u003d .78, p \u003d .05). A positive relationship was found between 2nd toe length and 1st MTPJ pain (p \u003d 0.001 \u003c 0.05). A correlation between hallucal interphalangeal joint (IPJ) hyperextension and 1st MTPJ pain was found (r \u003d 0.78, p \u003d 0.01). A positive relationship was found between lesser MTPJ pain and supination at propulsion (p \u003c 0.001). There was no evidence of Achilles tendon contracture. The FHSQ results concur with clinical findings.\r\nConclusions: HR was associated with female gender, bilateral involvement, older age groups, increased HAI◦, 2nd toe length similar to hallux, hallucal IPJ hyperextension, lesser MTP joint pain, flat foot and certain gait alterations. HR was not associated with Achilles tendon tightness or footwear. The content validity of clinical parameters of HR needs to be established by formal research prior to their inclusion in\r\na classification of HR","bibo:AuthorList":["Beeson, P.","Phillips, C.","Corr, S.","Ribbans, W."],"dc:date":"2009-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":17924,"sim:weight":0.545437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8793386,"sim:weight":0.471752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43484,"sim:weight":0.412477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57381,"sim:weight":0.405234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26050,"sim:weight":0.296843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146035,"sim:weight":0.293889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43432,"sim:weight":0.290794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.249544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99453,"sim:weight":0.247594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109023,"sim:weight":0.243779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.239815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75274,"sim:weight":0.238504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109129,"sim:weight":0.238058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99077,"sim:weight":0.230101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9553933,"sim:weight":0.228322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.227498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":937081,"sim:weight":0.219229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.214375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101447,"sim:weight":0.213081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780878,"sim:weight":0.203653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The primary aim of this case-control genetic association study was to investigate whether variants within the matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) gene also contributed to both Achilles tendinopathy and Achilles tendon rupture in a Caucasian population. A secondary aim was to establish whether variants within the MMP3 gene interacted with the COL5A1 rs12722 variant to raise risk of these pathologies. \r\nMethods: 114 subjects with symptoms of Achilles tendon pathology and 98 healthy controls were genotyped for MMP3 variants rs679620, rs591058 and rs650108. \r\nResults: As single markers, significant associations were found between the GG genotype of rs679620 (OR \u003d 2.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.90, p \u003d 0.010), the CC genotype of rs591058 (OR \u003d 2.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.50, p \u003d 0.023) and the AA genotype of rs650108 (OR \u003d 4.9, 95% CI 1.0 to 24.1, p \u003d 0.043) and risk of Achilles tendinopathy. The ATG haplotype (rs679620, rs591058, and rs650108) was under-represented in the tendinopathy group when compared to the control group (41% vs 53%, p \u003d 0.038). Finally, the G allele of rs679620 and the T allele of COL5A1 rs12722 significantly interacted to raise risk of AT (p \u003d 0.006). No associations were found between any of the MMP3 markers and Achilles tendon rupture. \r\nConclusion: Variants within the MMP3 gene are associated with Achilles tendinopathy. Furthermore, the MMP3 gene variant rs679620 and the COL5A1 marker rs12722 interact to modify the risk of tendinopathy.

Cadaveric studies have led to the identification of some potential postoperative problems, most commonly weakness of the medial longitudinal arch and pain in the lateral midfoot.\r\nMethods: An electronic search was conducted of the MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Sport-Discus, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and AMED databases. The keywords used to\r\nsearch these databases were plantar fasciotomy and medial longitudinal arch. Articles published between 1976 and 2008 were identified.\r\nResults: Collectively, results of cadaveric studies suggested that plantar fasciotomy leads to loss of integrity of the medial longitudinal arch and that total plantar fasciotomy is more detrimental to foot structure than is partial fasciotomy. In vivo studies, although limited in number, concluded that although clinical outcomes were satisfactory, medial\r\nlongitudinal arch height decreased and the center of pressure of the weightbearing foot was excessively medially deviated postoperatively.\r\nConclusions: Plantar fasciotomy, in particular total plantar fasciotomy, may lead to loss of stability of the medial longitudinal arch and abnormalities in gait, in particular an excessively pronated foot. Further in vivo studies on the long-term biomechanical effects of plantar fasciotomy are required.

First, peak concentric and passive ankle joint moment data were recorded\r\non an isokinetic dynamometer with electromyographic monitoring of the triceps surae; real-time motion analysis of the lower leg and ultrasound imaging of the Achilles-medial gastrocnemius muscletendon junction were simultaneously conducted. Second, the subjects performed six 8-s maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) before repeating the passive and active trials. Although there was no decrease in isometric joint moment after MVICs, peak concentric moment was significantly reduced (11.5%, P _ 0.01). This was accompanied by, and correlated with (r _ 0.90, P _ 0.01), significant reductions in peak triceps surae electromyographic amplitude (21.0%, P _ 0.01). Achilles tendon stiffness (10.9%, P _ 0.01) and passive joint moment (4.9%, P _ 0.01) were also significantly reduced. Third, the subjects performed three 60-s static plantar flexor stretches before being retested 2 and 30 min after stretch. The stretch protocol caused no significant change in any measure. At 30 min after stretching, significant recovery in concentric moment and muscle activity was detected at dorsiflexed joint angles, while Achilles tendon stiffness and passive joint moment remained significantly reduced. These data show that the performance of MVICs interrupts the normal stretchinduced losses in active and passive plantar flexor joint moment and neuromuscular activity, largely because concentric strength and tendon properties were already affected. Importantly, the decrease in\r\nAchilles tendon stiffness remained 30 min later, which may be an important etiological factor for muscle-tendon strain injury risk","bibo:AuthorList":["Kay, A.","Blazevich, A."],"dc:date":"2009-07-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387114,"sim:weight":0.356939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":691728,"sim:weight":0.274868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18176,"sim:weight":0.263708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":967258,"sim:weight":0.258484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494796,"sim:weight":0.232714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1028525,"sim:weight":0.231294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77655,"sim:weight":0.209947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710084,"sim:weight":0.208068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109129,"sim:weight":0.197335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17895,"sim:weight":0.170192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":35502,"sim:weight":0.159122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.158751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81471,"sim:weight":0.158453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664921,"sim:weight":0.157907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":899372,"sim:weight":0.157625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661326,"sim:weight":0.151823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57381,"sim:weight":0.151345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":275728,"sim:weight":0.144762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.143747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10681,"sim:weight":0.141616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Peak active and passive moment data were recorded during plantar flexion trials on an isokinetic dynamometer. Electromyography (EMG) monitoring of the triceps surae muscles, real-time motion analysis of the lower leg, and ultrasound imaging of the Achillesmedial gastrocnemius muscle-tendon junction were simultaneously\r\nconducted. Subjects performed three 60-s static stretches before being retested 2 min and 30 min poststretch. There were three main findings in the present study. First, peak concentric moment was significantly reduced after stretch; 60% of the deficit recovered 30 min poststretch.\r\nThis was accompanied by, and correlated with (r _ 0.81; P _ 0.01) reductions in peak triceps surae EMG amplitude, which was fully recovered at 30 min poststretch. Second, Achilles tendon length was significantly shorter during the concentric contraction after stretch and at 30 min poststretch; however, no change in tendon stiffness was detected. Third, passive joint moment was significantly reduced after stretch, and this was accompanied by significant reductions in medial\r\ngastrocnemius passive muscle stiffness; both measures fully recovered by 30 min poststretch. These data indicate that the stretching protocol used in this study induced losses in concentric moment that were accompanied by, and related to, reductions in neuromuscular activity, but they were not associated with alterations in tendon stiffness or shorter muscle operating length. Reductions in passive moment were associated with reductions in muscle stiffness, whereas tendon mechanics were unaffected by the stretch.

This article reports on research which through survey and interview methods investigated\r\nthe working practices of these colleagues and discusses the different approaches to their deployment in\r\nschools.

The information gathered through self-assessments using these models show the performance of organisations against several model criteria. There is evidence that organisations find it difficult to integrate the information from self-assessments to current business improvement programs or projects. Additionally, it has been claimed that the final reports derived from the deployment of self-assessments are rarely followed up. Thus, despite good efforts and some knowledge gained through the use of BEM’s there is a lack of methods, models, and techniques that effectively integrate the self-assessments with current business improvement strategies. In this context, the effective deployments of BEM’s and follow up activities and plans can contribute to support and develop business improvement strategies. Under this perspective, this paper explores the appropriate methods and techniques than can help to integrate self-assessments outcomes based on the EFQM model into a business improvement strategy. Based on emerging issues derived from an empirical study with twelve European Organisations that have used the EFQM model for more than five years, the paper identifies some of the best practices to integrate self-assessment outcomes with business improvement strategies. It then proposes a framework that can help to accomplish this integration and to mitigate the problems mentioned earlier. The conclusion of this work emphasises the necessity to standardise this process, and to integrate it with current knowledge management projects to store and retrieve the information for future business improvements projects","bibo:AuthorList":["Rocha-Lona, L.","Garza-Reyes, J.","Soriano-Meier, H.","Peacock, T.","Forrester, P."],"dc:date":"2009-07-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Rocha-Lona, S Eldridge, K D Barber and J A Garza-Reyes.

{"identifier":14013,"ep:Repository":78,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Facilitating group work: leading or empowering?","bibo:abstract":"Year two students of the Foundation Degree in Learning and Teaching, study a module relating to special educational needs/inclusion.  Assessment is through a collaborative group project and a personal project diary with a reflective statement.  We felt that the assessment strategy did not sufficiently discriminate between students: virtually all achieved very high grades. Concern was further prompted by awareness of recent research into issues of the fairness, justice and reliability of group work (Maguire and Edmondson 2001, Barnfield 2003, Knight 2004, Skinner et al 2004) and of motivational factors including the effect of rewarding the group product or the individual contribution (Chapman 2002) and issues of inter-relationships in groups (Arango 2007) \r\n\r\n\r\nReflective statements and evaluation feedback from the 2006/7 cohort identified concerns relating to some students acting as ‘passengers’, but being awarded the same high grade for the module as those members who completely engaged with the work. This is a well documented problem identified by others (Ransom 1997, Parsons 2002, Hand 2001, Cheng and Warren 2000).\r\n\r\n In addition the Course Team found tutor guidance was a complicating factor: it was felt that it was a major contributor to the high grades awarded. There was a concern that this facilitation encouraged some students’ lack of engagement by allowing them to be led rather than, as was intended, empowering them to develop their own projects. \r\n\r\nThese observations prompted a reformulation of the assessment strategy for the 07-08 cohort. The weightings were altered from 80% to 60% for the group assessed project and from 20% to 40% for the individual elements. In order to assess the effects of this and to gain insight into issues such as empowerment, especially those involving tutor facilitation, data was collected on the following:\r\nHow the group:\r\n \r\n•\tformed and decided upon the project focus\r\n•\tsustained motivation and whether this was linked to a perception that individual contributions supported the group assessment or individual assessment, or both\r\n•\tmanaged inter-personal professional working relationships\r\n•\tmanaged equitable sharing of the work-load\r\n•\ttheir perceptions and use of the guidance available from the module tutor\r\n\r\nThis involved:\r\n•\tanalysis of 2007-08 students’ diaries and reflective statements \r\n•\tinterviews with 2007-08 students\r\n•\tanalysis of diaries and reflective statements from the 2006-07 cohort\r\n•\tinterviews with students from the 2006-07 cohort asking them to reflect retrospectively on their experiences.\r\n•\tA reflective dairy written by the facilitating tutor for 07-08\r\n\r\nFrom this comparative evaluation we will explore firstly whether the amendments to the assessment weightings made a difference in students’ perceptions of the fairness of the assessment strategy and secondly the effect the level and nature of tutor facilitation had on group dynamics, especially in the areas of, communications, task sharing, empowerment and ownership.   \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the research will have implications for tutors’ thinking about assessment weightings and will throw light on the ethical dilemmas surrounding the issues of the guidance and facilitation of group work","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, J.","Smith, A."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Arango.

Students need to compare their assessment performance against learning goals and be able to close any gaps (Price 2005). Most students grasp basic points but some badly misinterpret feedback (McCune 2004). It is therefore important to explore assessment strategies and feedback processes to determine if feedback influences learning. This primary, qualitative research method recruited a purposive sample of 18 final year students and collected data by exploring student’s experiences of assessment feedback via two focus groups. A pilot group ensured unbiased wording and promoted validity. Ethical approval was provided by the University Ethics Committee. Analysis of transcripts from the taped groups was coded and concept headings generated reflecting the meanings of words and phrases. Concepts were analysed into emerging categories which were compared to the group consensus and used to structure the results (Brown et al. 2005). Results suggest that student’s value specific feedback and mark justification, that they interpret it differently, that feedback is only useful if it helps learning and that the timing of it is crucial. Results are relevant to other learning institutions. Implications for practice are that the quality of feedback needs to be enhanced to promote lifelong learning.\r\n\r\nBrown, L., Herd, K., Humphries, G., Paton, M.

An essential part of lean production is training and education. Training and educating the workforce (what we refer here as “soft investment”) will create the necessary conditions to engage and involve employees in improvement activities, so are indispensable in the implementation of lean production. The aim of this paper is to present a study that explores and contrast the relationship between “soft investments” in lean firms and “soft investments” in traditional firms, by set of hypotheses tests. The hypotheses examine the existing relationship between the two components that conceptualise leanness (managerial commitment towards lean production and real changes made towards the lean direction) and the soft investment, which is assumed to be an infrastructural factor associated with these two components. Data, both quantitative and qualitative, were collected through a survey in conjunction with short structured interviews and planned visits to manufacturing sites of the ceramic industry of North Staffordshire. Two questionnaires were administered at two different levels of the organisation: one to the CEO or general managers and the other to the operations managers with the objective of evaluating the relationship between soft investment and the implementation of lean production. More than 30 firms in the tableware industry of the UK completed the questionnaires. The information collected allowed an analysis of the given hypotheses and the results and conclusions of the study shown that organisations that use lean manufacturing invest significantly more in training the labour force than those that do not","bibo:AuthorList":["Soriano-Meier, H.","Forrester, P.","Garza-Reyes, J.","Peacock, T.","Rocha-Lona, L."],"dc:date":"2009-07-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R F Imrie.

A total of 269\r\nskaters (senior85, junior98, novice86) simultaneously completed the original and a translated version of the Sport\r\nImagery Questionnaire (SIQ; Hall, Mack, Paivio, \u0026 Hausenblas, 1998) twice, first at the beginning of the pre-season (July\r\nAugust 2002) and then during the competitive season (January 2003). Multivariate analyses of variance revealed (all PB\r\n0.05) that senior skaters used more cognitive specific (CS), motivational general-arousal (MG-A), and motivational generalmastery\r\n(MG-M) imagery than junior skaters; differences in CS, cognitive general (CG), MG-A, and MG-M imagery were\r\nfound between senior and novice skaters; between junior and novice skaters, differences were found in CG and MG-A\r\nimagery. Time of season analyses revealed skaters used more CG, MS, and MG-M imagery during the competitive season\r\nthan at the beginning of the pre-season. No significant interaction effect between competitive level and time of season was\r\nobserved. The results are discussed in relation to the applied model of imagery (Martin, Moritz, \u0026 Hall, 1999). To make\r\ncompetitive level transitions less demanding, the results suggest that a psychological skills training programme should be\r\nintroduced for novice synchronized skaters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arvinen-Barrow, M.","Weigand, D.","Hemmings, B.","Walley, M."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Arvinen-Barrow, D A Weigand, B Hemmings and M Walley.

The data from semi-structured in-depth interviews triangulated by document scrutiny and field observations in an English primary school suggest that TAs play a decisive part in creating further capacity within schools by providing a variety of improved services to free teachers from non-teaching related tasks and allowing teachers to focus on their core area of expertise. However, TAs’ role needs to be enhanced and facilitated more professionally based on their skills, experiences and qualifications. \r\nThe paper also discusses the crucial issues at schools in China with the shortage of workforce and the insufficient initial teacher preparation in raising standards of education. By reasoning the initial motive for the call for the school remodeling in both countries and analysing their achievements and the challenges through re-evaluating the role of TAs, the paper draws the insight of having TAs in schools in England to leave the latter time and space for focusing on their professionalism. It could be food for thought to China when it reflects on its teacher educational reform.","bibo:AuthorList":["Feng, Y."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Balshaw and P Farrell.

Since breadth, balance, relevance and differentiation are the four main factors to consider in the process of planning, implementing and assessing curriculum, this essay aims to provide the educators with a critical overview of the curriculum for junior middle schools in China with a focus on the issue of balance. In so doing, the author emphasizes with the support of a range of literature in the UK context the importance of voices of pupils (Garner \u0026 Sandow, 1995, Shevlin \u0026 Rose, 2003) in their intellectual development and academic attainment in regards of curriculum (Byers and Rose 2004, Darling, 1994, Sebba et al 1995). Meanwhile, the author listens to the perspectives of pupils with special educational needs as consumers on the current curriculum in their schools which show a strong desire for a balanced curriculum (Farrell, 1997; Rayner, 1998; McLaughlin \u0026 Tilstone, 2000). The author tends to argue by analyzing the sample curricular in two key junior middle schools of two cities in a province in China that there still exists a lack of balance in the curriculum in terms of the time allocation for the core and peripheral subjects and the balance within individual subjects in teaching and learning. The author thus suggests the decision makers of the curriculum and those who are involved in the implementing of the curriculum listen and respond to the voices as an alternative route to identify the causes for the failure of meeting the expectations of the curriculum by those pupils with special needs and develop a much appropriate balance in curriculum for them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Feng, Y."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Bobbitt.

The growing body of literature on information literacy is focused more often on content and process rather than the transformative impact on learners. The learner needs to be at the heart of the process, especially in the many informal learning engagements with library and information services.\r\n\r\nCombining extensive experience and evidence from small-scale studies in the UK, this paper will argue that in order to create empowered and engaged learners, irrespective of our occupational context, we need to focus on their needs, wants and expectations. This requires us to professionalize our practice in pedagogy.

{"identifier":14046,"ep:Repository":78,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Are the voices of students heard: a case study of the impact of parental and school expectations on the emotional well-being of students in China","bibo:abstract":"Parental and school expectations on children can be influenced by a range of factors (Marjoribanks, 2005, Short, et al. 2001, Chen, et al. 1997, Forrester, et al. 2006). Whether children could eventually meet the expectations depends on their understanding of the expectations, their social and cultural background and their cognitive and behavioural development (Vygotsky 1978, Little, 2005, Canney and Byrne, 2006, McInerney, 2005, Tardif and Miao, 2000, Webster-Stratton, 2002, Aldgate, et al 2006, Jones, 2003, 2006). To illuminate the complexity of issues related to parental and school expectations and the relationships between expectations and students’ emotional well-being, this essay focuses on the identification of the impact of the expectations on the emotional well-being of middle school students in China. Taken the concerns that students may vary in interpreting the expectations, the author investigates the perceptions from students on the expectations. The research aims, first, to provide opportunities for students to articulate their perspectives on the expectations; second, to draw attention from the educators, families and society as a whole to the emotional well-being of students and finally to provide implications for promoting emotional well-being through empowerment.\r\n\r\nCurrently, an overwhelming amount of research shows that emotions are very much part of the life experience and the knowledge of it can lead to success (Buchanan and Hudson, 2000, Salisch, 2001, Goleman, 1996, 2002). Giving children a voice makes them visible in decision-making processes (Jeffs, 1986). The last two decades has witnessed a significant shift from professional ‘knowing best’ towards a culture where students have their views listened and respected to. The shift in the 1980s from advocacy to self-advocacy is seen as a natural extension of the process of empowerment (Garner and Sandow, 1995). The Encouraging Voices Project (Shevlin and Rose, 2003) highlights this shift to a much greater extent. Through empowerment, some research (Canney and Byrne, 2006, Kelly, 1999) demonstrates that children with emotional and behavioural difficulties seem to bring about a marked positive change.\r\n\r\nUnder the current educational reform in China, there is also a call for the listening and responding to student voices. However, research has not yet attached great importance on children’s perspectives because very little exist that describe the feelings and thoughts of children (Sherman 1996). Empirical research has not been conducted as much as that in the developed countries (Wo, 2000, Wo, et al. 2003). The researcher analyses data qualitatively drawn on a questionnaire survey and a semi-structured in-depth interview with a case from junior middle schools in China. She also incorporates multi-methods approach of written work and journal analysis in data triangulation. The self-reflective thinking and perceptions of the researcher as a Chinese parent and educator is also scrutinised. The findings indicate that students regard expectations as either motivations or pressure depending on the nature and degree of expectations. Whilst some students feel quite supported by their parents and schools when communicating about expectations, a large number of students still find it difficult to be understood or listened to. This inevitably influences their emotional well-being negatively. The findings are consistent with much of the previous research conducted internationally but reveal some significant factors which indicate the area of the correlation between student voices and the impact of expectations on them needs further exploring in China. The findings are discussed in light of Chinese cultural values and their influence on the expectations for students. With this small scale research, the author tends to argue that there should also be a paradigm shift in the Chinese educational system in terms of empowerment to students.","bibo:AuthorList":["Feng, Y."],"dc:date":"2007-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L ALEXANDER and R ENTWISLE.

The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of competitive level (elite/novice) and skill-type (open/closed) on athletes\u0027 imagery use. A total of 83 British athletes (39 elite, 44 novice) from open-(n \u003d 40: 23 rugby; 17 martial arts) and closed-skill (n \u003d 43: 28 golf; 15 figure skating) sports completed the Sport Imagery Questionnaire no more than 24 hours prior to competition. MANOVA revealed that main effects due to competitive level and skill-type were significant (p \u003c .05). Univariate analyses revealed that elite athletes used more CS and CG imagery than novices (p \u003c .001), and contrary to previous research findings, athletes in open-skilled sports used more MG-A imagery than those in closed-skill sports (p \u003c .001). Overall, MG-M was the most used imagery type, regardless of competitive level and skill-type. The results are discussed in terms of methodological difficulties, future research, and practical implications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arvinen-Barrow, M.","Weigand, D.","Thomas, S.","Hemmings, B."],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Arvinen-Barrow, D A Weigand, S Thomas, B Hemmings and M Walley.

It is charged with power and grace, yet lightened by a wry sense of humor.

There are several ways in which children\u0027s fiction has encouraged its readers to engage with and care about history: through the presence of ghosts, through frame stories, time travel, or simply setting the narrative in the past. However, modern critical theory has questioned the validity of traditional modes of the genre. This paper defends historical fiction for children by arguing that, whatever narrative strategy is used, such writing stands or falls through its evocation of a historical sensibility—or what Raymond Williams calls a `structure of feeling\u0027. This is achieved through elements of style, both in the representation of dialogue and thought. Pastiche, sometimes thought of as an unsatisfactory feature of contemporary culture, can often perform a similar evocative function. The paper is based on close readings of Alan Garner\u0027s The Stone Book from 1976, and 21st century fiction by Kevin Crossley-Holland, Kate Pennington and Paul Bajoria. If these books do not overtly use the techniques of “historiographic metafiction”, it may be because awareness of historiography is implicit in the very texture of their writing","bibo:AuthorList":["Ringrose, C."],"dc:date":"2007-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43882,"sim:weight":0.518675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.515886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383543,"sim:weight":0.512822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44084,"sim:weight":0.511979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.505754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.484952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.481941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99164,"sim:weight":0.480279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.479351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.473749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.472966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43804,"sim:weight":0.472667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.472237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43495,"sim:weight":0.468776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.458214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.451016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383589,"sim:weight":0.43882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.437781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710663,"sim:weight":0.432687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45867,"sim:weight":0.431529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This \"gap\" might be partially due to the current focus on placebo-controlled randomized trials, which are appropriately designed to answer questions about the efficacy and safety of pharmaceutical agents.\r\nIn an attempt to fit this assessment strategy, complex CAM treatment approaches have been dissected into standardized and often simplified treatment methods, and outcomes have been limited. Unlike conventional medicine, CAM has no regulatory or financial gatekeeper controlling their\r\ntherapeutic \"agents\" before they are marketed. Treatments may thus be in widespread use before researchers know of their existence. In addition, the treatments are often provided as an integrated \u0027whole system\u0027 of care, without careful consideration of the safety issue. We propose a five-phase strategy for assessing CAM built on the acknowledgement of the inherent, unique aspects of CAM treatments and their regulatory status in most Western countries. These phases comprise:\r\n1. Context, paradigms, philosophical understanding and utilization\r\n2. Safety status\r\n3. Comparative effectiveness.\r\n4. Component efficacy\r\n5. Biological mechanisms.\r\nSummary: Using the proposed strategy will generate evidence relevant to clinical practice, while\r\nacknowledging the absence of regulatory and financial gatekeepers for CAM.

Schools have been at the centre of debates about how those students who are perceived as difficult to educate may best have their needs met in classrooms, and in many countries legislation aimed to promote inclusion has focused upon changing schools in order that they may become more accessible to all students. However, such approaches, which concentrate efforts upon within school factors can be seen to have had limited success in areas of high socio-economic need. This paper, which draws upon research conducted in the UK (Rose \u0026 Jones, 2007; Rose, Smith, \u0026 Feng, 2006) suggests that a more holistic approach to inclusion, which addresses community needs and places schools at the hub of activity aimed to promote change may be beneficial.

An emerging issue on an undergraduate programme in England was how to support students who self reported educational histories of continual formative feedback, model answers, revision guides and limited use of the library. This article reports findings from an action research project which considered whether there was a mismatch between students’ previous educational histories and the academic expectations of the university. Findings indicated that academic expectations did not fully take account of previous student experiences. Student responses also indicated little previous guidance around effective internet searching and libraries were rarely used prior to starting university.

However, relatively few repositories have implemented practical action plans towards permanence. Repository managers often lack time and confidence to tackle the important but scary problem of preservation.\r\nWritten by, and aimed at, repository managers, this paper describes how the JISC-funded KeepIt project has been bringing together existing preservation tools and services with appropriate training and advice to enable repository managers to formulate practical and achievable preservation plans.\r\nThree elements of the KeepIt project are described:\r\n1. The initial, exploratory phase in which repository managers and a preservation specialist established the current status of each repository and its preservation objectives;\r\n2. The repository-specific KeepIt preservation training course which covered the organisational and financial framework of repository preservation; metadata; the new preservation tools; and issues of trust between repository, users and services;\r\n3. The application of tools and lessons learned from the training course to four exemplar repositories and the impact that this has made.\r\nThe paper concludes by recommending practical steps that all repository managers may take to ensure their repositories are preservation-ready","bibo:AuthorList":["Pickton, M.","Morris, D.","Meece, S.","Coles, S.","Hitchcock, S."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Alexogiannopoulos, S McKenney and M Pickton.

In public and academic debate, this activity is sometimes portrayed negatively as imposing excessive\r\nburdens of responsibility on the young people. This paper reports an analysis of qualitative data from a broader study of young people’s representations of conflicting roles in child development. Interview participants were monolingual and bilingual students, aged 15�18 years. Half of the latter had had personal experience of language brokering. The paper examines differences within this\r\nsample in their representations of a young person’s involvement in language brokering. Monolingual students were not generally negative in their attitudes to\r\nbilingualism and language brokering, but many showed only a vague understanding of them and perceived them as unusual or ‘strange’. Bilingual speakers,on the other hand, and in particular those with language brokering experience,\r\nsaw these activities as ‘normal’ and often showed a richer and more subtle appreciation of what was involved. These differences illustrate ways in which personal experiences influenced individuals’ representations of language brokering. Implications for an understanding of developmental scripts emphasising independence and interdependence between young people and their parents are\r\ndiscussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cline, T.","Crafter, S.","O\u0027Dell, L.","Abreu, G."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

One only needs to watch a stand up comic to appreciate that these two emotions are often closely linked.  The relationship is also becoming increasingly evident in advertising as brands compete to create a modern, entertaining and witty personality.  But when and why does an advertisement move from being funny to being offensive? This study firstly looks at the literature on both humour and offense in advertising and brings them together to establish areas of commonality. This knowledge is then used to analyse advertisements that were complained about to the ASA in 2009 which contained both humour and offense. These cases are examined to find out how offence is created and the type of humour that is creating this offence. The implications of the findings for practitioners and regulatory bodies are then discussed","bibo:AuthorList":["Mortimer, K.","Pascoe, K.","Ogilvie-Johns, G."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58210,"sim:weight":0.320494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108905,"sim:weight":0.251507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71910,"sim:weight":0.197583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929881,"sim:weight":0.172032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.156115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.152868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930219,"sim:weight":0.147629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109179,"sim:weight":0.144852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57364,"sim:weight":0.13075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929842,"sim:weight":0.116249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This method of evaluation often lacks objectivity and academic rigour and tends to focus exclusively on output. The current study reveals programme outcome benefits for NEET participants after completing a six-week ESP, delivered by a WISE. The study highlights the participant perspective and adds an objective dimension to programme evaluation through an innovative, inductive evaluation process.\r\nDesign/methodology/approach - The research adopted an intervention method, within a qualitative paradigm, employing semi-structured interviews conducted pre-and post participant engagement in the ESP. NEET participants were also asked to complete questionnaires designed to measure general self-efficacy and attitude to enterprise. The questionnaires were introduced in order to test the suitability of this type of questionnaire with NEET groups in future larger-scale studies.\r\nFindings - Analysis of the interview data revealed ten overall participant perception themes:  ‘experience’, ‘self-confidence’, ‘the programme’, ‘perceived barriers’ and ‘maturity’ at Time 1 and ‘experience’, ‘self-confidence’, ‘the programme’, ‘enterprise’ and ‘future’ at Time 2. Outcome benefits are demonstrated through differences in participant perception themes revealed at Time 1 and Time 2. Relationships between participant perception themes and questionnaire constructs are discussed in the context of future larger-scale evaluations.\r\nOriginality/value – Adopting an intervention method employing semi-structured interviews, allowed the participant’s to articulate the outcome benefits that were important for them rather than merely providing affirmation of programme provider’s expectations.\r\nKeywords – Evaluation, Validity, Enterprise Skills, Social Enterprise, NEETs\r\nPaper type Research paper","bibo:AuthorList":["Denny, S.","Hazenberg, R.","Irwin, W.","Seddon, F."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A small-scale exploratory study was conducted in several locations in the Niger\r\nDelta region, Nigeria, to discover barriers against the use of bed nets, in the context of a current drive to scale up net use in Nigeria. \r\n\r\nMethods: A qualitative approach with a convenience sample was used. One to one interviews with mostly male adult volunteers were undertaken which explored typical living and sleeping arrangements, and perceptions about and barriers against the use of the mosquito prevention\r\nbed net.\r\n\r\nResults: Several key issues emerged from the qualitative data. Bed nets were not reported as widely used in this small sample. The reasons reported for lack of use included issues of convenience, especially net set up and dismantling; potential hazard and safety concerns; issues\r\nrelated to typical family composition and nature of accommodation; humid weather conditions; and perceptions of cost and effectiveness. Most barriers to net use concerned issues about everyday practical living and sleeping arrangements and perceptions about comfort. Interviewees\r\nidentified were aware of malaria infection risks, but several also indicated certain beliefs that were barriers to net use.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Successful control of malaria and scale up of insecticide-treated net coverage relies on community perceptions and practice. This small study has illuminated a number of important everyday life issues, which remain barriers to sustained net use, and has clarified further\r\nquestions to be considered in net design and in future research studies. The study highlights the need for further research on the human concerns that contribute to sustained use of nets or, conversely, present significant barriers to their use.","bibo:AuthorList":["Galvin, K.","Petford, N.","Ajose, F.","Davies, D."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"World Health.

The sample material is the H6 chondrite\r\nKernouvé. The model utilizes the observed geometry of two distinct chondrite textures associated with\r\ngrain‐scale melt segregation in the following: (1) the undeformed (natural) state and (2) during deformation\r\nand partial melting under controlled (laboratory) conditions. The numerical simulations recover liquid\r\nmetal segregation rates of ∼10−6 to 10−4 m s−1 for matrix permeabilities (k) of 10−12 \u003c k \u003c 10−10 m2\r\nand pressure gradients of ∼1 and 104 Pa m−1. The velocity flow field is position‐dependent across the\r\nsample, reflecting initial grain‐scale heterogeneity and anisotropy in the spatial distribution of metal prior\r\nto melting. In addition to porous flow, we use a coupled Brinkman‐Navier‐Stokes solution to quantify\r\nliquid metal segregation through deformation‐induced microscale veins. Melt flow velocities in veins are\r\nseveral orders faster than matrix flow, implying that a combination of porous (grain‐scale) flow feeding\r\ninto a network of small‐scale cracks and veins during the initial stages of partial melting may be an extremely efficient mechanism for segregating liquid metal from silicate matrix in planetesimals undergoing deformation. This mechanism may be temporary and confined only to the earliest stages of melt microsegregation because with increasing temperature, the onset of silicate melting shuts off liquid metal segregation by creeping matrix flow. The point at which this occurs marks an important transition in the mode and style of internal differentiation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rushmer, T.","Petford, N."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N Bagdassarov, G Solfernio, G J Golbeck and M W Schmidt.

Schemes may involve individual institutions, consortia of institutions, national agencies, and international bodies. Such collaborations bring together students and administrators from different cultures of learning, with different expectations and definitions of their new situation; hence there are potential risks which accompany the intended benefits. There exist, however, a large number of previous and current collaborations which can provide institutions considering beginning a collaboration with object lessons: examples of best practice in similar schemes, and warnings of pitfalls to avoid. This project carried out an extensive review of existing practices and compiled seven thematic chapters and 14 case studies presenting the dilemmas and decisions of different forms of collaboration. These chapters and case studies have enabled the creation of an interactive online tool. This tool allows institutions to enter details of an intended collaboration and so generate a customised analysis based on previous experiences within the sector, and therefore better informs the design of new schemes and so reduces risks and maximises benefits for all stakeholders concerned.\r\n\r\nThis NECTAR record contains the seven thematic chapters; the case studies are available from http://nectar.northampton.ac.uk/3706","bibo:AuthorList":["Burnapp, D.","Zhao, W.","Boteju, D.","Jament, J.","Feng, Y.","Li, S.","Powis, C.","Klimes, C.","Mallam-Hassam, Y."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Burnapp and Feng Yan.

Schemes may involve individual institutions, consortia of institutions, national agencies, and international bodies. Such collaborations bring together students and administrators from different cultures of learning, with different expectations and definitions of their new situation; hence there are potential risks which accompany the intended benefits. There exist, however, a large number of previous and current collaborations which can provide institutions considering beginning a collaboration with object lessons: examples of best practice in similar schemes, and warnings of pitfalls to avoid. This project carried out an extensive review of existing practices and compiled seven thematic chapters and 14 case studies presenting the dilemmas and decisions of different forms of collaboration. These chapters and case studies have enabled the creation of an interactive online tool. This tool allows institutions to enter details of an intended collaboration and so generate a customised analysis based on previous experiences within the sector, and therefore better informs the design of new schemes and so reduces risks and maximises benefits for all stakeholders concerned.\r\n\r\nThis NECTAR record contains the 14 case studies; the thematic chapters are available from http://nectar.northampton.ac.uk/3700","bibo:AuthorList":["Burnapp, D.","Zhao, W.","Boteju, D.","Jament, J.","Feng, Y.","Li, S.","Powis, C.","Klimes, C.","Mallam-Hassam, Y."],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.591468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.534517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper aims to reconsider and reframe the relationship between retail and consumer revolutions, arguing that the two have too often been separated empirically and conceptually. \r\nDesign/methodology/approach. Reviewing a broad range of literature, the paper discusses the ways in which the historiography of retailing and consumption might be brought together by a greater focus on and theorisation of shopping. \r\nFindings. The paper highlights equivocation in the literature about the extent to which retailing was transformed during the eighteenth century in response to consumer changes. Whilst some aspects were dramatically transformed, others remained largely unchanged. It draws on a rather smaller body of work to illustrate the ways in which shopping practices were instrumental in connecting shops and consumers, linking to the cultural world of consumption to the economic realm of retailing. \r\nOriginality/value. The key argument is that, if studies of shopping are to be useful in furthering our understanding of retailing and consumption, then we must theorise shopping more fully. In particular, the paper emphasises the insights afforded by notions of performance and identity, and by analyses of consumer motivation; arguing that these offer the opportunity to link shopping to wider debates over politeness, gender roles and even modernity","bibo:AuthorList":["Stobart, J."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58751,"sim:weight":0.289374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109179,"sim:weight":0.281148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24651,"sim:weight":0.276795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108980,"sim:weight":0.250775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85409,"sim:weight":0.22248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.213888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.206167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931333,"sim:weight":0.168905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Communism is not the ‘truly human society’ that is simply waiting to be realized.

Through his books, music and artistic interventions Drummond has engaged with the (im)permanence of culture while manifesting a network of creative associations that give shape to a nebulous series of artistic efforts in a variety of media.  His latest project, The 17 and its associated book of the same name, explores the impermanence of musical expression, a theme manifested by his deletion of the KLF back catalogue in 1992 and his burning of £1 million pounds in 1994.\r\n\r\nYet the concentration on impermanence in Drummond’s musical work is balanced by the possible permanence of language, manifest both in his books and leaflets, as well as in his artworks which are highly logocentric, whether they be graffiti or the painted scores for the 17 project.  This article explores Drummond’s work through the Deleuzian filter of nomadism to interrogate the tensions between that which is now and that which has the possibility to always be.

Secondary analyses revealed significant differences for extraversion, t \u003d 2.01, p \u003d .046, neuroticism, t \u003d 3.59, p \u003d \u003c.001, and openness to experience, t \u003d 3.21, p \u003d .002, but not for fantasy-proneness, agreeableness, or conscientiousness. Findings suggest that mediumship is not associated with a reported incidence of dissociative experiences or pathology. Results are discussed in relation to previous research that has proposed the mediumship role may serve a therapeutic function","bibo:AuthorList":["Roxburgh, E.","Roe, C."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We use stories to encourage children to play and use toys to help them recreate imaginary worlds and to generate new ideas. We draw on our own cultural heritage and experience and rediscover for ourselves the worlds of fairy tales and superheroes.\r\nAs lecturers at a British University we are using this child’s world of imagination - created through drawing and play, illustration and toy making - to teach not only design but also a wide range of skills that should enable students to find new opportunities in global markets.   \r\nLive client projects with manufacturers and distributors of toys and games have benefited students, charities and the UK market. The firms and organisations involved have been drawn from the community surrounding the university, the UK and overseas. Instilling the notion of playful creativity gives students’ design work the ability to cross the boundaries that exist between generations and cultures. Using three case studies of our work with Sue Ryder (designing doll’s houses) John Crane Toys (wooden toys) and the Santander Bank (picture books and toys), we will exemplify relevant student learning by tackling key skills and issues such as ethics, quality, sustainability, cultural diversity, intellectual property, and visual literacy. \r\nThe case studies demonstrate that design students get timely exposure to resource management and the global market, considering the particular manufacturing processes and distribution networks associated with the production of books, toys and games.  We captured the learning through feedback and mapped the client interaction and situated learning with factory visits and attending trade fairs. We reviewed the collaboration with partners, drawing from expertise residing within the University. Toy design provides insights for communities of practice ranging from education and child development, knowledge and brand management, to regulators of conformity and safety standards. \r\nThe joint paper will illustrate our playful approach to designing and how the process has affected not only what we teach but also our plans for further research and collaboration.

They are expected to convey far more. We all know when we have baked the perfect cake, but more commonly we rely on others to create that something special for us, to present to our loved one. We turn to bakers, florists, jewelers, illustrators, packaging designers, the surface pattern designers, the ceramic sculptors and the firms that employ them to create a present that we can buy. The presents we give are a form of communication. They express our emotions and represent in three-dimensional form how we understand the relationship between us.\r\nThis conference provides an opportunity to look afresh at semiotics and the insights it can provide, as well as the social anthropological theories, in order to review their significance and value in the light of commercial experience. Vicki Thomas Associates is unusual as a specialist design consultancy that has created designs for the gift industries since 1984. It is made up of a team of some fifty specialists. Designers and illustrators are not trained as gift designers. Many of the products, offered to the consumer are considered kitsch by design critics but valued by the recipients, treasured and passed on to another generation.  \r\nAccording to Marcel Mauss (1925) gift exchange is a social process that occurs in all cultures and gifts in their very nature contain an obligation, to be returned or passed on. For Arnold van Gennep (1960) gift exchange is one of the rites of passage and gifts are designed today for all those occasions, when we move our geographical or social locations. Gifts are designed as souvenirs or as wedding gifts; they are given when we are born and to mark our death.  When studying the commercial gift market in the Victorian era and the mid-twentieth century Britain (Thomas, 1984), it became clear that products designed as gifts share some common attributes; they are designed to price points, they use symbols and semiotics can be used to interpret them, they are presented, they are portable, their size is relevant, whether they are useful or purely decorative must be apparent, they contain characters and personalities, they refer to a golden past, or predict a bold new future, they make us laugh and create surprise, they can be intrinsically valuable and treasured or be consumed in moment.  They are something special.\r\nLewis W. Hyde (1983) argued that creative talent is also a gift in Marcel Mauss’ terms that should be shared. We give of our time and talents. The gift exchange process generates trade and encourages commercialization.  In the last decade the MP3 player has encouraged the sharing of music, the e-book is making it is easier to share the skill of the writer and the on-line greeting card firms have added a new dimension to the role of the illustrator. How do we create something special now?  How will creative designers recompensed for the design work they do for the consumers on-line? Has the message changed and has the way it is communicated altered?","bibo:AuthorList":["Thomas, V."],"dc:date":"2011-11-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Gaining access to young children as researchers: a critical review","bibo:abstract":"Recently, research involving children has included enquiry on, about, with and by children. However, studies positioning children as co-researchers or researchers have tended to focus on children older than eight years. This paper critically reviews literature relating to aspects of an empirical study within the Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) field that conceptualises and explores research behaviours presented by children aged 4-8 years with no formal research methods training in three ECEC settings and five domestic settings in England. The enquiry - a critical ethnographic case study series located within a constructivist grounded approach was conducted according to the British Educational Research Association’s ethical guidelines (2004). Participants included children (n\u003d150), practitioners (n\u003d15), parents (n\u003d10) and professional educational researchers (n\u003d16). A rubric of professional researchers’ perceived ‘researcher behaviours’ was developed early in the study then used to evaluate children’s everyday activities. Throughout, challenges of gaining ethically appropriate access to data with young children were a significant concern. Challenges included: establishing an appropriate research instrument, gaining access to an ECEC setting, gaining acceptance from ECEC setting staff, securing informed consent from primary carers and gathering data on children’s natural behaviours at home. This paper employs critical review of literature reflecting the multi-disciplinary nature of ECEC to discuss these challenges before making recommendations for future work","bibo:AuthorList":["Murray, J."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Abbott and J Gillen.

Four leadership-related\r\nissues are explored:\r\n1. school cultures, relationships and behaviour\r\n2. partnerships and communities\r\n3. professional characteristics and behaviour\r\n4. promoting inclusion and limiting exclusion\r\nThe material surveyed confirms much of what\r\nexisting resources signal as important regarding\r\neffective leadership practice in promoting positive\r\nbehaviour. The following dimensions are evident:\r\nFour individual professional characteristics appear to\r\nbe significantly present:\r\n—— Motivation: these leaders encourage, trust and\r\nvalue colleagues to do well.\r\n—— Use of positive affirmations: these leaders are\r\novert and directed in their use of praise and\r\nencouragement.\r\n—— Modelling positive behaviour: these leaders lead\r\nby example, especially in teaching and learning.\r\n—— Recognition of personal strengths and\r\ncapabilities: these leaders are secure in selfknowledge\r\n(including recognising areas for\r\ndevelopment).\r\nFour institutional leadership characteristics appear to\r\nbe significantly present:\r\n—— Distribution of leadership: the leaders offer\r\nregular opportunities for all colleagues to\r\nundertake greater responsibility and to help build\r\nleadership teams.\r\n—— Promotion of professional learning: the\r\nleaders encourage all colleagues to engage in\r\nprofessionally focused learning, from the point at\r\nwhich they join the school.\r\n—— Encouraging calculated risk-taking: these leaders\r\nallow members of the school community at\r\nlarge to use their initiative in the context of\r\ninstitutional support.\r\n—— Redefining pupil behaviour: these leaders\r\nencourage approaches that connect behaviour\r\nand learning.\r\nEach of these characteristics is relevant to leaders\r\nacross Key Stage 1 (KS) to KS4 settings, and\r\ncontribute to the task of enabling schools and other\r\nsettings to meet the needs of diverse populations of\r\nlearners, including pupils who present considerable\r\nbehavioural challenges.

The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) and Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2008) are pivotal pieces that influence this commitment for appropriate provision for students with SEN and Disability. Add to this Australia’s status as a signatory on the Salamanca Agreement (1994) and this demonstrates a commitment to inclusive educational practices by government.\r\nThe call for an inclusive curriculum is universal in Australia.

At international level, initiatives such as the Salamanca Statement (UNESCO 1994), the Dakar Framework for Action (2000), and the Millennium Development Goals (United Nations 2000) have highlighted the shortcomings of previous generations of administrators and policy makers in providing adequate educational opportunities for learners who have been marginalised as a result of disability, poverty, gender or political upheaval. These laudable documents have encouraged national governments to initiate policies in an attempt to redress the balance and challenge the inequalities that have been pervasive in many education systems. The translation of policy into practice has however, often proven to be difficult and slow to take place. This paper considers the difficulties of addressing inclusion through a top down, policy led model and will discuss why such an approach may be experiencing difficulties in respect of implementation and impact. It is suggested that in order for inclusive education to succeed it is necessary to enfranchise local communities by building upon current local experiences and expertise which through implementing change at a local level may influence a broader national and international picture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rose, R."],"dc:date":"2012-02-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.265627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.245299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734403,"sim:weight":0.241653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.224165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The latter deals with mobilising support, services and resources. The post-disaster management requires overall quick response from police, paramedics and anti-terrorist squad as well as specialist disaster recovery teams, available onsite and offsite, and are classified as first responders and control centre respectively in this abstract.\r\nThe model proposed in the research addresses preparedness, response and recovery stages of disaster management. The four major entities – people in the disaster area, hereby called victims, specialist application on mobile phones, hereby called, iSurvive,  onsite specialist disaster management team, the first responders and offsite specialist team, the control centre,  communicate using ubiquitous wireless and mobile communication technologies to address various stages in disaster management. \r\nAs part of preparedness phase of pre-disaster management, people subscribing to iSurvive application would have their profiles available on a web-based system, accessible at control centre. The mobile application, iSurvive, initiated by victims, would kick- start a communication process using wireless and mobile communication technologies from  GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth and GSM, that would help to set up ad-hoc networks using functioning mobile phones within disaster area.  These networks, which are self-configurable, would facilitate two-way communication within the disaster area and with control centre and first responders, using instructions, messages, images and videos. The control centre would also provide services, such as data validation, monitoring and logging of communication using iSurvive application to guide first responders and victims. During the recovery phase, after the connection between victims and first responders are established, data from within disaster area is gathered by first responders to pass on control centre for analysis and validation, guidance and instructions. The control centre would use the information received from disaster area to track victims’ profile, already available on web-based system, for purposes such as contacting next of kin etc.\r\nAs effective disaster response demands rapid access to reliable and accurate data and capacity to access, analyse and integrate information from varied sources, the security breach and misuse of communication in such networks pose a potential challenge and cannot be undermined. The reliability in communication process would be incorporated using data validation and authentication.  As panic under disaster and emergency situations adversely affects normal human responses, other major challenge for mobile application design would be to make it user-friendly to guide victims under panic through series of guided steps. Other systemic challenges to address would include battery life and signal strength of these devices.\r\nAs versatile mobile disaster management application is far from reality. While the proposed application would serve disaster situations, such as, earthquakes, floods; additional extensions for security of communications in the proposed system would be necessary to deal with disaster situations involving terrorist attacks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Sherbaz, A.","Dravid, R.","Svensson, J."],"dc:date":"2012-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1549727,"sim:weight":0.236241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.205818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.181531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.166269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70126,"sim:weight":0.164981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1549873,"sim:weight":0.160045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1549890,"sim:weight":0.156291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70404,"sim:weight":0.143077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1549874,"sim:weight":0.136838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70175,"sim:weight":0.110779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Increasing awareness of cybersecurity and emphasising the need for a common vision among students addresses the challenges. The proposed pedagogic model is to embed the computer forensics materials within the undergraduate modules to extend students’ knowledge and skills in a practical context. However, it is also recognised that the depth of knowledge required learning such topics as cyber security should be offered from the underlying principles to their abstraction.\r\nCyber crimes are on the rise however, Cyber security professionals are in a depressingly low numbers. The lack of focus on this area has certainly resulted in a limited number of experts. Today, there is a demanding need to create new cyber security jobs, which should hopefully bring leverage to the uncontrollable rise of cyber crimes. It is, therefore, necessary to develop the analytical skills which create challenges in building a constructive approach to learning. Also, reflecting the technological fluctuations, it is seen as essential for students to be continuously updated.\r\nThe proposed model focuses on the delivery and assessment of certain computing modules, with an evaluation of its efficiency on the use of time and effort in order to satisfy the minimum requirements of the curriculum. The study has also discovered that some of the modules already cover part of computer forensics implicitly. Therefore, highlighting these topics to the students and making them more visible as computer forensics is one of the main objectives. Another objective is to enhance the existing computing modules by dedicating certain amount of lecture time on computer forensic related concepts. The model can then be adopted by Universities when considering developing new modules.\r\nOver the last few years there have been large increases in cyber-crimes which have threatened individuals and organisations. To reduce the threat it is imperative that the computing courses within universities increase the level of student awareness by providing them with professional education in computer forensics and cyber-security without the need to create a separate specialised pathway.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Sherbaz, A.","Minai, A.","Dravid, R.","Xue, J."],"dc:date":"2011-11-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Widespread concern is being expressed across Europe regarding a perceived increase in cases of unacceptable or anti-social behaviour in schools and its impact on levels of academic achievement. The issue has mainly been interrogated via research and development which has sought to enhance provision at initial teacher level. Yet international studies on ‘school discipline’ indicate that it is the school leader who is the key actor in promoting positive attitudes to learning and behaviour. This paper explores the views of a small group of school leaders, in order to identify specific professional and personal characteristics which appear to be required to promote such conditions.

In the external examiner report (Hebditch, 2005) for Fine Art, it was noted that the students were having problems with referencing, and a project was set up to investigate and address the issue. I created an e-tutorial and carried out face to face workshops plus created a comprehensive referencing guide to help support the new referencing system, but the outcomes of the project potentially have wider repercussions for referencing.\r\n\r\nThe referencing system put in place for the Fine Art cohort is a numerical system based upon Kate Turabian’s manual (1996). As part of the research for the project I spoke to many students regarding difficulties with referencing. Most comments related to difficulties in reading comprehension caused by the parentheses used for in-text citations for systems such as Harvard or MLA. Whilst the project focused on the logistics of teaching a new referencing system to large groups of students, further research is required into reading comprehension and referencing systems, particularly for students with extra difficulties such as dyslexia.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this short paper is to share my findings and to open the topic up to discussion before undertaking further research in the areas of reading comprehension and dyslexia related specifically to referencing. There has been very little research undertaken in this area and I would value the input and experiences of other information professionals before carrying out a large scale research project.

This paper examines the response of the academy and one specific university in the UK over a ten year period to this charge. \r\n\r\nThe main factors prompting universities to address race equality have been external to the sector. The government cajoled universities to address race equality through two strategies for higher education, notably those concerned with widening participation and human resources; and the state required universities to develop race equality policies and action plans following new race relations legislation.\r\n\r\nGovernment strategies for higher education did initiate some changes but had little impact either on the sector’s or the case study university’s approach to race equality. By contrast, the legislation did have an impact, with many universities developing for the first time specific race equality policies and action plans. Resistance, however, to an agenda concerned with race equality has grown within the sector and the university, as external pressures to promote equality and celebrate diversity have subsided and other agendas concerned with community cohesion have taken primacy.\r\n\r\nThroughout the period under discussion there was a reluctance to identify race equality as a priority and to take corresponding action because of what has been called ‘the sheer weight of whiteness’ (Back, 2004: 1). A comparison of Midshire University with Midshire Police reinforced this perception.  While it identified contrasts in the occupational cultures of the two organisations, at the same time it pointed to surprising parallels in their approaches to race equality which stemmed from a taken for granted white norm","bibo:AuthorList":["Pilkington, A."],"dc:date":"2012-04-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

More specifically, through a detailed analysis of two of her collections, The Zoo Father (2001) and The Wounded Deer (2005), I examine the ways in which Petit attempts to extricate confessional poetry from the stereotype of self-indulgent, ‘awful’ femininity outlined by Deryn Rees-Jones in Consorting with Angels (2005). It is my view that by recapitulating stories of women and violence in a variety of new contexts, Petit is able to reconfigure the politics of sexual violence, radically re- conceptualizing the traditional meaning of victimhood, the relationship between victims and perpetrators, and the stubbornly gendered notions of activity and passivity. This, I argue, is demonstrated most explicitly in the mythological poems of The Zoo Father, and in Petit’s poems about Frida Kahlo in The Wounded Deer. Locating the poetry of Petit alongside the painting of Frida Kahlo, I analyze the extent to which these artists are identified as ‘confessional’, and interrogate the validity, as well as the usefulness, of this problematic (and gendered) descriptor","bibo:AuthorList":["Brigley, Z."],"dc:date":"2008-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2734362,"sim:weight":0.213435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.18977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108988,"sim:weight":0.18371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.181615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.165412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.161957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108987,"sim:weight":0.160457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929930,"sim:weight":0.126609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The outcome of this process of absorption could be perceived as the British relativist style, situating the European performer between the dominant influence of American 20th century theatre dance and Asian dance traditions. In this paper we aim to break down choreography as a methodological process, proposing that there cloud be a clearer distinction between choreographic methods and compositional practices to allow for discussion of particular stages of the artistic development process in creating a choreographic work. At the core of this dialogue are the compositional and teaching experiences of an American trained British dance practitioner in different parts of South East Asia. The encounter with what could be referred to as the cultural ‘Other’ allows us to trace the use of the body and mind (conscious and unconscious) in the development of compositional practices. The paper negotiates between compositional and choreographic methods and the theories of Françoise Lyotard and Henri Bergson to allow for an integration of the processes of creation within the interpretation of choreography","bibo:AuthorList":["Braeuninger, R.","Seago, C.","Stock, C."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":8793386,"ep:Repository":78,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"An evidence-based classification framework for Hallux Rigidus","bibo:abstract":"Hallux rigidus (HR) is the second most common pathology affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint and a primary cause of morbidity and disability. Classification of this condition helps to inform management. Over the years a number of formal HR classification systems have been devised but despite this collective experience there is no consensus on classification design, construction, application or parameters’ validity. The aim of this research was to develop an evidence-based classification framework for HR and establish its validation and reproducibility. This was achieved through four studies.\r\n\r\nAn initial study of 110 patients was used to determine the clinical parameters of HR. In addition to other pertinent findings this showed a positive relationship between second toe length and first metatarsophalangeal joint pain (P\u003c0.001). Correlations were found between first metatarsophalangeal joint pain and pes planus (r\u003d0.84, P\u003d0.05) and between reduced first metatarsophalangeal joint range of motion and hallux abductus interphalangeus (r\u003d0.92, P\u003d0.05). \r\n\r\nA second study examined the radiological parameters of HR (in the same population). Amongst other relevant findings comparison of joint space narrowing with either hallux abductus interphalangeus (P\u003c0.005) or osteophyte severity (P\u003c0.002) was established. \r\n\r\nIntra and inter-rater reliability studies were undertaken for all parameters. Overall, inter-rater reliability was poor. Only 28% of angular inter-rater measurements fell within a 5° range. \r\n\r\nA fourth study was used to determine ‘expert’ opinion on HR classification using semi-structured interviews. The results revealed the need for consensus agreement among clinicians and patient involvement in creation and substantiation of classification content.\r\n\r\nThis research has provided a new understanding of HR classification and informed the development of a HR classification framework based on history, clinical and radiological domains. The established framework provides more than just a measure of severity and includes other dimensions such as contributory factors and functionality. Depending on its context, other applications include use as a diagnostic tool, establishing HR prevalence, monitoring progress, and surgical decision making. An algorithmic approach can enable the classification framework to be applied in different contexts proving clinical relevance and meaning to a range of professions. \r\n\r\nThis research also highlights that classification parameters should be validated, reliable, sensitive, quantifiable and few in numbers and that there is a requirement to provide a ‘gold standard’ against which future HR research can be compared.","bibo:AuthorList":["Beeson, P."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2005).

Literature in this area focuses largely on ‘choices’ and ‘barriers to breastfeeding’. It is our argument, however, that women’s cultural context plays a key role in infant feeding ‘choices’. In this paper, we explore contested representations of infant feeding and infant feeding choices in public debates conducted on a large British parenting website.  We identify dominant constructions of women who breastfeed or bottle feed, social representations of both forms of infant feeding,  and explore the relationship between constructions of infant feeding choices and constructions of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ motherhood.  To sample dominant representations of infant feeding circulating in UK culture, two threads were chosen from the debating board of a busy online parenting community (105 and 99 individual posts respectively). Participants on the threads were largely women. A feminist informed Foucauldian discourse analysis was used to deconstruct the intersecting constructions of gender, childhood and motherhood implicit in public discussions about infant feeding choices. This analysis functions to trouble the individualist assumptions underpinning the notion of infant feeding ‘choices’, considering the cultural context within which British mothers ‘choose’ how to feed their babies","bibo:AuthorList":["Callaghan, J.","Lazard, L."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Recent work to ascertain the level of ‘eco-retrofit’ related activity that could be under way in the region has only been able to identify one-off ‘pilot projects’ to demonstrate the impact of changes to a few stock units, and there at present seem to be no medium to long-term plans for stock-holders in the public sector to prepare for an on-going engagement with energy and other utility efficiency programmes, and no equivalent ‘pilots’ in the private sector","bibo:AuthorList":["Field, M."],"dc:date":"2010-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84852,"sim:weight":0.294809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There are clear expectations that reading lists exist in H.E., but beyond that, what is the value of reading lists and how are they REALLY being used? This practitioner research was designed to explore the reality of reading list use with academic staff and Foundation Degree (FD) students in Health and Education.\r\n\r\nAs Academic Librarians we became aware that FD students have difficulty using the course reading lists. Students either read everything or nothing and they find it difficult to distinguish which texts are most appropriate for their level and skills. This can lead to feelings of uncertainty and frustration (Martin and Stokes, 2006), which we suspected might have an impact on the students’ learning and their use of information resources. It was apparent that the existing reading lists were not meeting all of the students’ needs.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 we were awarded the Library and Information Research Group (LIRG) Research Award to fund our research into reading lists. This project involved working with tutors to develop enhanced reading lists to actively scaffold students’ information skills development. We conducted focus groups with students and interviews with academic staff to explore their expectations and experiences of reading lists. This short paper will report our findings so far and focus on the impact of reading lists on the student experience.\r\n\r\nWe will generate discussion around the relevance and value of reading lists for information skills development, including views on the use and expectation of reading lists and on how we can promote more active engagement with reading lists by all stakeholders in the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rose, H.","Siddall, G."],"dc:date":"2012-04-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.345266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60331,"sim:weight":0.314102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.305953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9631121,"sim:weight":0.302667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341327,"sim:weight":0.260941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23253,"sim:weight":0.215727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Librarians and Course Leader were concerned about low Internal Student Survey (ISS) feedback from students and therefore sought ways to improve practice and enhance student learning. Findings of an initial student questionnaire in September 2009 revealed a mismatch between staff expectations and the reality of the students’ educational histories. For example, a much lower than expected use of libraries prior to starting university, limited previous guidance on how to search the Internet, continual formative support with assessments, model answers and revision guides. Subsequently, library support moved from a traditional model of a library induction followed by a one-hour practical information skills sessions in year one, to a scaffolding approach. This involved short drop-in sessions at key points in the course to introduce new concepts, or to refresh knowledge prior to assignment setting and to maintain the librarians’ profile with the students. Assignment specific support sheets were created, which used a tapered approach designed to scaffold the students’ developing information skills as they progressed through the year. A focus group was conducted at the end of the first term to track progress, as well as an end of year questionnaire. Transitional scaffolding was positively evaluated, students reported greater confidence levels in accessing appropriate resources, the course had a raised grade profile, and higher ISS scores compared to previous years, and higher levels of student retention. The practical outcomes are now being applied to other courses across the School of Education at the University, with plans to transfer to other subjects in 2011-12.","bibo:AuthorList":["McBryde-Wilding, H.","Rose, H."],"dc:date":"2011-06-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Lumsden, H McBryde-Wilding and H Rose.

One of the emerging issues on an early years undergraduate programme is how to support the students effectively with the assessment requirements. Concerns stemmed from students self reporting that their previous experience of education involved continual formative feedback prior to final submission of their work, provision of revision guides and limited use of the library.\r\n\r\nThis paper reports on the evaluation of a collaborative project between the School of Education and the Department of Information Services at an English university with a specific focus on the dialogues that have taken place between lecturers, students and support staff.  The small scale project aims to address the transitional challenges experienced by a diverse cohort of undergraduate students as they engage with the assessment requirements of their university career.\r\n\r\nQuestionnaires and focus groups are being used to develop understanding of the diverse student needs at the start of their university career, at the end of their first module and their first year. Whilst this evaluative research is still being conducted, early findings clearly indicate that the student experience concurs with previous student cohorts self reported experience of assessment support prior to attending university. Initial findings indicate educational histories where continual support with writing assignments and completing coursework, prior to the final deadline, was normal practice.  There was limited guidance on searching the internet and the library was rarely used.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lumsden, E.","McBryde-Wilding, H.","Rose, H."],"dc:date":"2010-05-13","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M J Bent.
