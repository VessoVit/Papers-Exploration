One of the options available in a suite of techniques is managed realignment. Managed realignment works by allowing salt water back onto land originally reclaimed by the construction of a seawall, with consequential or deliberate creation of new inter-tidal habitat.\r\n\r\nThe Blackwater Estuary in Essex, UK has been a focal point for 4 managed realignments over the past decade, one being a Marina the others habitat creation. Until recently, habitat design considerations in such managed realignment treatments have been directed largely at bird life and saltmarsh generation. The Abbotts hall site in particular has demonstrated very rapid saltmarsh development and consequently has improved the public opinion of such schemes. However, our recent studies have shown that sites such as these also have far reaching benefits for fisheries, water quality, recreation and possible health benefits. The quiescent waters of these sites provide nursery habitat for fish such as sea bass and herring whilst acting as a site for carbon sequestration and recreational pursuits all in one site. \r\n\r\nThe UK expertise in sampling and studying these sites now features in an Interreg IIIb project, Comcoast. ComCoast‚Äôs explicit aim is to explore ‚ÄúCOMbined functions in COASTal defence zones‚Äø. The ComCoast project has five partner countries the Netherlands, the UK, Germany, Belgium and Denmark. The UK leads on the socio-economic benefits of these schemes and has three PhD‚Äôs (socio-economics, fisheries utilisation and carbon sequestration) looking into these benefits. The PhD‚Äôs are now two years into their research looking into the multi-functional benefits of these flood risk management schemes. The PhD‚Äôs work is linked by integrating their research into saltmarsh and managed realignment productivity values for the food web as a whole, from sediment to fish. The socio-economic benefits of these functions and the benefits to the local community will also be valued and reported in December 2007. Site design and sampling considerations will be described. \r\n\r\nComCoast in the UK is also exploring potential ventures for farm business diversification of managed realignments and regulated tidal exchange sites. This work will look at the options open to landowners of running a sustainable commercially viable business within intertidal sites. \r\n\r\nThe ComCoast project is working on how we can improve partnerships toward managing our coasts. With a partnership approach it has been recognised funding, resource and common goals can be shared and reached by working together.","bibo:AuthorList":["Astley-Reid, Trazar"],"dc:date":"2006-11-08","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G J Akkerman, J Van Der Meer, J Koenis and P Bernardini.

The Green Paper will be a success if it forges a consensus among stakeholders ‚Äì the Member States and citizens ‚Äì that the EU needs to look at the oceans and seas in an integrated manner, if Europe is to maintain its resource base and to continue being competitive in maritime affairs. The Commission hopes that this Green Paper will launch a broad public debate both on the principle of the EU adopting an overall approach to maritime policy and on the many ideas for action.

Fluvial protection and coast protection are\r\nseparate issues each with their own problems and drivers. There should be a clear division\r\nof approach and funding.

{"identifier":9518,"ep:Repository":20,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Eutrophication in Europe‚Äôs coastal waters","bibo:abstract":"The major impacts of eutrophication due to overloading with nitrogen and\r\nphosphorus nutrients are changes in the structure and functioning of marine\r\necosystems, reduced biodiversity, and reduced income from fishery, mariculture\r\nand tourism.\r\nThe main objective of this report is to evaluate the causes, state and development\r\nof eutrophication in European coastal waters, and to identify areas where more\r\nmonitoring data are needed to improve assessment. In addition, a first evaluation\r\nis made of the use of a trophical index for water quality assessment and the use of\r\nremote sensing as a eutrophication monitoring tool in northern seas.\r\nData and information from the marine conventions (AMAP, Helcom, OSPAR,\r\nUNEP/MAP, Medpol) and EEA national reference centres have been used, as well\r\nas information in grey and scientific literature. However, the data available for the\r\nproject were scarce and, with the exception of some regions, inadequate for fully\r\nassessing the state and trends of eutrophication at a European level. In particular,\r\neutrophication data were missing from the Bay of Biscay, the Iberian coast and the\r\nMediterranean Sea.\r\nDriving forces\r\nThe main source of nitrogen is run-off from agricultural land brought to the sea\r\nvia rivers. Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen may also contribute significantly to\r\nthe nitrogen load. This nitrogen originates partly from ammonia evaporation from\r\nanimal husbandry and partly from combustion of fossil fuels in traffic, industry\r\nand households. Most of the phosphorus comes from households and industry\r\ndischarging treated or untreated wastewater to freshwater or directly to the sea,\r\nand from soil erosion. Locally, fish farming may also cause eutrophication\r\nproblems.\r\nPressures\r\nThe main increase in nutrient load took place before monitoring programmes and\r\npollution load compilations were started. According to information in the\r\nliterature, a conservative estimate of the increase in nitrogen loads from land and\r\natmosphere to the Baltic and North Sea regions is a doubling from the 1950s to\r\nthe 1980s, and a fourfold increase in the phosphorus load from the 1940s to the\r\n1970s. The development in load to the Mediterranean Sea is unknown, but\r\nprobably of the same magnitude.\r\nSince the middle of the 1980s the phosphorus load has generally been reduced, in\r\nsome Helcom and OSPAR areas up to 50 %, due to improved sewage treatment and\r\nphosphate-free detergents. The nitrogen load from point sources has also been\r\nreduced, but there is no discernible reduction from agriculture as the main diffuse\r\nnitrogen source to the North Sea. However, the nitrogen load to the Baltic Sea is\r\nassumed to have decreased slightly due to the reduction in the fertiliser usage in\r\nthe countries in transition in this area.\r\nAtmospheric nitrogen deposition to the Baltic Sea area decreased about 25 %\r\nfrom 1986 to 1995, although this was somewhat less in the transition area, mainly\r\ndue to reduced production in eastern Europe. No changes have been seen in the\r\nwet deposition of nitrogen to the North Sea.\r\nState and impact\r\nThe present state of eutrophication is assessed in terms of winter nutrient\r\nconcentrations, chlorophyll-a and bottom oxygen concentrations. Nutrient\r\nconcentrations gave the best spatial resolution in the assessment of eutrophication.\r\nAnalysis of the relationship between nutrients and salinity showed a consistent\r\npattern of eutrophic conditions in areas receiving freshwater input from urban and\r\nagricultural catchments. Freshwater from areas less impacted by human activity\r\nhad in general no effect on the eutrophy of the seas. Chlorophyll-a concentrations\r\nshowed a weak positive correlation to winter concentrations of nitrogen. Oxygen\r\nconcentrations in the bottom water were not correlated with any of the other\r\nvariables and the geographical pattern in hypoxia/anoxia could only be explained\r\nby the vertical stratification of the water column.\r\nIn agreement with the development in nutrient load, nitrogen and phosphorus\r\nconcentrations in the Baltic Sea area and the German Bight generally doubled\r\nfrom the late 1960s to the middle of the 1980s. Phytoplankton production and\r\nfrequency of algal blooms increased, and consequently the silicate concentrations\r\ndecreased, as did also the transparency and, in stratified areas, the bottom oxygen\r\nconcentrations. Since the middle of the 1980s phosphorus concentrations have\r\ndecreased in many estuaries and coastal areas. However, nitrogen concentrations\r\nhave remained constant or slightly decreased due to variations in run-off. General\r\nimprovements in biological eutrophication variables are absent or local.\r\nIn Arctic waters with very sparsely populated drainage areas, eutrophication from\r\nfish farming in sill fiords is the major threat. However, as location of aquacultural\r\nplants is regulated, eutrophication is not an issue of concern in European Arctic\r\nwaters.\r\nThe whole coastal as well as open Baltic Sea is affected by eutrophication with\r\nenhanced nutrient concentrations and related problems. The anthropogenic\r\nnutrient load is at its lowest in the northern forested and sparsely populated Gulf\r\nof Bothnia region. The highest load can be found in estuaries and coastal areas\r\nclose to rivers that drain agricultural and densely populated areas.\r\nIn the Greater North Sea eutrophication primarily affects the coastal zone. In\r\nparticular, in estuaries and fiords, Wadden Sea, German Bight, Kattegat and\r\neastern Skagerrak, nutrient related problems are widespread.\r\nIn the Celtic Seas eutrophication is restricted to the Bristol Channel, Irish Sea and\r\nmany estuaries, especially the Mersey estuary, Liverpool Bay, Belfast Lough, Cork\r\nHarbour, Dublin Bay and associated estuaries.\r\nIn the Bay of Biscay and at the Iberian coast eutrophication problems are\r\nrestricted to estuaries and coastal lagoons, especially Bay of Vilaine, Arcachon, Ria\r\nFormosa and Huelva.\r\nIn the Mediterranean Sea eutrophication appears to be limited mainly to specific\r\ncoastal and adjacent offshore areas. Several and sometimes severe cases of\r\neutrophication are evident, especially in enclosed coastal bays which receive\r\nelevated nutrient loads from rivers, together with direct discharges of untreated or\r\npoorly treated domestic and industrial wastewater. In the Mediterranean Sea,\r\nespecially the Adriatic, Gulf of Lion and northern Aegean Sea are areas with\r\nenhanced nutrient concentrations and related problems. Discharge of untreated or\r\npoorly treated wastewater is a major eutrophication problem in the Mediterranean\r\nSea, in addition to nutrient loads from agriculture and aquaculture.\r\nResponses\r\nThe Baltic Sea countries have decided on a 50 % reduction in the nutrient load,\r\nwhile the North Sea countries have decided on a 50 % reduction in the nutrient\r\nload to areas affected by or likely to be affected by eutrophication. OSPAR\r\ncountries have designated areas to which a comprehensive procedure should be\r\napplied in order to classify the maritime area in terms of problem areas, potential\r\nproblem areas and non-problem areas with regard to eutrophication. In addition\r\nthe EU urban wastewater treatment directive, nitrate directive and water\r\nframework directive will reduce eutrophication in European waters, and\r\neutrophication sensitive areas are identified by the Member States.\r\nTrophic index and remote sensing\r\nThe trophic index and remote sensing of chlorophyll-a concentrations tested in\r\nthis study have the potential to be developed further into practicable methods for\r\nmonitoring and assessing the trophic state and trends of European marine and\r\ncoastal waters.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2001-10-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C T Agger and G √Ürtebjerg.

Chlorophyll-a maps were\r\ncontrolled against in situ data from the\r\nSkagerrak, Kattegat and the North Sea for\r\nthe period September 1997 to the end of\r\n1999. Based on in situ data the\r\nchlorophyll-a maps were tuned to reflect\r\n‚Äôtrue surface concentrations‚Äô of\r\n‚Äôchlorophyll-a-like-pigments‚Äô. The\r\ninformation and concentrations in the\r\nmaps were locally compared with in situ\r\ndata and a priori general knowledge of the\r\narea.\r\nThe algorithms to produce the\r\n‚Äôchlorophyll-a-like-pigments‚Äô from the\r\nwater using radiance from SeaWIFS\r\nobservations are presently overestimating\r\nthe ‚Äôtrue‚Äô concentration. In the open sea\r\nof the tested areas the overestimation is in\r\nthe order of 60-70 %. It was not the\r\nobjective of this study to investigate the\r\nscientific rationale behind these findings.\r\nThe information in terms of necessary in\r\nsitu data such as the different optical\r\nquantities of suspended and dissolved\r\norganic material as well as atmospheric\r\ndata to do such a study was either not\r\navailable or limited as this kind of data is\r\nnot collected in ordinary monitoring\r\nprogrammes. We have therefore tuned the\r\nsatellite images to in situ concentrations\r\nfrom empirical statistical analysis only.\r\nThe most severe problems retrieving a\r\ncorrect chlorophyll-a concentration from\r\nsatellite images was in the near coastal\r\nareas, and the problems with\r\noverestimation of chlorophyll-a were\r\nincreasing when approaching less saline\r\nwater as at the Norwegian coast. The water\r\nmasses in this area have normally high\r\nconcentrations of dissolved organic\r\nmaterial that influences the retrieval\r\nalgorithms for chlorophyll-a. But knowing\r\nthe limitation of the data both before and\r\nafter rescaling to in situ concentrations the\r\nsatellite data gives important information\r\non the environment.\r\nThe satellite data gives good information\r\nnot only on the relative phytoplankton\r\ndistribution, but also the concentrations\r\nwhen tuning the SeaWIFS-data to the\r\nsurface concentrations using in situ data\r\nfrom the area. Using monthly mean maps\r\nin the period May to August gives much\r\ninformation on the phytoplankton\r\nbiomass in the period when the\r\nproduction most often is nutrient limited.\r\nThe mean or median value in this period\r\nwould be the best and most appropriate\r\nexpression for the level of eutrophication.\r\nVery limited satellite data was available\r\nfrom the winter period November to\r\nFebruary in this area. If the goal is to use\r\nthe satellite data to map eutrophication\r\nthis is not critical, since this is a period\r\nwhen the phytoplankton is light-limited,\r\nand is therefore not related to the\r\nnutrient input. The chlorophyll-a maps\r\nfrom the period March to April/May reflect realistically the magnitude and geographical distribution\r\nof the spring bloom, and therefore also\r\nthe level of eutrophication. Since the\r\nspring bloom could reflect the magnitude\r\nof the available winter nutrient pool, a\r\nchlorophyll-a map showing the maximum\r\nconcentration in each pixel should be\r\nuseful for studying the eutrophication\r\nlevel.\r\nIn general, the satellite data and\r\ninformation that has been investigated in\r\nthis study gives promising possibilities to\r\nimprove monitoring by a combination of\r\nin situ data and satellite data. New satellite\r\nsensors with improved spatial and spectral\r\nresolution, and new insight in solving the\r\nproblems with the algorithms will improve\r\nthe accuracy of the satellite data products.\r\nFrom a eutrophication monitoring point\r\nof view the number of stations may be\r\nreduced in the open sea areas when the\r\nquality of the satellite data are controlled\r\non other stations with in situ data.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2002-12-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Aas and N K H√∏jerslev.

Source apportionment results from the following sources have been used:\r\n‚Ä¢ international organisations such as transboundary river commissions and regional marine conventions;\r\n‚Ä¢ national and regional studies;\r\n‚Ä¢ research activities.\r\nThe north-western part of Europe is generally well covered by source apportionment studies, but there is a shortage of information from the Mediterranean countries and some eastern European countries.\r\nThis study is the first step in a wider framework action dealing with the assessment of nutrient inputs from agriculture and other sources into water bodies of inland waters as well as transitional, coastal and marine waters and is seen in the context of ongoing EEA work on agriculture and environment.\r\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of current policies and agreements and to identify gaps, it is essential to know how nutrient inputs are distributed across sectors. Results from source apportionment studies are therefore important in the policy formulation process and in monitoring the implementation of policies and the effectiveness of measures.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2005-12-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"degisudiensteHeratanpbilanz Whitehead, P G, E J Wilson and D Butterfield.

{"identifier":14695,"ep:Repository":20,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The rivers of the Black Sea","bibo:abstract":"The Black Sea is now one of the most studied of all the marine basins on our planet. This\r\nhas engendered a requirement for more precise data from additional research such as the\r\nbalance between water and river load, sediment formation and a wide range of other subjects.\r\nThe situation has been made more complex in recent years by the ever-increasing level\r\nof pollution, with its links to the outflow of water and river load from the surrounding\r\nlandmass.\r\nInterest in the Black Sea stems not just from its strategic position and the biological richness\r\nof its waters. It is also of great economic significance internationally. The economic role of\r\nthe Black Sea has increased over recent years since, after the disintegration of the Soviet\r\nUnion, six Black Sea littoral countries (Bulgaria, Georgia, Russia, Rumania, Turkey,\r\nUkraine) reasserted their interest in these waters. Of prime importance to the Black Sea\r\neconomy is the transportation of cargo, locally and as part of the ancient Silk Route, and the\r\nproduction and transportation of oil. The need to transport oil has driven the recent expansion\r\nof the existing ports and there are plans for new ports to be built.\r\nThere are many industrial and military sites located around the Black Sea. Moreover, the\r\nBlack Sea was, in the recent past, an important resort and holiday destination - a fact which\r\nmust not be lost sight of. While this role diminished throughout the 1990s, the Black Sea\r\nresorts and recreational areas have once again begun to attract tourists.\r\nThe international Black Sea Economic Cooperation Area (BSEC), comprising the six littoral\r\nStates and Azerbaijan, Albania, Armenia, Greece and Moldova, was set up in 1992 to exert\r\nsome control over these complex economic issues.\r\nAll these circumstances give support to the conclusion that a new approach to Black Sea\r\nissues is necessary, one which will entail meticulous study of the sea‚Äôs biology, all the more\r\nurgent now as human life has more and more negative impact on the already poor ecological\r\ncondition of the sea.\r\nThis new raft of work will attempt to quantify the amount of river discharge ‚Äî water and load\r\n‚Äî disgorging into the Black Sea. Much is expected from a study at this level. The aggregate\r\namount of fresh water entering the sea is still known only approximately; precise information\r\nis long overdue. New data from hydrometric observations and research over recent\r\nyears has enabled more precise figures to be calculated for the amount of river water entering\r\nthe Black Sea; these calculations have included the effect of artificial control of the flow.\r\nRiver load is the factor least studied, in the Black Sea as in other regions. There are other\r\nassociated issues here, too, such as erosion of riverbanks, artificial beach formation, pollution of the sea etc. These issues are particularly topical now, when shoreline retreat, caused by\r\na decreasing amount of bank-forming deposits, has become irreversible, and are played out\r\nagainst a background of observable increase in the ocean levels worldwide, with pollution in\r\nthe Black Sea already reaching threatening level. Accurate quantitative assessments of river\r\nload reaching the sea are also necessary for any proper research into current sediment formation\r\nprocesses on the sea bottom.\r\nIt must also be remembered that the virtually locked water basin of the Black Sea is many\r\nways similar to an ocean, especially in the relation between river load distribution and\r\ndeposition. Given its more favourable conditions and the less extensive scope of work involved,\r\nthe Black Sea can be regarded as a natural laboratory (110).\r\nIn recent years, with ‚Äònew times‚Äô entering the political situation, the spirit of new times has\r\nentered the Black Sea research arena, too, and investigations have become international in\r\ncharacter. A Black Sea Regional Committee (BSRC) was set up in 1996 under Unesco‚Äôs\r\nIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, tasked with coordinating and intensifying\r\nscientific research on the Black Sea. One of its key projects (pilot project 2: Black Sea\r\nsediment fluxes) conducts research into flows of river load into the sea, and our document is\r\npart of this project.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jaoshvili, S"],"dc:date":"2002-06-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"–í –í –ì–æ—Ä–¥–µ–µ–≤.

Additionally, a Transboundary\r\nDiagnostic Analysis (TDA) (UNEP/MAP, 2004a),\r\nbased on the UNEP/MAP MEDPOL programme, has\r\nhighlighted endangered marine and coastal areas\r\nfrom land-based activities (i.e. pollution arising\r\nfrom urbanisation, population growth, tourism,\r\nwastewater, industrial activity ‚Äî including the oil\r\nindustry and maritime traffic ‚Äî and agriculture).\r\nThe report does not attempt to give an overall analysis\r\nof the state of the Mediterranean marine environment\r\nbut addresses in more detail some emerging issues in\r\nthe Mediterranean region. These issues are of concern\r\nfor maintaining a sustainable ecosystem and have\r\nbeen recognised as such in previous EEA reports\r\n(EEA, 1999; 2002). They include:\r\n‚Ä¢ Biological invasions which may cause\r\nsignificant changes to marine biodiversity,\r\nparticularly in the eastern basin;\r\n‚Ä¢ Unsustainable fisheries and aquaculture\r\npractises in certain Mediterranean countries,\r\nwhich may lead to overexploitation of living\r\nresources as well as have an impact on the\r\ncoastal and marine ecosystem, i.e. trawling on\r\nsea-bottom habitats and non-target species;\r\n‚Ä¢ Harmful Algal Blooms carry risks to human\r\nhealth across the Mediterranean Sea;\r\n‚Ä¢ Natural hazards and ecological quality status\r\nhave also been added to the list of emerging\r\nissues given the global interest they receive.\r\nFinally, it should be acknowledged that the core\r\ndata of this report were provided by the countries\r\nto UNEP/MAP. The report can be used to focus\r\non alternative policy options to help regional and\r\nnational policy-makers develop priority policy\r\nactions that will have a positive effect on the\r\nMediterranean marine environment.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2006-03-08","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Trawl Survey (1994‚Äì1999).

Nature protection is focussed on coastal areas and poor in all other parts of the ocean.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnsen, Torbj√∏rn","Nygaard, Kari","Olsgard, Frode"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M V Angel.

The report covers Europe from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains. It is based on expert contributions and comments from the countries involved in the biogeographical regions and seas. This chapter covers the Baltic Sea. A summary of the chapter is as follows:\r\n\r\n- The Baltic is the largest brackish water system in the world. Its only connection to more open seas are the shallow sounds between Sweden and Denmark.\r\n\r\n- The sea is slowly shrinking because of geological uplifting of land after the last glaciation.\r\n\r\n- In many respects the Baltic is similar to an inland lake or an estuary. It is unique in that there are areas where freshwater, brackish water and marine species are all\r\npresent. Its salinity increases from east to west and from north to south.\r\n\r\n- The marked vertical and horizontal salinity gradients are reflected in different species communities and species numbers. The highest biodiversity is found in the south-west of the Baltic Sea.\r\n\r\n- Many of the marine species are at the limit of their distributions.\r\n\r\n-The main threats to biodiversity in the Baltic Sea are:\r\n1 Eutrophication: this has caused increased amounts of planktonic algae, increased frequencies of toxic blooms of algae, the reduction of oxygen levels in the deep waters of the Baltic and a decline or disappearance of larger perennial macroalgae.\r\n2 Fisheries: Fishery of the main target fish species such as cod, herring, salmon and eel is presently unsustainable due to over-exploitation and impairment of conditions for reproduction. Bycatches of marine mammals, seabirds and non-target fish species are too high.\r\n3 Pollution by contaminants and oil: Organic contaminants have caused health and reproduction problems in marine mammals and birds. Oil has killed seabirds and negatively effected benthic communities.\r\n4 Introduction of non-indigenous species: Changes in the structure and components of the ecosystem are caused by introduced species. Intentional introduction, fouling and ballast water are three important ways organisms have been introduced into the Baltic Sea. The river\r\nconnections with the brackish waters in the Black and Caspian Seas increase the risk of introduction from these areas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walday, Mats","Kroglund, Tone"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Autio.

The report covers Europe from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains. It is based on expert contributions and comments from the countries involved in the biogeographical regions and seas.\r\n\r\nThis chapter covers the Arctic Ocean. Summary of the chapter is as follows:\r\n\r\n- The Arctic Ocean covers a large area with harsh climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n- There are strong seasonal and geographical variations in light, temperature and ice cover.\r\n\r\n- The European part of the Arctic Ocean covers only about 8 % of the total area of the Arctic Ocean,\r\nbut due to its great depth it represents about 25 % of the total volume.\r\n\r\n- The system of ocean currents induces an east‚Äìwest temperature gradient with warmer conditions in\r\nthe eastern part of the European Arctic Ocean, strongly influenced by the warm Gulf Stream. This\r\nkeeps the Norwegian Sea and a large part of the Barents Sea ice-free and favourable for the growth\r\nof a wide range of open-sea (pelagic) and bottom-living (benthic) species. This biological production\r\nsustains huge stocks of pelagic fish in these areas.\r\n\r\n- The extreme conditions in the area create unique marine ecosystems, and some species live on the\r\nborder of their tolerance.\r\n\r\n- Generally, the environmental quality of these waters is high, but there are several reasons for\r\nconcern, and an urgent need for more knowledge about the biological systems in this vulnerable\r\narea.\r\n\r\n- The main threats to biological diversity in the Arctic are:\r\n\r\n1 Extensive fishery is probably the greatest threat to biodiversity today. A better understanding\r\nof the effects of these fisheries is needed, especially of the effects of bycatch and effects on\r\nbenthic habitats.\r\n\r\n2 Effects of climatic changes are not yet unequivocally identified, but global warming can\r\ninfluence hydrographical conditions in the region. The recent possibility of ship passage\r\nalong the Siberian coast may be an indication of such effects.\r\n\r\n3 Accumulation of micro-contaminants in biota is of great concern, particularly since little is\r\nknown about the relation between levels of contaminants and biological effects. Discharges\r\nfrom industry in the Russian area of Murmansk are considerable and make up a substantial\r\npart of total industrial outputs to the Arctic. Long-distance transport of contaminants from\r\nother areas is an increasing cause for concern. Data are needed on trends in inputs of\r\ncontaminants and the geographical and temporal variation of their concentrations.\r\n\r\n4 Current and potential projects indicate that shipping probably will increase. The extreme\r\nclimatic conditions heighten the risk of accidents and complicate rescue and clean-up work,\r\nthus increasing the risks of environmental damage. Oil films are frequently detected on the\r\nsurface in areas of intense shipping. Other possible impacts of shipping are introduction of\r\nnon-indigenous species and biological effects of antifoulants.\r\n\r\n5 There is a great potential for oil exploration in the Barents Sea and it is therefore likely that\r\noil will pose a serious threat to marine life in the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walday, Mats"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"ACIA.

The report covers Europe from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains. It is based on expert contributions and comments from the countries involved in the biogeographical regions and seas.\r\n\r\nRanges of mountains constitute the alpine biogeographic region in Europe: It includes some of the oldest and most recent mountains of the world; the Alps, the Scandes, the Pyrenees, the Carpathians, the Rhodopes, the Urals, the Caucasia and the Dinaric Alps. Mountains are vulnerable ecosystems which exhibits a rich fauna and flora with a high level of endemism. Tourism, transportation, land-use change and also atmospheric pollution are strongly impacting many mountain areas. Climate change will affect the species composition and some. highland mountain species may become extinct. On the positive side is tat the values of mountainous ecosystems are increasingly being recognised in international political for a nd also regional initiatives are being launched for the protection and the sustainable development of Europe\u0027s mountains. Thus in some mountain ranges large herbivores and carnivores are making a comeback as a result of habitat protection and re-introduction initiatives.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Anonymus.

Their main area of use is in coastal zone management, whereby reefs are constructed to protect shorelines and areas of ecological importance or to rehabilitate and/or enhance inshore fisheries.  However, within the global field of artificial reef development there are many examples where the reefs have failed to produce any significant benefit.  Examples of poor reef construction are where the original purpose for the reef is either lacking or ill-considered; the construction materials are unsuited both to the marine environment or to any target species; the type of receiving environment and/or the scale of development are inappropriate; and there is a lack of any effective regulation and/or management.  As a consequence, artificial reefs command a poor reputation within many sectors associated with either managing or using the coastal environment.\r\n\r\nThe Loch Linnhe artificial reef complex has been constructed on the west coast of Scotland.  It is currently made up of 32 separate reefs within a fully replicated experimental matrix. The reefs consist of two sizes of reef module and each module is made up one of two types of reef block.  This permits issues of scale and habitat complexity to be studied in relation to colonization and habitat utilisation by commercially viable species.  A number of criteria had to be met in order to permit the reef‚Äôs deployment and these have generated a detailed research and monitoring programme that has been underway since 1998.  This paper discusses the planning and licencing issues surrounding an artificial reef development in the UK.  An overview will also be given of some of the design principles involved in attempting to optimize any commercial or environmental benefits.  Finally the paper will consider this and other studies within the terms of attempting to estimate the scales of development required to make any significant contribution toward alleviating the deficiencies of the system that triggered the intervention.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sayer, M","Wilding, T"],"dc:date":"2005-09-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99092,"sim:weight":0.482703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.363911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.356371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.347616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.344312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.342037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.34195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":14732,"ep:Repository":20,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Reputation management in decommissioning","bibo:abstract":"The aim of the paper is to explain what went wrong with the handling of the Brent Spar Issue in 1995, the lessons Shell and the Industry learnt from that incident and what has been put into place over the last 10 years.\r\n\t\r\nBecause of the association of any decommissioning project with the Brent Spar there are naturally some sensitivities and there will be a need for Shell to be seen to have learnt from the Brent Spar Issue. Brent Spar was damaging to our reputation in that the company was seen as acting without regard for the environment, although this was not so much an environmental problem.  The company failed to explain its decisions effectively to the outside world and did not win acceptance for its actions. \r\n\r\nIn 1995, the intense media controversy eventually lasted four months. Despite support by scientists for Shell‚Äôs plan of deep-sea disposal, the media and public reaction in key continental European countries was very negative for Shell. In Germany in particular, media, NGOs, churchmen and politicians joined forces leading a mass boycott of the Group. \r\nShell was portrayed in Germany as arrogant and irresponsible. The headline of an article in the biggest serious daily newspaper in Germany, the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, of June 16, 1995, read: ‚ÄúWith Brent Spar Shell is dumping its image‚Äø. In mid June some 50 Shell retail stations in Germany were damaged, - one fire-bombed and one even raked with bullets\r\nSeveral European governments approached the UK government and indicated opposition.\r\nWe recognised our analysis of the wider issues surrounding decommissioning and the external sensitivities it raised was too limited and our communication of the decision was poor.\r\nAfter Brent Spar, we recognised the need to learn lessons from our mistakes and to introduce changes within our organisation so that we would never again provoke such a conflict with other interested parties.\r\nWe must be open and transparent. In controversial matters, good science and regulatory compliance aren\u0027t enough. We must interest and inform people even if they initially seem to show little interest, and we must explain complex issues, but simply.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a mistake to underestimate objections on principle, or the commitment of those who make them. Public perceptions may be driven by feelings not facts, and instinctive feelings matter. We must build on our Spar experience so that neither interest groups nor we waste money and energy in conflict. We also need to share and understand differing perspectives. And independent third parties can help to build public trust.\r\n\r\nIn particular; the fact that we can be legally \u0027right\u0027, but still judged ‚Äòwrong‚Äô in a socio-ethical sense and social dimensions of risk are important and cannot readily be incorporated in to sound decision making through improved scientific knowledge or technical rigor alone.\r\nOver the last decade, we have been putting in place standards, management systems and processes to manage health, safety, environment and security issues better, by measuring and quantifying impacts of our actions on the communities in which we work. We are working fruitfully through trade and industry organisations to set standards that can be generally adopted by business.\r\nShell has adopted a seven-step approach to Issues Management.\r\n1.\tMonitor the business environment for likely impacts. \r\n2.\tIdentify the issues, and underlying factors, that might cause concern. \r\n3.\tPrioritise issues of concern by analysing their nature and immediacy. \r\n4.\tAnalyse in greater detail the priority issues, assign line responsibility, prioritise your internal and external stakeholders - then involve them. \r\n5.\tDecide on a strategy and marshal resources to target the issue. \r\n6.\tImplement the strategy with the help of briefing documents and allies, tracking the media to assess the response, and keeping employees informed. \r\n7.\tEvaluate the result to learn lessons, which should be shared. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is our aim that Shell companies should operate as good employers and good neighbours, respecting the environment and the communities in which they operate. The key to meeting this commitment is to maintain an open dialogue with local communities and other stakeholders so that our management is able to understand concerns and find ways to minimize impacts and maximize benefits of our activities.  Our aspiration is that, as far as possible, communities should be glad of Shell‚Äôs presence and be able to see the local benefits we bring. But sometimes we do not live up to the high standards that we wish to attain, and when things do go wrong, we want to be the first to know so we can act promptly.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dyer, P"],"dc:date":"2005-09-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90435,"sim:weight":0.338242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.307527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.305895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48414,"sim:weight":0.287502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.284967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48282,"sim:weight":0.281664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of only four front-runners in the UK tidal renewable energy arena, Marine Current Turbines Ltd, hopes to test its latest technology in this location because of its proximity to key infrastructure, low wave climate, low tidal range, high tidal power flux and a ready source of expertise at the nearby university marine laboratory.  \r\n\r\nTo this end, Royal Haskoning has been employed to assess the likely environmental impacts associated with a proposal to install one trial tidal turbine in the Narrows of Strangford Lough.  However, the process of preparing an Environmental Statement and agreeing the monitoring required after installation has been complex and has highlighted areas of uncertainty that are proving difficult to address.  This is mainly due to inherent limitations in our fundamental understanding (and methods of improving understanding) of marine ecosystems and the species they support.  It also highlights how the adoption of the precautionary principle, enshrined in the UK‚Äôs interpretation of the EC Habitats Directive, risks stifling renewable energy projects, with wider implications for UK targets to combat climate change.  Questions raised in this case include the use of monitoring with agreed actions to follow defined scenarios as mitigation and whether it is possible for renewable tidal energy to successfully co-exist with ecologically sensitive systems and their components.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mallows, T"],"dc:date":"2005-09-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26424,"sim:weight":0.324612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84223,"sim:weight":0.290639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":479,"sim:weight":0.290093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.286476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84278,"sim:weight":0.285036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.243249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.243249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84284,"sim:weight":0.241937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.239571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97600,"sim:weight":0.219263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385438,"sim:weight":0.210645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.205481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97653,"sim:weight":0.202479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.1942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271215,"sim:weight":0.186152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105180,"sim:weight":0.185285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27914,"sim:weight":0.185195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710656,"sim:weight":0.184262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84246,"sim:weight":0.179527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494504,"sim:weight":0.177449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It will provide a well defined and monitored site with electrical connection to the onshore electricity grid and will greatly simplify and shorten the legal consents process for developers. Wave Hub would reduce the risk for developers of the first pre-commercial wave machine arrays. If it goes ahead, Wave Hub could be commissioned by 2007.\r\nA number of engineering options have been considered, based on what is technically sound and achievable, has minimum environmental impact, is cost-effective and does not present significant safety and operational issues. An environmental impact assessment is underway which will involve an analysis of the potential impacts of the project on the environment. This will include the effects of laying the cable (most of which will be offshore) and the impacts of the likely arrays of wave energy devices on marine ecology, fisheries, recreational users and navigation. There will be very little terrestrial land-take, with only one cable coming ashore, terminating near the site of a disused power station.\r\nThe potential benefits are numerous and include: Recognition of the South West region as a leader in the field of wave power electricity generation: Creation of  100 jobs directly, and be a catalyst for the creation of an entire new industry building on the South West\u0027s traditional strengths of maritime and engineering expertise. Jobs could be created through the manufacturing, deploying, maintaining, inspecting, repairing and decommissioning the potentially wide range of devices: The indirect benefits of such an industry are calculated at up to 450 new jobs and ¬£15 million a year to the regional economy by 2010, rising to around 700 jobs and ¬£27 million a year by 2020.

{"identifier":14740,"ep:Repository":20,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Marine Current Turbines ‚Ñ¢: progress with tidal turbine development","bibo:abstract":"Tidal stream (and ocean current)  technology is one of the most recent forms of renewable energy to be developed.  Arguably it is being pioneered in the UK yet it  has only been supported by the UK government since 2001.  However, today it is a key part of the DTI‚Äôs (Department of Trade \u0026 Industry‚Äôs) R\u0026D programme having real potential to make a significant contribution to the UK‚Äôs (and the rest of the world‚Äôs) Kyoto targets. \r\n\r\nIn principle the physical principles of tidal stream turbines have a lot in common with those of wind turbines, since the technology consists of devices that use flowing water in much the same way that wind turbines use flowing air to produce electricity. So an advantage of tidal stream technology compared with the other so-called ‚Äúwet renewables‚Äø wave and OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion) technology, is that it is relatively straightforward to engineer, being based on well-understood concepts that in many cases have already been developed in the context of wind turbines. The most important advantage of tidal or marine current powered systems is that their output is predictable with a reasonable degree of certainty (the tides can be predicted for the entire life-cycle of a device); therefore tidal turbines can offer electricity which is inherently more valuable than the much more randomly generated output of wind, wave and solar devices.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúSeaflow‚Äø is a landmark energy project - the first phase of  the first R\u0026D programme intended to lead to the development of commercially viable, tidal powered electricity generators.  However there are only relatively few sea areas with high enough average tidal current velocities needed for cost-effective energy recovery.  In practice locations are needed with mean spring peak tidal currents faster than about 4 to 5 knots (2 to 2.5 m/s) or the energy density will be inadequate to allow an economically viable project.  Such locations are found at ‚Äúpinch points‚Äø where the underwater topography causes currents to accelerate, such as straits between islands and the mainland and shallows around headlands.  \r\n\r\nMarine Current Turbines Ltd has started work on designing Seagen, the successor to Seaflow, a twin rotor system with its rotors mounted either side of a tubular pile. While Seaflow, the first phase of the R\u0026D programme, was intended to be no more than an experimental test bed, Seagen is Marine Current Turbines Ltd‚Äôs most important development as it is the prototype for commercial power generating technology to follow.  While Seaflow proved technical feasibility, Seagen is needed to prove the economic and commercial feasibility.\r\n\r\nIn the face of the huge crises developing due to Global Warming and Peak Oil, there is an urgent need to prove and bring on stream new clean energy technologies such as tidal turbines.  It can be anticipated that security of supply will increasingly preoccupy the governments of industrialised countries all of which need to find huge new clean energy supplies.  The technology under development by Marine Current Turbines Ltd has the potential to contribute to solving this problem and we hope and expect it to be commercially viable well within the next five years.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fraenkel, P, L"],"dc:date":"2005-09-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25779,"sim:weight":0.630991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.487847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.421591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.372908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.365152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.358711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.358442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.358124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.355137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Early evaluation therefore of how development might impact on this wealth of historic evidence is now a key consideration.  In part, this reflects how English Heritage‚Äôs remit, since the National Heritage Act 2002, extends over the territorial waters of England, but also our work with offshore developers to publish guidance that details suitable methodologies to help safeguard both the known and unknown archaeological material on and within the seabed.  English Heritage over the past few years has also promoted its responsibilities through the publication of documents, such as Taking to the Water: English Heritages\u0027 Initial Policy for the Management of Maritime Archaeology in England and the advent of the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Marine Fund (ALSF) in 2002 has certainly been of major benefit in the development of a research agenda to support our policy objectives.   Such activity has helped to build appreciation of the importance of the maritime historic environment and to expand on work to date with groups such as the British Marine Aggregate Producers Association.  However, other work by central government is on-going that will have a bearing on how we deliver our responsibilities.  For example, in autumn 2004 the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) undertook a public consultation on the Review of Heritage Protection entitled Protecting our Marine Historic Environment: Making the System Work Better.  We have provided our detailed comment and DCMS analysis of all the responses is awaited.  In 2005 we will contribute to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Marine Spatial Planning Pilot study in the Irish Sea and through the ALSF examine how historic environment characterisation can be applied to the marine environment.  The Queen‚Äôs speech in May this year introduced the draft Marine Bill and English Heritage will ensure that appropriate attention is given to the marine historic environment.  It is therefore essential that we maintain the momentum and continue to develop best practice, as demonstrated by the updating of the Code of Practice for Seabed Developers with the joint Nautical Archaeological Policy Committee.  However, we reinforce the message that it is never too early to include the marine historic environment in the assessment of offshore development proposals and to seek the participation of English Heritage.  Marine spatial planning is now coming to the fore and as an active participant we will ensure sustainable development encompasses a full appreciation of our wealth of maritime archaeology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pater, C","Oxley, I"],"dc:date":"2005-09-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.430016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.406049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14912,"sim:weight":0.386628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84289,"sim:weight":0.378523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84246,"sim:weight":0.334166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14863,"sim:weight":0.320043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.313387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.311224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The traditional approach purports in essence to divide the ocean into several jurisdictional spaces on the basis of two opposing principles, namely, the principle of sovereignty and the principle of freedom. It is now apparent, however, that the traditional zonal approach is insufficient to resolve the problems encountered in the management of ocean space. Hence, the need for a new integrated management approach is increasingly emphasised in international instruments as well as in the opinions of writers. Nevertheless, it appears that the concept of the integrated management approach remains obscure in international law. Thus, this study purports to examine this concept at three levels: the ecological, normative and implementation levels. Finally, on the basis of these considerations, this study will present a perspective that the international law of the sea should be considered as a dialectic legal system between the zonal approach and the integrated management approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tanaka, Y."],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98962,"sim:weight":0.600473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.518844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":658869,"sim:weight":0.460044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99223,"sim:weight":0.459805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99156,"sim:weight":0.446811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99092,"sim:weight":0.443606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513386,"sim:weight":0.424223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99128,"sim:weight":0.410067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.408906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929884,"sim:weight":0.407723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.404654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99332,"sim:weight":0.400634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.395211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.394068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18209,"sim:weight":0.380776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.372621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381989,"sim:weight":0.369758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108611,"sim:weight":0.362021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631608,"sim:weight":0.353639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930217,"sim:weight":0.339406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The potential application of European environmental law the Habitats Directive) to protect deep-water coral in the maritime areas beyond the territorial sea and the interaction between European environmental law and the European common fisheries policy are discussed.

In this paper, based on observations in both Northern Ireland and the\r\nRepublic of Ireland, mode of land tenure is assessed to determine its influence on the conservation management of coastal dunes. The tenure types considered are: private\r\nownership, corporate private ownership, tenancy, secured tenancy, leasing, common (joint) ownership, uncertain ownership, public ownership and its subset military ownership. It is suggested that multiple private ownership is least likely to favour effective conservation management. Public ownership by a statutory conservation authority and corporate private ownership by a conservation-orientated NGO are regarded as the optimum tenure types for conservation management of coastal dunes.","bibo:AuthorList":["McKenna, J.","MacLeod, M.","Cooper, J.A.G.","O\u0027Hagan, A.M.","Power, J."],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Atkinson and J Houston.

This is happening at a time when demographic studies are revealing increased population densities in coastal areas, and indeed, growth in the population of the whole region. In this paper, these issues are reviewed and examined in some detail. The options available to environmental managers and policy makers are discussed. In particular, a shift away from chemical monitoring to biological effects studies is advocated, as is the need for a more integrated approach to policy formulation and implementation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Depledge, Michael H."],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Y Azov.

This study examined the history of shoreline change at the site and concluded that the shoreline was historically stable. Since there was no geomorphological justification for the fence it was concluded that the current, and earlier sand fences had been erected essentially as visitor control devices.

Management for Golf and Nature on the Sefton Coast","bibo:abstract":"Output from Sefton Coast Life Project (1996-1999). Golf courses have been a feature of the landscape of the Sefton Coast for over a century. The vast extent of sand dunes provided excellent terrain with marvellous views and were judged to be as good as the sandy links of the east coast of Scotland where the game first became popular. The first course on the Sefton Coast was developed by the West Lancashire Golf Club at Crosby in 1873, towards the southern end of the dune system.  Since then, clubs have established courses along the length and breadth of the coast, with a present-day total of seven dune-land courses.  Foster (1997) in Links along the Line has written an excellent account of the history and development of golf courses on the Sefton Coast.\r\n\r\nGolf courses today occupy over a quarter of the dune area, 550 ha out of a total of some 2000 ha, and much of this area includes the EU priority habitats of fixed dune and dune heath, with associated species such as the protected Sand Lizard Lacerta agilis. It is therefore essential, for the overall conservation of the dune system, that golf course management is sympathetic to nature and that clubs help to conserve their semi-natural duneland habitats.","bibo:AuthorList":["Simpson, D.E.","Rooney, P.J.","Houston, J.A."],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A S Cooke.

A Report by Cardiff University to the Wales Coastal and Maritime Partnership and the National Assembly for Wales","bibo:abstract":"There is currently considerable interest in, and\r\ndevelopment of, policy related to the management\r\nof the marine and coastal environment in the EU,\r\nUK and Wales. Some policy developments,\r\nparticularly the Government‚Äôs Marine Stewardship\r\nprocess and its associated publications and\r\nreviews, have far reaching implications for the\r\nmanagement of Welsh coasts, challenging the\r\ntraditional sectoral focus of management. However,\r\nthere is concern that, with so many cross-cutting\r\nand related policy initiatives and programmes under\r\ndevelopment, there is the potential for confusion,\r\nmissed opportunities and duplication of effort. This\r\nproject, therefore, identifies and reviews selected\r\npolicies and programmes as well as clarifying\r\ncurrent and potential linkages and synergies. It also\r\naims to identify gaps hindering an integrated\r\napproach to the management of our coast.\r\nThe EC Recommendation on Integrated Coastal\r\nZone Management (ICZM), requiring Member\r\nStates to develop and implement a national strategy\r\nfor ICZM, is a major driver for change, promoting a\r\nnew system of governance for coastal areas.\r\nFollowing the UK-wide stocktake of ICZM, each\r\nhome country is producing an ICZM strategy in\r\naddition to the UK-overarching ICZM strategy that is\r\nbeing developed. The Welsh ICZM strategy is under\r\ndevelopment, being prepared by a sub-group of the\r\nWales Coastal and Maritime Partnership (WCMP).\r\nTo inform this process, it is necessary to have a\r\ndetailed and clear understanding of the specific\r\npressures affecting the Welsh coast as well as a\r\nview of how these are likely to change in future. The\r\nsecond major aim of the study is, therefore, to carry\r\nout an analysis of key sectors to identify current and\r\nfuture coastal pressures.\r\nThis non-technical summary highlights the key\r\nproject findings. Reference to the main report\r\nshould be made for a more detailed discussion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ballinger, Rhoda","Gubbay, Sue","Stojanovic, Tim","Ball, Iwan","Taussik, Jane","Smith, Hance"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84284,"sim:weight":0.599706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.372072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.372072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.369309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84240,"sim:weight":0.360826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.360222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.351836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.345706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It describes governments‚Äô strategic goals for the marine environment, and summarises our existing commitments to biodiversity conservation. It also presents some of the key issues that will need to be considered when the UK begins to develop an integrated, ecosystem approach to management.\r\n\r\nBuilding on recent UK commitments to sustainable development and implementation of the ecosystem approach, it is thought that a management framework centred around ecosystem objectives will help decision-makers and regulators in their management of human activity in the marine environment. The Government is considering the role they could play in proposals for inclusion in the Marine Bill. The purpose of the paper is to set the scene and highlight key issues that should be considered during the development of ecosystem objectives. In particular, this paper will contribute to discussions at the Manchester technical workshop 31 Oct to 1 Nov. Further practical work including contracted studies, and technical and stakeholder workshops, will be required to develop more detailed proposals for marine ecosystem objectives for the UK.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rogers, S.I.","Tasker, M","Whitmee, D"],"dc:date":"2005-10","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"CabinetOffice.

Final Report - section 1","bibo:abstract":"The coastal land, estuaries, and inshore waters of the UK are rich in natural resources and wildlife. They support a large proportion of the population and a great variety of economic activity. Decision-makers concerned with coastal planning and management have to reconcile and manage potentially competing activities and interests. Historically, policies and decisions have been made from the viewpoint of individual sectors, but there are risks and difficulties with this approach. Poor co-ordination of actions on the ground, inconsistent decisionmaking, unclear overall direction and an adversarial rather than co-operative approach to managing activities at the coast can often arise as a result. The greatest risk however, is not being able to achieve the combined environmental, economic and social potential of sustainable development. In recent decades, many sectoral interests have recognised the need for a more consistent, integrated, and visionary approach to working and to managing their activities at the coast. Ideas of how this might be achieved have been enshrined into an approach known as ‚Äòintegrated coastal zone management‚Äô, which seeks to integrate policies and actions across sectors, as well as recognising the interlinked nature of the natural environment of coastal land, estuaries and inshore waters.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2004-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"EC.

In 2002, the European Parliament and the European Council of Ministers recommended that Member States follow eight principles in formulating national strategies for ICZM and any subsequent measures based on these strategies. \r\nThe findings of this report are based on research carried out in 2003, using questionnaires, interviews, workshops, Stocktake Panels and case study reports. These methods were used to gather the views of coastal practitioners in the UK.

A review of trust ports was undertaken by DETR Ports Division in 1998.

The review concluded that the concept of a trust port had stood the test of time and continues to perform a valuable role in support of the local, regional and national economy. However, it highlighted a need for general improvement in the openness and accountability with\r\nwhich trusts conducted their business.

It comprises a review of the body of published literature covering issues of social inequality in natural hazard research. After a brief overview of the background to the research study (Section 1.2), the literature review is presented in three sections. Section 2 explores the concept of vulnerability in relation to natural hazard events. The categories and characteristics of vulnerability found to be particularly at risk in terms of natural hazard and hazard warning are outlined in Section 3. Section 4 serves as a brief conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this report is to review and synthesise the existing literature on issues of social inequality in natural hazard research. Its purpose was three-fold: to identify what is currently known and what remains to be investigated; to provide a basis for the second stage of the research study by highlighting appropriate targets and discussion topics for interviews with key informant and victims of flood (see companion Report W5C-018/3); and to identify existing and potential social indicators for use in secondary data analysis (see companion Report W5C-018/2).Its intention was to be thorough and inclusive without the unnecessary rehearsal of material already well known to the Environment Agency.\r\n\r\nThe starting point for the literature review was a reading of reports provided by the Agency to ascertain the extent of research findings already known to them, widening\r\nthe search to find any follow-up studies and research in progress. This was followed by a search of libraries, relevant websites and on-line electronic databases, including Ingenta, Bids and Web of Science.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thrush, D","Burningham, K","Fielding, J"],"dc:date":"2005-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Bj√∂rkman.

{"identifier":84451,"ep:Repository":20,"dc:type":["Other","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Consultation on Offshore Wind Farm","bibo:abstract":": Robin Rigg sand banks was identified as a potential location for an offshore wind farm development.  An EIA was undertaken on the proposal, which was for up to 60 turbines.The Partnership provided the local network which ensured that the EIA was undertaken in complete consultation with the local communities and interest groups.  The geographical scale of the Solway and the communities affected by the Solway required this central co-ordination.  In simple terms, for every organisation, e.g. the RSPB, there are two local offices, one in England and one in Scotland.  The Partnership facilitated the setting up of local area meetings and in some cases provided local links to important scientific data.Throughout the consultation the Partnership ran workshops at its annual conferences and published updates in its newsletter. This increased the scope of participation in the debate.  The coverage from the Partnership was not biased towards the developers.  Local groups who opposed the wind farm were given opportunities to put their case, which included slots at the conference and in the newsletter.The work has been ongoing for over two years.The development has now been approved by the Scottish Executive and the Partnership is playing a central role in ensuring that local communities are able to benefit from the wind farm.  This includes working with the developers to ensure that they support local community projects.As for difficulties, Partnership staff were fortunate to have good guidance from our partners and this ensured that the Partnership remained a neutral player throughout the debate.  This is important as the Partnership has no official role in the formal consultation and it is useful for all parties to have a central contact point for information.  Furthermore, different partners had different opinions and therefore it would have potentially been damaging to take a one sided standpoint.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84495,"sim:weight":0.620637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84474,"sim:weight":0.564071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84604,"sim:weight":0.500896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.447882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43987,"sim:weight":0.416152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.413061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2747848,"sim:weight":0.302226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45170,"sim:weight":0.298245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.298062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46640,"sim:weight":0.294175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96309,"sim:weight":0.287039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.280004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.260381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.260381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.260381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.260381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.260381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.260381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.260381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.260381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Thames Estuary Partnership has co-ordinated the exchange of relevant information and raw data from DLG partners to a GIS-based Information Exchange System (IES) being developed and maintained by the Port of London Authority.

Subjects were based on needs expressed by MFP members through the development of the Moray Firth Management Guidelines and Action Programme.  The seminars aimed to share knowledge and exchange experience from within and out with the Firth and Scotland and to improve practical responses to management issues.  A further aim was to encourage a sustainable approach to coastal management, dialogue between interested groups and partnership working.¬∑\tThis topic was ideal for the Cromarty Firth as an example of an industrialised estuary covered by international nature conservation designations.  By leading and funding one of the MFP seminars, CFLG not only met ERDF outputs and fulfilled a number of actions from the CF Action Plan, but also avoided duplication of effort and resources, illustrating commitment to full integration of the Partnerships in Jan 02.¬∑\tThe seminar explored the relationship between coastal industrial developments, impacts on the environmental assets of the CF and the cost benefit implications.  Delegates heard presentations that focussed on strategic issues such as ICZM, economic development and stewardship of the environment from a national and local perspective, illustrated by presentations from speakers representing a range of industries from around the Firth and beyond, discussing methods of management practise with a view to promoting good practise.¬∑\tThe seminar was particularly successful at promoting the concept of ICZM and explaining how CZM is about bringing the relevant people together and getting them to discuss their strategies and policies, so the issues of development and environment can be aligned without competing with each other.  The message got across that the commercial sectors and those with an interest in economic development realise that they can work together with organisations such as SEPA and SNH.¬∑\tThe seminar was successful in stimulating debate about examples of best practice and sustainable management solutions from the range of industries around the Firth, with delegates fully contributing to the debate on management solutions that worked (and those that didn‚Äôt) and having the opportunity to talk to people with similar issues, concerns or experiences.¬∑\tProblems regarding access to good quality data, especially environmental data was a key issue.  A Partnership approach to this was seen as the only way forward with the coastal fora seen as an Partnership to co-ordinate such a multi sectoral project.¬∑\tAlthough aimed to have broad appeal, this seminar was aimed at industry, business and statutory organisations as well as community and interest groups.  Both CFLG and MFP recognised the need to involve the private sector more in partnership projects and although difficult initially, the seminar attracted a good range of representatives from the private sector.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84604,"sim:weight":0.515621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84477,"sim:weight":0.49368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.320177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84225,"sim:weight":0.308101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.293108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43987,"sim:weight":0.286682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.270947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Association formed in 1996, employed a project officer in October 2001, and produced a Foundation Document in March 2003. One of the main difficulties is that some of the 38 relevant authorities do not have the staffing capabilities to identify the activities for which they are responsible, the impacts they may cause or management solutions. This makes co-ordinating a programme that all members can keep to very difficult and frustrating for those who are able, or put in the required effort, to meet program deadlines.One of the successes to date has been the increased awareness of the implications of the Directives among relevant authorities for the Severn Estuary European marine site. This should help in the relevant authorities identifying common causes of deterioration or disturbance to the designated features and being able to co-operatively implement management solutions in a co-ordinated estuary-wide approach.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84604,"sim:weight":0.436411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84240,"sim:weight":0.42997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.270042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.221789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48424,"sim:weight":0.212996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271215,"sim:weight":0.205777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.19856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In 1999, a voluntary management group was established to oversee the development of a strategy to protect the site from potential human impacts. This group was facilitated by the MFP. A further qualifying interest feature - ‚Äúsandbanks‚Äø was added to the cSAC in March 2001. In January 2002, the ‚ÄòMoray Firth cSAC Management Scheme‚Äô was launched to establish and maintain the dolphin population and its habitat and to avoid any significant damage or disturbance to the dolphins through the implementation of 100 agreed voluntary and statutory management actions. The Scheme is committed to deliver these actions in a way that promotes the sustainable development of existing legal activities and interests. Some of the actions were already part of routine practice whilst others were new and have subsequently been incorporated into the management priorities and plans of relevant organisations.   A process of compliance monitoring was established. The MFP has collated the first annual report on monitoring in 2002. Protocols for monitoring the dolphins will be developed on the back of generic guidelines currently being developed by the Inter Agency Monitoring Group‚Äôs National Monitoring Guidance for marine mammals. SNH will develop monitoring protocols for the sandbank feature. Lessons learned¬∑\tLimited knowledge of bottlenose dolphins and sandbanks and the effect that human activities have upon them have presented challenges when drawing up and implementing the Scheme. ¬∑\tComplex nature of some of the issues (e.g. discharge of ballast water, food availability) also presented difficulties as resolution requires action through international collaboration and sharing of trans-boundary responsibilities. ¬∑\tSome proposed measures are not easily monitored or enforced due to lack of resources, funding constraints, the geographical extent of the cSAC area or shortfalls in the existing legislation (e.g. dealing with reports of deliberate harassment or disturbance to dolphins). ¬∑\tPublic in general and some sectors of activity were not sufficiently aware of the influence of their practices on the marine environment. ¬∑\tLimited communication between agencies and the difference in organisational priorities have made implementation of some of the actions (particularly those where responsibilities are shared between lead bodies) relatively complex.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84604,"sim:weight":0.362858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.223235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.203226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96309,"sim:weight":0.199282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.194753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105180,"sim:weight":0.194122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.193966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The project was established in 2002 after increasing complaints regarding boat behaviour were received. The Marine Code group set up to develop codes of conduct applicable to Pembrokeshires coastline for all marine based recreational and leisure activities.  Initially developed with local wildlife tour operators and dive charter operators, the ultimate aim is to encourage all user groups to adopt the codes of conduct whilst participating in any such water based activities. By Encouraging the adoption of the codes and related zoning the group aims to maintain a sustainable level of participation whilst ensuring that the diversity of wildlife and habitats is protected.The difficulties that have arisen are not atypical and reflect those of similar initiative with private, public and voluntary sector membership.  There has been a lack of trust and perception of imposed restriction between private sector members and those from statutory or regulatory organisations which lead to difficulty in achieving consensus.These have been overcome through the honesty of all those taking part. Developing communications between sectors and allowing frank discussion at all stages has enabled private sector members to develop a sense of ownership of the project.Overall the trail of the project has been very successful, though the overall success will depend on the uptake by recreational users groups.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84537,"sim:weight":0.683417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84604,"sim:weight":0.408622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84225,"sim:weight":0.30173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.268038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.267373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.249969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In addition to the ongoing theme of nature conservation management, current issues include: access, interpretation, archaeology, research, tourism, shoreline management, beach management \u0026 water quality, woodland management.Successes: In its early years the partnership turned a piece of coast that was approaching serious dereliction into a valued local and regional recreation resource. Since then there has been progressive improvement through land purchase, better beach management and proactive nature conservation management to maintain and enhance the quality of the resource. This was reflected recently in a substantial increase in the area of national and EU designated areas along the coast.Difficulties include the constant search for resources to support coastal work, as well as ensuring the views of local communities are taken into account in management decisions. The latter has led to changes in the structure and working methods of the Partnership.

For too long people have considered the sea as an endless\r\nspace in which there is plenty of room for sea bound activities and activities banned on land. In the\r\npast industrial waste and all other kinds of waste have been dumped into the sea. Today there is a\r\nrush to build offshore windmill farms and to increase offshore sand and gravel exploitation.\r\nTomorrow it will be something else. Past activities were mainly planned on an ad hoc basis,\r\nlooking for spots that did not interfere with already existing activities at sea and without taking into\r\naccount the ecological important land-sea interactions, the ecosystems and habitats and the needs of\r\nthe coastal population. This was particularly the case in Belgium, with its small coastline of 65 km\r\nand a total sea area of 3,600 km2 under its jurisdiction. Lots of activities are taking place in this sea\r\narea, called ‚Äúthe Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS)‚Äø. Most of those activities were not well\r\nplanned. It is clear that while the principles of spatial structure planning on land are useful as\r\nguidelines, they will need to be adapted to the specifics of the marine environment, both in terms of\r\nthe legislative framework and environmental constraints.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maes, F"],"dc:date":"2005-09-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84246,"sim:weight":0.493468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84244,"sim:weight":0.470314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.461365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664587,"sim:weight":0.442618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84241,"sim:weight":0.429143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271215,"sim:weight":0.422836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.41774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9285,"sim:weight":0.410748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84410,"sim:weight":0.40708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.406547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.395201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.395201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.381932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.381932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.381932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.381932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.381932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.381932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.381932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.381932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, this means\r\ndeciding on actions such as:\r\n‚Ä¢ construction of new defences where they are most needed;\r\n‚Ä¢ maintaining and operating defences and defence systems to minimise risk;\r\n‚Ä¢ flood forecasting and warning to minimise the consequences in the event of flooding;\r\n‚Ä¢ restricting development in flood and erosion-prone areas to control the impacts. The need for improved risk assessment methodologies to support better flood risk\r\nmanagement has therefore been the primary driver in support of the RASP project. The methods that have been developed through the RASP project will help the Environment Agency and Defra to understand more about how flood defences, and investment in flood management, influence flood risk. In particular, they provide a significantly improved ability to predict the spatial distribution of both the probability and consequences of flooding taking defence performance into account.\r\nThe RASP methods enact the basic cross-government framework for environmental risk assessment and risk management as well as addressing the specific needs presented by flood risk management. By enacting these frameworks within a generalised hierarchical\r\nmethodology RASP enables sources (including a wide range of extreme wave and water level combinations), pathways (including the performance of multiple defences expressed in terms of a fragility curve) and receptors (including people and property) of risk to be combined. RASP therefore provides an important step towards an improved\r\nability to manage flood risk in an integrated way.\r\nThe RASP methods have been shown to provide a rational risk-based framework for the development of flood management policy, allocation of resources and monitoring the performance of flood mitigation activities at national regional and local scales; addressing strategic and overarching issues directly, such as:\r\n‚Ä¢ what is the probability and consequence of flooding, and how do they vary within the flood plain?\r\n‚Ä¢ what is the appropriate level of spending on flood and coastal defence to ensure risk is reduced, including the possible effects of climate change?\r\n‚Ä¢ what combination of risk management measures provides the best value?\r\n‚Ä¢ what is the \u0027residual risk\u0027 remaining after all risk management measures, and is this\r\nacceptable?\r\nIn particular, RASP provides a hierarchy of methods to support the assessment of flood risk at a range of scales (national, regional, local) and levels of detail. At each scale the RASP methods are focused on understanding the probability of flooding at a particular location within the floodplain taking account of the protection afforded by defences.The notion of a system-based analysis (considering sources, pathways and receptors) is therefore fundamental to RASP. Equally important, and implicit within the RASP approach, is the concept of appropriateness; where the complexity of the analysis reflects the availability of data and the nature of the decision being made.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2004-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Environment Agency.

It arose in response to the proposal for a tidal barrage across the estuary, and commissioned The University of Liverpool‚Äôs  Department of Civic Design to produce a Management Plan. This was published in 1995, and the Strategy has since been fronted by a Steering Group representing a broad partnership of interests around the Estuary.  The Steering Group is informed by technical working groups, and many  individual projects attract funding from private sector partners.The objective of the Strategy is the long term sustainable management of the estuary. The estuary is of significant size, with a tidal range of approximately 10m (HAT). It represents the waterfront for over 1m people in the Mersey conurbation; the ports handle 40m tonnes of goods annually, and it is a major wildlife habitat with national and international habitat designations. Subject to funding, the Strategy is a long term commitment. Successes: The Mersey Estuary Management Plan (MEMP) provides the strategic context for policy and management plan formulation in the estuary zone, and is now recognised in Local Development Plans.  The MEMP is also linked to the Environment Agency‚Äôs (EA) lower Mersey Local Environment Agency Plan (LEAP). An annual action plan is also produced by the Strategy.  The Mersey Strategy was a significant factor in the Mersey Basin Campaign‚Äôs International River Basin Award (2000), and has been instrumental in the formulation of the Mersey Waterfront Regional Park.  Successes are outlined in more detail in ‚ÄòOutcomes‚Äô and ‚ÄòOutputs.‚ÄôDifficulties: Ensuring continuity through funding problems (what‚Äôs new?); catching and keeping people‚Äôs interest; keeping technical groups going; business planning of activities.","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84604,"sim:weight":0.483002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84240,"sim:weight":0.462934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84472,"sim:weight":0.342751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84483,"sim:weight":0.28549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84470,"sim:weight":0.283486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.180343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.170294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.169551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Many stand in deep water, up to 1200 feet, making them very difficult and expensive to remove.  Expeditious removal of these platforms is a high priority for most environmental groups in a State decidedly hostile to the oil industry and jealously protective of its beautiful and environmentally sensitive coastline.  However, the inevitability of these removal projects has been upset by facts and circumstances that could not have been foreseen a decade ago, when a small team of marine scientists from the University of California at Santa Barbara began to study the underwater portions of these platforms.  They discovered thriving marine habitats supporting important fish species that are severely depleted in their natural environments.  In response to a broad constituency of ocean users, the California Artificial Reef Enhancement Program (CARE) has taken up the challenge to save these marine habitats through a combination of research to define the ecological role of these artificial reefs and public awareness programs to build a coalition of ocean users to support their preservation.  The important question is now finally being asked: What is the best way to decommission the California oil and gas platforms?","bibo:AuthorList":["Raftican, T","Steinbach, G"],"dc:date":"2005-09-15","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Gebauer.

These were built with the highest and rigorous structural integrity of engineering technologies by the energy industrial sector over the years. Nevertheless, many of these installations are coming to the end of their operational life cycles and require decommissioning. Over the years, BMT marine consultants and research scientists have provided expert environmental impact assessments of the decommissioning of offshore platforms. In particular, the short and long term environmental impact of the decommissioning programme are achieved with advanced environmental modelling scenarios to assist  management-decision making (BMT, UKOOA* I, II, III projects 1999-2005). While taking on board the specific nature of marine environmental conditions, ecosystem, habitats and long term environmental impact, the re-use of offshore structures requires the adoption of modern integrated coastal information management methods and spatial planning. In this conference presentation, BMT provides a holistic numerical modelling approach for decision making and best practices in the re-use of fixed industrial offshore platforms. Modern concepts of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) are highly emphasized and recommended in the approach (BMT, Orchestra project 2004-2007). This assures the safeguard of coastal environments, economies, societal requirements and consensusl among coastal zone stakeholder communities. \r\n\r\n*UKOOA: UK Oil Operators Association","bibo:AuthorList":["Sabeur, Dr Z, A","Batt, P, I"],"dc:date":"2005-09-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45737,"sim:weight":0.34564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84291,"sim:weight":0.176986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84244,"sim:weight":0.173835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84410,"sim:weight":0.163215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61101,"sim:weight":0.150487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.141213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.141213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.138226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.12351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.12174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271215,"sim:weight":0.119727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.116182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61873,"sim:weight":0.114957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.113097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386725,"sim:weight":0.112333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386728,"sim:weight":0.111898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.109447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.109447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.109447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.109447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
