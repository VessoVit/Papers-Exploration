Biomass burning accounts for a significant fraction (40%) of global BC emissions, both from wildfires and human activities such as slash-and-burn deforestation, crop-residue burning and prescribed fires used for land management. Trace gas and aerosol emission factors, including BC, change with different combustion conditions and thus the amount of BC in smoke shows considerable variation. Freshly emitted smoke changes with time to become a regional haze, a process not well understood. There are large uncertainties regarding the processes through which BC becomes mixed with primary and secondary aerosol species and the extent to which mixing state affects the radiative properties of BC. Further understanding of these areas will lead to improvements in the treatment of biomass burning BC in global climate modelling and more accurate predictions of its impacts on climate and visibility.  \r\n\r\n\tProperties of biomass burning aerosols were investigated using airborne sampling with a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) (Droplet Measurement Technologies, Boulder, Colorado). During the field study, the SP2 was mounted on the US Forest Service (USFS) Twin Otter aircraft and flown through smoke plumes from prescribed fires as part of the SLOBB (San Luis Obispo Biomass Burning experiment) campaign in California in November 2009. Plumes were sampled on scales ranging from near-source to 60 km downwind. We present BC size distributions and emission factors. An analysis of particle aging behaviour combining the SP2 measurements with aerosol composition measurements made simultaneously by an Aerodyne compact Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) is also presented. Data collected from an Airborne Fourier-Transform Infrared spectrometer (AFTIR) system provided information regarding several important trace gas species emitted from fires and allowed for a better determination of plume aging processes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Taylor, Jonathan W"],"dc:date":"2010-07-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J P 1Schwarz.

VOCALS, the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study, is examining the climate system of the southeast Pacific to reduce uncertainties in current and future climate projections, especially those associated with marine stratocumulus and coupled ocean-atmosphere processes.  As part of VOCALS-UK we are investigating the small-scale structure and microphysics of marine stratocumulus, and hence its radiative properties, by using the UK Met Office Large Eddy Model (LEM).  The model simulations are validated against measurements from the BAe-146 research aircraft obtained during the VOCALS field campaign over the southeast Pacific in October and November 2008.\r\n\r\nWe have incorporated the new Morrison microphysics scheme into the LEM and compared simulations with the Morrison scheme to those from the LEM standard bulk microphysics.  Simulations with the Morrison scheme tend to produce a deeper marine stratocumulus with increased Liquid Water Path (LWP), but reduced precipitation compared to the standard LEM scheme.  The cloud droplet effective radii (Re) is increased as not all the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are activated, so that radiative cooling at the cloud tops, vertical mixing and cloud top entrainment are all reduced.  Overall, results from the Morrison scheme are in better agreement with the measurements.\r\n\r\nWe then carried out sensitivity studies to quantify the effects of increased CCN number concentration, entrainment of clean air at cloud top, and precipitation on the simulated clouds and their radiative properties, including the inhomogenity over different domain sizes.  Increased CCN results in reduced Re, increased albedo, cloud top cooling, vertical mixing and entrainment, and reduced LWP, inhomogeneity and precipitation.  Entrainment of clean air results in slightly increased Re, reduced albedo, cooling, vertical mixing, entrainment and LWP, and increased inhomogeneity and precipitation.   Precipitation removes liquid water from the cloud, but evapouration of the raindrops then moistens and cools the air below, reducing LWP, vertical mixing and albedo, and increasing cloud layer inhomogeneity.  Furthermore the effects are coupled with increased CCN leading to reduced precipitation, and precipitation removing CCN.\r\n\r\nThe amount of horizontal inhomogeneity in the albedo of the simulated cloud tops over different domain sizes is also examined.  Increasing CCN reduces the inhomogeneity across all domain sizes, while both the entrainment of clean air and precipitation increase the inhomogeneity with the greatest increases over the largest domains.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cook, Peter A.","Connelly, Paul","Dearden, Christopher","Allen, Grant","Hill, Adrian"],"dc:date":"2010-07-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1054026,"sim:weight":0.557812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001433,"sim:weight":0.512404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":864642,"sim:weight":0.492745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24627,"sim:weight":0.486593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":980254,"sim:weight":0.461703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":962541,"sim:weight":0.453681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1054049,"sim:weight":0.451998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001113,"sim:weight":0.444689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001343,"sim:weight":0.439987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29461,"sim:weight":0.41635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9597632,"sim:weight":0.415012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1054038,"sim:weight":0.414494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1096882,"sim:weight":0.401618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002661,"sim:weight":0.395108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":864646,"sim:weight":0.395032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7772,"sim:weight":0.366675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":980255,"sim:weight":0.361665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1141063,"sim:weight":0.358709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1054074,"sim:weight":0.355559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":888967,"sim:weight":0.353557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":6822,"ep:Repository":16,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"MOLES-v3 Information Model","bibo:abstract":"The Metadata Objects for Linking Environmental Sciences (MOLES) model has been  developed within the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) DataGrid project [NERC DataGrid]    to fill a missing part of the ‘metadata spectrum’. It is a framework within which to encode the relationships between the tools used to obtain data, the activities which organised their use, and the datasets produced. MOLES is primarily of use to consumers of data, especially in an interdisciplinary context, to allow them to establish details of provenance, and to compare and contrast such information without recourse to discipline-specific metadata or private communications with the original investigators [Lawrence et al 2009]. MOLES is also of use to the custodians of data, providing an organising paradigm for the data and metadata.\r\n\r\nThe work described in this paper is a high-level view of the structure and content of a recent major revision of MOLES (v3.3) carried out as part of a NERC DataGrid extension project.  The concepts of MOLES v3.3 are rooted in the harmonised ISO model [Harmonised ISO model] - particularly in metadata standards (ISO 19115, ISO 19115-2) and the ‘Observations and Measurements’ conceptual model (ISO 19156). MOLES exploits existing concepts and relationships, and specialises information in these standards.\r\n\r\nA typical sequence of data capturing involves one or more projects under which a number of activities are undertaken, using appropriate tools and methods to produce the datasets. Following this typical sequence, the relevant metadata can be partitioned into the following main sections – helpful in mapping onto the most suitable standards from the ISO 19100 series. \r\n•\tProject section\r\n•\tActivity section (including both observation acquisition and numerical computation)\r\n•\tObservation section (metadata regarding the methods used to obtained the data, the spatial and temporal sampling regime, quality etc.)\r\n•\tObservation collection section\r\n\r\nThe key concepts in MOLES v3.3 are:\r\n\r\na)\tthe result of an observation is defined uniquely from the property (of a feature-of-interest), the sampling-feature (carrying the targeted property values), the procedure used to obtain the result and the time (discrete instant or period) at which the observation takes place.\r\nb)\tan ‘Acquisition’ and a ‘Computation’ can serve as the basis for describing any observation process chain (procedure). The ‘Acquisition’ uses an instrument – sensor or human being – to produce the results and is associated with field trips, flights, cruises etc., whereas the ‘Computation’ class involves specific processing steps. A process chain may consist of any combination of ‘Acquisitions’ and/or ‘Computations’ occurring in parallel or in any order during the data capturing sequence.\r\nc)\tThe results can be organised in collections with significantly more flexibility than if one used the original project alone\r\nd)\tthe structure of individual observation collections may be domain-specific, in general; however we are investigating the use of CSML (Climate Science Modelling Language) for atmospheric data\r\n\r\nThe model has been tested as a desk exercise by constructing object models for scenarios from various disciplines.\r\nReferences \r\nNERC DATAGRID:  http://ndg.nerc.ac.uk\r\nLAWRENCE ET.

The CMIP5 model documentation questionnaire will retrieve information about the details of the models used, how the simulations were carried out, how the simulations conformed to the CMIP5 experiment requirements and details of the hardware used to perform the simulations.  The metadata collected by the CMIP5 questionnaire will allow CMIP5 data to be compared in a scientifically meaningful way.  \r\nThis paper describes the life-cycle of the CMIP5 questionnaire development which starts with relatively unstructured input from domain specialists and ends with formal XML documents that comply with the METAFOR Common Information Model (CIM).   \r\n\r\nEach development step is associated with a specific tool. (1) Mind maps are used to capture information requirements from domain experts and build a controlled vocabulary, (2) a python parser processes the XML files generated by the mind maps,  (3) Django (python) is used to generate the dynamic structure and content of the web based questionnaire from processed xml and the METAFOR CIM, (4) Python parsers ensure that information entered into the CMIP5 questionnaire is output as CIM compliant xml, (5) CIM compliant output allows automatic information capture tools to harvest questionnaire content into databases such as the Earth System Grid (ESG) metadata catalogue.\r\n\r\nThis paper will focus on how Django (python) and XML input files are used to generate the structure and content of the CMIP5 questionnaire.  It will also address how the choice of development tools listed above provided a framework that enabled working scientists (who we would never ordinarily get to interact with UML and XML) to be part the iterative development process and ensure that the CMIP5 model documentation questionnaire reflects what scientists want to know about the models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pascoe, Charlotte L","Lawrence, Bryan","Moine, Marie-Pierre","Ford, Rupert","Devine, Gerry M"],"dc:date":"2010-05-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1441136,"sim:weight":0.81349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6850,"sim:weight":0.715923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495076,"sim:weight":0.506157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27018,"sim:weight":0.320669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733889,"sim:weight":0.261668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.216874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.214628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30820,"sim:weight":0.211449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45717,"sim:weight":0.199251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61040,"sim:weight":0.191475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106936,"sim:weight":0.190247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.186573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.186573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.186573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.186573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.186573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.186573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.186573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.186573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.186573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Even with such capability, the range of different\r\nsecurity technologies available can make interoperability between services and user client tools a challenge.\r\nOPeNDAP is a key data access service in the infrastructure under development to support the CMIP5 (Couple\r\nModel Intercomparison Project Phase 5). The work is being carried out as part of an international collaboration\r\nincluding the US Earth System Grid and Curator projects and the EU funded IS-ENES and Metafor projects.\r\nThis infrastructure will bring together Petabytes of climate model data and associated metadata from over twenty\r\nmodelling centres around the world in a federation with a core archive mirrored at three data centres. A security\r\nsystem is needed to meet the requirements of organisations responsible for model data including the ability to\r\nrestrict data access to registered users, keep them up to date with changes to data and services, audit access and\r\nprotect ﬁnite computing resources. Individual organisations have existing tools and services such as OPeNDAP\r\nwith which users in the climate research community are already familiar. The security system should overlay\r\naccess control in a way which maintains the usability and ease of access to these services. The BADC (British\r\nAtmospheric Data Centre) has been working in collaboration with the Earth System Grid development team and\r\npartner organisations to develop the security architecture. OpenID and MyProxy were selected at an early stage in\r\nthe ESG project to provide single sign-on capability across the federation of participating organisations.\r\nBuilding on the existing OPeNDAP speciﬁcation an architecture based on pluggable server side compo-\r\nnents has been developed at the BADC. These components ﬁlter requests to the service they protect and apply\r\nthe required authentication and authorisation schemes. Filters have been developed for OpenID and SSL client\r\nbased authentication. The latter enabling access with MyProxy issued credentials. By preserving a clear separation\r\nbetween the security and application functionality, multiple authentication technologies may be supported without\r\nthe need for modiﬁcation to the underlying OPeNDAP application.\r\nThe software has been developed in the Python programming language securing the Python based OPeN-\r\nDAP implementation, PyDAP. This utilises the Python WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) speciﬁcation to\r\ncreate distinct security ﬁlter components. Work is also currently underway to develop a parallel Java based ﬁlter\r\nimplementation to secure the THREDDS Data Server. Whilst the ability to apply this ﬂexible approach to the\r\nserver side security layer is important, the development of compatible client software is vital to the take up of these\r\nservices across a wide user base. To date PyDAP and wget based clients have been tested and work is planned to\r\nintegrate the required security interface into the netCDF API. This forms part of ongoing collaboration with the\r\nOPeNDAP user and development community to ensure interoperability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kershaw, Philip","Ananthakrishnan, Rachana","Cinquini, Luca","Lawrence, Bryan","Pascoe, Stephen","Siebenlist, Frank"],"dc:date":"2010-01-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6838,"sim:weight":0.368156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998042,"sim:weight":0.265542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934231,"sim:weight":0.265532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930696,"sim:weight":0.261716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100616,"sim:weight":0.249279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933672,"sim:weight":0.242966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934482,"sim:weight":0.24108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933129,"sim:weight":0.237024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934177,"sim:weight":0.236579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360397,"sim:weight":0.236301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1396979,"sim:weight":0.233903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933614,"sim:weight":0.232522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931434,"sim:weight":0.220663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933440,"sim:weight":0.20507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934366,"sim:weight":0.194009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100397,"sim:weight":0.192335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733888,"sim:weight":0.192327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.190513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929818,"sim:weight":0.190353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733887,"sim:weight":0.189053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the coming months this ﬁgure is set to increase by over one Petabyte through\r\nthe BADC’s role as one of three data centres to host the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5)\r\ncore archive of climate model data. Quite apart from the problem of managing the storage of such large volumes\r\nthere is the challenge of collating the data together from the modelling centres around the world and enabling\r\naccess to these data for the user community.\r\nAn infrastructure to support this is being developed under the US Earth System Grid (ESG) and related\r\nprojects bringing together participating organisations together in a federation. The ESG architecture deﬁnes\r\nGateways, the web interfaces that enable users to access data and data serving applications organised into Data\r\nNodes. The BADC has been working in collaboration with US Earth System Grid team and other partners to\r\ndevelop a security system to restrict access to data. This provides single sign-on via both OpenID and PKI based\r\nmeans and uses role based authorisation facilitated by SAML and OpenID based interfaces for attribute retrieval.\r\nThis presentation will provide an overview of the access control architecture and look at how this has been\r\nimplemented for CEDA.\r\nCEDA has developed an expertise in data access and information services over several years through a\r\nnumber of projects to develop and enhance these capabilities. Participation in CMIP5 comes at a time when a\r\nnumber of other software development activities are coming to fruition. New services are in the process of being\r\ndeployed alongside services making up the system for ESG. The security system must apply access control across\r\nthis heterogeneous environment of different data services and technologies. One strand of the development efforts\r\nwithin CEDA has been the NDG (NERC Datagrid) Security system. This system has been extended to interoperate\r\nwith ESG, greatly assisted by the standards based approach adopted for the ESG security architecture. Drawing\r\nfrom experience from previous projects the decision was taken to refactor the NDG Security software into a\r\ncomponent based architecture to enable a separation of concerns between access control and the functionality of a\r\ngiven application being protected.\r\nSuch an approach is only possible through a generic interface. At CEDA, this has been realised in the\r\nPython programming language using the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) speciﬁcation. A parallel Java\r\nﬁlter based implementation is also under development with our US partners for use with the THREDDS Data\r\nServer. Using such technologies applications and middleware can be assembled into custom conﬁgurations to\r\nmeet different requirements. In the case of access control, NDG Security middleware can be layered over the top\r\nof existing applications without the need to modify them. A RESTful approach to the application of authorisation\r\npolicy has been key in this approach. We explore the practical implementation of such a scheme alongside the\r\napplication of the ESG security architecture to CEDA’s OGC web services implementation COWS.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kershaw, Philip","Lawrence, Bryan","Lowe, Dominic","Norton, Peter","Pascoe, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2010-01-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6834,"sim:weight":0.368156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733888,"sim:weight":0.299063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733889,"sim:weight":0.297842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100616,"sim:weight":0.268627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930696,"sim:weight":0.26117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934231,"sim:weight":0.251244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998042,"sim:weight":0.248287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.233072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43080,"sim:weight":0.228732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.225569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26009,"sim:weight":0.217786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934482,"sim:weight":0.216686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933440,"sim:weight":0.212275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28175,"sim:weight":0.207951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386709,"sim:weight":0.204684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931434,"sim:weight":0.191372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98980,"sim:weight":0.189499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.174911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.161464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.161464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Currently, most long-term\r\nrain rate data sets are hourly (or longer) rain accumulations, so investigating the rain events that occur for less than\r\n0.01% (52.5 minutes) of a year is not possible. Rain datasets do exist with smaller temporal resolution, but these are\r\neither not continuous, or simply have not been in operation long enough to investigate any trends in climate change.\r\n\r\nThe Chilbolton Observatory in the south of England is one of the world’s most advanced meteorological\r\nradar experimental facilities, and is home to the world’s largest fully steerable meteorological radar, the Chilbolton\r\nAdvanced Meteorological Radar (CAMRa). It also hosts a wide range of meteorological and atmospheric sensing\r\ninstruments, including cameras, lidars, radiometers and a wide selection of different types of rain gauges. The UK\r\natmospheric science, hydrology and Earth Observation communities use the instruments located at Chilbolton to\r\nconduct research in weather, flooding and climate. This often involves observations of meteorological phenomena\r\noperating below the current resolution of (forecasting and climate) models and work on their effective parameterisation.\r\n\r\nThe Chilbolton datasets contain a continuous drop counting rain gauge time series at 10 seconds integration\r\ntime, spanning from January 2001 to the present. Though the length of the time series is not sufficient to\r\nconfidently identify any effects of climate change, the time resolution is sufficient to investigate the differences in\r\nthe extreme values of rain events over the nine years of the dataset, characterising the inter-annual and seasonal\r\nvariability. Changes in the occurrence of different rain events have also been investigated by looking at event and\r\ninter-event durations to determine if there is any change in the relative number of stratiform and convective events\r\nover the time period.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of the fine scale variability of rain (both in the spatial and temporal domains) is important for\r\nthe development of accurate models for small-scale forecasting, as well as models for the implementation and\r\noperation of rain affected systems, such as microwave radio communications and flood mitigation. As the rain\r\ngauge measurements made at Chilbolton will continue for the foreseeable future, these datasets will become\r\nincreasingly valuable, as they provide a “ground-truth” that can be compared with the results of climate and other\r\nmodels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Callaghan, SA"],"dc:date":"2010-05-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26258,"sim:weight":0.250918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101611,"sim:weight":0.248573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385621,"sim:weight":0.247847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56584,"sim:weight":0.21564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64032,"sim:weight":0.209001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385594,"sim:weight":0.20452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.203667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.20365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30278,"sim:weight":0.20231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27946,"sim:weight":0.187712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81493,"sim:weight":0.181787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60643,"sim:weight":0.175868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31979,"sim:weight":0.173486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.173255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61637,"sim:weight":0.171123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31900,"sim:weight":0.170149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495076,"sim:weight":0.168889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97628,"sim:weight":0.168139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60630,"sim:weight":0.166538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.163594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Climate modelling is a complex process, which requires accurate and complete metadata\r\n(data describing data) in order to identify, assess and use the climate data stored in digital repositories.\r\n\r\nThe EU funded METAFOR project has developed a Common Information Model (CIM) to describe in a\r\nstandard way climate data and the models and modelling environments that produce this data. To establish the\r\nCIM, METAFOR first considered the metadata models developed by many groups engaged in similar efforts in\r\nEurope and worldwide (for example the US Earth System Curator), explored fragmentation and gaps as well\r\nas duplication of information present in these metadata models, and reviewed current problems in identifying,\r\naccessing or using climate data present in existing repositories. The CIM documents the “simulation context and\r\nmodels”, i.e. the whys and wherefores and issues associated with any particular simulation.\r\n\r\nClimate modelling is a complex process with a wide degree of variability between different models and\r\ndifferent modelling groups. To accommodate this, the CIM has been designed to be highly generic and flexible.\r\nThe climate modelling process which is \"an activity undertaken using software on computers to produce data\" is\r\ndescribed as separate UML packages. This fairly generic structure can be paired with more specific \"controlled\r\nvocabularies\" in order to restrict the range of valid CIM instances.\r\n\r\nMETAFOR has been charged by the Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) via the Coupled\r\nModel Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) panel to define and collect model and experiment metadata for CMIP5.\r\nTo do this, a web-based questionnaire will collect information and metadata from the CMIP5 modelling groups\r\non the details of the models used, how the simulations were carried out, how the models conformed to the specific\r\nCMIP5 experiment requirements. The aim of the questionnaire is to document the climate models in sufficient\r\ndetail so that the CMIP5 data can be located and compared by a wide and diverse community, including those\r\nresearchers with an interest in the impacts and adaptations of climate change (e.g. IPCC’s WGII). A new set\r\nof “controlled vocabulary” was devised to describe in a standard and structured way the dynamics, physics,\r\nnumerical schemes and other parameterisations of the several components (ocean, atmosphere, land surface, sea\r\nice, atmospheric chemistry, etc.) of the earth system models used in CMIP5.\r\n\r\nThe CMIP5 model documentation questionnaire is an ambitious metadata collection tool. It will provide\r\nthe most comprehensive metadata for a climate model inter-comparison project yet and plans for the community\r\ngovernance of its associated standards and now being organised. The questionnaire’s close ties with the CIM will\r\nensure that the metadata for the CMIP5 model runs will be stored in a standard way, enabling the development of\r\ntools to search for and compare CIM documents, and hence different climate models","bibo:AuthorList":["Callaghan, Sarah","Guilyardi, Eric"],"dc:date":"2010-05-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6826,"sim:weight":0.715923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495076,"sim:weight":0.539213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27018,"sim:weight":0.373037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733887,"sim:weight":0.346784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733889,"sim:weight":0.324919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733888,"sim:weight":0.277502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.247228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.233375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.220024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.21908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.21908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.21908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.21908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.21908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.21908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.21908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.21908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.21908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.21908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.21908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It was one of the first Geography Markup Language (GML) application schemas\r\ndescribing complex feature types for the metocean domain. CSML feature types can be used to describe typical\r\nclimate products such as model runs or atmospheric profiles. CSML has been successfully used within NDG\r\nto provide harmonised access to a number of different data sources. For example, meteorological observations\r\nheld in heterogeneous databases by the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) and Centre for Ecology and\r\nHydrology (CEH) were served uniformly as CSML features via Web Feature Service.\r\nCSML has now been substantially revised to harmonise it with the latest developments in OGC and ISO\r\nconceptual modelling for geographic information. In particular, CSML is now aligned with the near-final ISO\r\n19156 Observations \u0026 Measurements (O\u0026M) standard. CSML combines the O\u0026M concept of ’sampling features’\r\ntogether with an observation result based on the coverage model (ISO 19123). This general pattern is specialised\r\nfor particular data types of interest, classified on the basis of sampling geometry and topology.\r\nIn parallel work, the OGC Met Ocean Domain Working Group has established a conceptual modelling ac-\r\ntivity. This is a cross-organisational effort aimed at reaching consensus on a common core data model that could\r\nbe re-used in a number of met-related application areas: operational meteorology, aviation meteorology, climate\r\nstudies, and the research community. It is significant to note that this group has also identified sampling geometry\r\nand topology as a key classification axis for data types.\r\nUsing the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach as adopted by INSPIRE we demonstrate how the\r\nCSML application schema is derived from a formal UML conceptual model based on the ISO TC211 framework.\r\nBy employing MDA tools which map consistently between UML and GML we can treat the formal UML model\r\nas the primary governed artefact and automatically produce the GML schema as a secondary output.\r\nFinally we describe how increased convergence between CSML and Scientific Feature Types in the Unidata\r\nCommmon Data Model may assist with bridging the implementation gap between OGC/ISO services and the\r\nCF-NetCDF binary data management community. This improved agreement at the conceptual (feature type) level\r\nis important to enable better interoperability at the data exchange and service levels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lowe, Dominic","Woolf, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2010-05-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":490739,"sim:weight":0.259066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106936,"sim:weight":0.232461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":490735,"sim:weight":0.229567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512282,"sim:weight":0.195655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1016773,"sim:weight":0.180013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100254,"sim:weight":0.173287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733888,"sim:weight":0.168023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733889,"sim:weight":0.159486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.158267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931097,"sim:weight":0.152406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6759,"sim:weight":0.152086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733887,"sim:weight":0.151305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9630235,"sim:weight":0.150681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360569,"sim:weight":0.142661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58342,"sim:weight":0.13944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64032,"sim:weight":0.13937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512218,"sim:weight":0.139289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84092,"sim:weight":0.139107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495076,"sim:weight":0.137004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1053942,"sim:weight":0.136946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":7762,"ep:Repository":16,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"A Cyclone Database - Project Report","bibo:abstract":"Accurate prediction of severe weather events is a key Met Office goal. As cyclonic systems are responsible for the\r\nvast majority of these events, accurate cyclone prediction is also high priority. Although huge strides have been made in numerical weather prediction (NWP) in recent years, cyclonic systems continue to pose problems for numerical models. Three ‘exceptional’ depressions in the Christmas periods of 1997 and 1999, and another in early December 1999 were all poorly forecast by most of the world’s operational models, indicating that there is plenty of scope for improvement.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for constructing a cyclone database (previously called the ‘Frontal Wave Database’) is described in detail in Hewson (1998b). The main motivation was the identification and representation of systematic model biases in new formats which, from most practical perspectives, represent a notable improvement on more traditional r.m.s. errorbased statistics. Several other possible uses have arisen in the intervening period; these are detailed at the end of this report.\r\n\r\nEvidently improved knowledge of cyclone forecast characteristics will be valuable not only to the NWP community, but also to forecasting, in part because operational practice now involves using ‘Field Modification’ software to prepare forecast charts (Carroll, 1997), which can be used to correct for known biases.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this report is to describe changes to the project since Hewson (1998b) (section 1.1), to outline the\r\nprocessing stages used to update the database (section 1.2), to describe database structure and list the current set of\r\nstored diagnostics (section 2), to pinpoint major problems encountered during the project (section 3), and indeed overall to provide sufficient information for interested parties to comprehend what the database includes and how it can be utilised. Figures from a limited initial analysis of the data are presented in section 4, followed by conclusions (section 5) and proposals describing the possible areas for future work (section 6).","bibo:AuthorList":["Hewson, Tim D."],"dc:date":"2001-01-30","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E B Carroll.

Despite this, the system continues to pose a tough challenge for General Circulation Models (GCMs) to simulate realistically given the many physical processes involved, and given the multitude of spatio-temporal scales that they act over.\r\n\r\nFor the West African population, any intra-seasonal rainfall variability impacts severely on the local agricultural and water resources, with equally severe consequences on health. This is especially true for the population living in the semi-arid Sahel region which  endures the full impact of the AEJ-AEW system. Improved skilful prediction of the monsoon rains over longer time-scales would be of enormous benefit, aiding in the mitigation of high impact situations events such as the flooding during the summer of 2007, and the drought conditions of the last few decades.\r\n\r\nHere, the African Easterly jet - Easterly wave (AEJ-AEW) system was explored in an idealised model. Prescribed zonally symmetric surface temperature and moisture profiles determine the AEJ which becomes established through meridional contrasts in dry and moist convection.\r\n\r\nImportantly, moist AEWs were characterized by intermittent periods of growth and decay, with growth preceded by increased mean rainfall and later, weakening AEJs. These dependencies established an internal 8-10 day variability, consistent with intra-seasonal observations of 9-day rainy sequences. The observed 8-10 day cycle of rainy sequences related to the natural life cycle of the moist AEW and its interaction with the AEJ, the upper levels and the precipitation. This is a significant result from the moist life cycle as it offers a new view of the moist AEW life cycle and provides an alternative explanation for the observed intra-seasonal variability of the precipitation over NW Africa.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cornforth, Rosalind J","Hoskins, Brian J","Thorncroft, Chris D"],"dc:date":"2009-06-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":7765,"sim:weight":0.482148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711834,"sim:weight":0.209596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.19295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63761,"sim:weight":0.188918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29018,"sim:weight":0.188918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31919,"sim:weight":0.161715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31910,"sim:weight":0.160083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31959,"sim:weight":0.146719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30696,"sim:weight":0.145274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55977,"sim:weight":0.137586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107325,"sim:weight":0.136746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.132351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.128549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31933,"sim:weight":0.126858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31922,"sim:weight":0.125996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27946,"sim:weight":0.124438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27259,"sim:weight":0.116666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31937,"sim:weight":0.115759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27536,"sim:weight":0.115203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002000,"sim:weight":0.114748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Tropical cyclone sensitivity has also been assessed. There is now considerable interest in its application for singular vector computation in the tropics and tropical perturbations for the ensemble system on a wider basis than targeting tropical cyclones. Extending this approach to more general tropical weather systems, MSVs are evaluated here for understanding and predicting African easterly waves (AEWs). These are arguably, the tropical systems that exhibit dynamical organization in a manner that is most similar to extra-tropical weather systems, and yet provide the context for convection that is of great importance both in their development and their subsequent behaviour, in their impact on society and in yielding ideas on the interaction between physics and dynamics in the tropical atmosphere that may have more general relevance. \r\n\r\nThe systematic errors that can plague the forecast skill in this region may be improved by process studies aimed at understanding the fundamental dynamics governing the WAM. Here we present first results from a study that aims to use MSVs to build on our recently gained theoretical insights from normal mode studies of the moist AEJ-AEW system, and to learn for practical purposes, whether MSVs targeted on W. Africa could be suitable as perturbations to the ECMWF ensemble system for improving AEW prediction and associated rainfall. First results, without initial moisture perturbations, suggest MSVs may be used advantageously. Perturbations bear similar structural and energy profiles to previous idealised non-linear studies and observations. Strong sensitivities prevail in the metrics and trajectories chosen. The benefits of including initial moisture perturbations are appraised in the light of these findings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cornforth, Rosalind J","Hoskins, Brian J"],"dc:date":"2009-06-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":7764,"sim:weight":0.482148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711834,"sim:weight":0.244331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29018,"sim:weight":0.242462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63761,"sim:weight":0.242462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.204738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31919,"sim:weight":0.189591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.182763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31933,"sim:weight":0.181654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002000,"sim:weight":0.181205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.180472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55977,"sim:weight":0.179042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31921,"sim:weight":0.178203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27946,"sim:weight":0.176375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31910,"sim:weight":0.173329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27259,"sim:weight":0.164977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31922,"sim:weight":0.164626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002861,"sim:weight":0.162532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107325,"sim:weight":0.158502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.157736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31959,"sim:weight":0.156352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The UM predicted distribution of tracer is compared with observations from the ETEX campaign and predictions from the UK Met Office operational air quality forecast model (NAME). The dominant meteorological process is a warm conveyor belt which transports large amounts of tracer away from the surface up to a height of 4km over a 36 hour period. Convection is also an important process, transporting tracer to heights of up to 8km\r\n \r\nPotential sources of error when using an operational numerical weather prediction model to forecast air quality are also investigated.  These potential sources of error include model dynamics, model resolution and model physics. In the UM a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme is used with polynomial interpolation.  This can result in unrealistic negative values of tracer which, when combined with a positive definite scheme in which negative values of tracer are set to zero, results in a failure of the model to conserve tracer mass.  This problem occurs where sharp gradients of tracer concentration exist, such as are found close to source locations and leads to an overprediction of tracer concentrations.  Model resolution can also affect the accuracy of predicted tracer distributions.  Low resolution simulations (50km grid length) were unable to resolve a change in wind direction associated with the cold front, this led to an error in the transport direction and hence an  error in tracer distribution.  High resolution simulations (12km grid length) captured the change in wind direction and hence produced a tracer distribution that compared better with the observations.  The representation of convective mixing was found to have a large affect on the vertical transport of tracer. Turning off the convective mixing parameterisation in the UM significantly reduced the vertical transport of tracer. Finally, air quality forecasts were found to be sensitive to the timing of synoptic scale features.  Errors in the position of the cold front relative to the tracer release location of only 1 hour resulted in changes in the predicted tracer concentrations that were of the same order of magnitude as the absolute tracer concentrations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dacre, Helen"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":661087,"sim:weight":0.185384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43343,"sim:weight":0.184214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14561,"sim:weight":0.174951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.172634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98553,"sim:weight":0.170961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98551,"sim:weight":0.170735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61291,"sim:weight":0.167362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98555,"sim:weight":0.166461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":998847,"sim:weight":0.164996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001020,"sim:weight":0.162875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27356,"sim:weight":0.160926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":486151,"sim:weight":0.160309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12642,"sim:weight":0.156492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29461,"sim:weight":0.153496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1141054,"sim:weight":0.148417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7901,"sim:weight":0.146019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31900,"sim:weight":0.142759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9629955,"sim:weight":0.141136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":864742,"sim:weight":0.138729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77306,"sim:weight":0.13557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its aim was to advance the quality of forecasts of orographically induced convective precipitation by 4D observations and modelling.  From the 13th June to the 16th August 2007, the Universities’ Facility for Atmospheric Measurement (UFAM) 1.5 micron scanning Doppler lidar, operated by the University of Salford, was deployed at Achern, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, in order to take part in the extensive COPS observation campaign.  The University of Salford lidar system measures radial wind and aerosol backscatter from 105 m above the surface to the top of the boundary layer.  Profiles of horizontal wind velocity are shown; these being derived from performing azimuth scans of 5 minute duration, approximately every 30 minutes.  Between azimuth scans, the lidar pointed vertically.  Profiles of vertical velocity, its variance and skewness are also shown.  Knowledge of vertical velocity skewness is important as it can help understand the structure and origin of turbulent convection in the boundary layer.  The skewness of vertical velocity can provide a measure of the asymmetry in the distribution of vertical velocity perturbations within the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).  In previous studies, under fair-weather conditions, when the ABL is heated from below, skewness profile tends to be positive throughout the ABL, while under cloudy conditions, the skewness profile can be affected by cloud processes and therefore predominantly negative.  The behaviour of the boundary layer is investigated using data from the Salford University Doppler lidar, microwave radiometer and automatic weather station.

Statistical coherence of precipitation simulations is even more important in the context of aggregate flood risk and corresponding extreme\r\neconomic losses because these are result of the interplay between local intensities, spatial clustering and areal coverage of precipitation footprints. This interplay is further complicated by the fact that rainfall fields are spatially heterogeneous and non-stationary when considered at short time scales. The purpose of this presentation is to introduce a novel modeling approach to large scale - high resolution precipitation simulations which is computationally feasible for thousands annual realizations under the current climate conditions. The model preserves the rainfall patterns at large scales and incorporates anisotropic downscaling localized in space and time to preserve the non-stationary nature of the local precipitation variability. The entire simulation process is conducted in the domain of a Gaussian copula in order to deal with the inherent spatial heterogeneity of rainfall fields.","bibo:AuthorList":["Qu, Yizhong"],"dc:date":"2009-08-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":666332,"sim:weight":0.425708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001869,"sim:weight":0.414464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97628,"sim:weight":0.393423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81493,"sim:weight":0.374493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63205,"sim:weight":0.370185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385621,"sim:weight":0.362411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26258,"sim:weight":0.352307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10930,"sim:weight":0.345024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56584,"sim:weight":0.338584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52847,"sim:weight":0.326302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64032,"sim:weight":0.296869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52843,"sim:weight":0.295791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52836,"sim:weight":0.283084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":777875,"sim:weight":0.281663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61740,"sim:weight":0.280283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385690,"sim:weight":0.260649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":731990,"sim:weight":0.258973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75564,"sim:weight":0.256438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60643,"sim:weight":0.252201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64013,"sim:weight":0.249224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The strength of α is inversely related to the ENSO amplitude in the models and the latent heat and shortwave flux components of this feedback dominate.

There is, therefore, an opportunity to contribute significantly to this area of meteorology - this is the goal of this work. The context for this paper is the Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study (COPS). The COPS observational campaign, which was undertaken in 2007, was based around the Black Forest region with the aim of improving precipitation forecasts in low mountainous regions. However, the project also represents a great data archive with which to analyse isolated features, such as atmospheric lids. In short, lids play a vital role in the development of convective storms. For example, evidence from the Convective Storm Initiation Project (CSIP), which was run in the UK in 2005, has shown that lids are important not only in determining whether a storm occurs but also when and where they develop and how intense they are – sometimes, counterintuitively, they appear to increase the intensity. This extended abstract is intended as a brief overview of the previous literature on lids in order to place the work presented at ICAM-2009 in the wider scientific context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Russell, Andrew","Vaughan, Geraint"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L J Bennett, A M Blyth, K A Browning and E G Norton.

Intensive Observations Period (IOP) 9c 20th July, \u0026 aimed to observe the development \u0026 modification of a Mesoscale Convective System (MCS), which had convection embedded within its frontal zone, as it passed over the COPS region from south-west to north-east.\r\n\r\nA gust front, emanating from MCS outflow, together with orographic lifting \u0026 a thermally-driven convergence line combined to generate an arc of severe convective activity east of the COPS region \u0026 ahead of the MCS.  In-situ \u0026 remote sensing surface observations show that the complex COPS orography significantly modified the shape, structure \u0026 path of the gust front.  This, in turn, locally enhanced the pre-frontal convergence zone, eventually leading to convective initiation.\r\n\r\nThis paper will discuss the way in which the MCS gust front became decoupled from the synoptic flow aloft.  Observations show substantial differences in the magnitude \u0026 direction of the gust front between sites located on mountain tops \u0026 those located in valleys.  Differences between valley sites are also identified depending on the valley orientation.  Valleys aligned perpendicular to the synoptic-scale MCS track appear to be sheltered from the gust front by steep valley gradients.  Valleys in the eastern COPS region that are roughly aligned parallel to the MCS track, appear to organise the path of the gust front out of the Black Forest \u0026 into the regions of strong convergence where the convective cells subsequently form.  Flow features are explained \u0026 further analysed by comparison with high resolution simulations of the IOP using the Weather Research \u0026 Forecasting numerical model (WRF).","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, VH","Mobbs, SD","Burton, RR"],"dc:date":"2009-07-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":666279,"sim:weight":0.400343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104470,"sim:weight":0.387645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":888781,"sim:weight":0.319047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31922,"sim:weight":0.251269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27946,"sim:weight":0.196711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43343,"sim:weight":0.17631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26258,"sim:weight":0.175844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31900,"sim:weight":0.162432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64032,"sim:weight":0.155826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27536,"sim:weight":0.152633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":819706,"sim:weight":0.145256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":864606,"sim:weight":0.14473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27259,"sim:weight":0.144506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.144037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.144037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61637,"sim:weight":0.142408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.142048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31910,"sim:weight":0.141734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931226,"sim:weight":0.13963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61291,"sim:weight":0.139053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aims of the campaign were: (a) to gain experience in the collection and use of field data to validate radiance and reflectance products from airborne and satellite sensors; (b) to share best practice on the validation of leaf-area index (LAI) estimates derived from satellite sensor data; and (c) to assemble a quality controlled, multi-scale, multi-sensor data set for algorithm development and testing. Data specifically to support the campaign experiments were acquired by CHRIS/Proba, SPOT and three satellites in the DMC constellation. Three aircraft fitted with hyperspectral sensors, LiDAR and high performance digital survey cameras were flown over the test area. Several field teams\r\nmade measurements on the ground, and many data sets were acquired nearsimultaneously so as to allow direct inter-comparison. The data may be accessed via the NERC EO Data Centre and potential uses are many and varied, including research, education and training on the physical basis of remote sensing (e.g. sensor and instrument\r\ncalibration); image understanding (e.g. up- and down-scaling); and remote sensing applications (e.g. land cover mapping, forest survey, river habitat survey, LAI estimation, policy-related issues).","bibo:AuthorList":["Milton, EJ"],"dc:date":"2008-09-17","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"DEFRA.

Height-resolved ozone distributions spanning the troposphere and stratosphere between 50N and 80S have been retrieved from two orbits of data crossing the east Pacific and north America on 11th January 1996. The height vs latitude cross-section over the E.Pacific is in broad agreement with the troposphere / lower stratosphere distribution calculated for January by a zonally-averaged (2-D) chemical-transport model. A large enhancement to tropospheric ozone is detected by GOME over southern California, which we assume to be due to local photochemical production. Support for the major features seen in the two GOME cross-sections is provided by intercomparison of retrieved profiles with 19 co-located ozonesondes. The standard deviation in fractional difference is \u003c10% in the stratosphere and \u003c30% in the troposphere, and the bias is \u003c5% above 6km and -25% below 6km (possibly due to cloud contamination).","bibo:AuthorList":["Siddans, Richard","Reburn, WJ","Kerridge, B","Munro, R"],"dc:date":"2007-04-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K Chance and R Spurr.

Unlike ice cores, firn extraction yields large volumes (tens of litres) of air for analysis. This allows samples to be circulated between laboratories for repeated analysis of different suites of trace gases at ultra-trace levels. This will enable a detailed picture of the atmospheric composition to be built up in air of different ages. Extensive modelling studies will then be conducted to determine the trends of short-lived reactive species such as ozone, hydroxyl radical, peroxide, formaldehyde, and reactive oxides of nitrogen. Hence we will determine the extent of human impact on the trace gas composition and photooxidant chemistry of the troposphere.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sturges, WT"],"dc:date":"2002-12-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9001699,"sim:weight":0.615745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501348,"sim:weight":0.548639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62630,"sim:weight":0.321378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.291694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.291694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.254932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146003,"sim:weight":0.236211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.234381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its biochemical precursor is dimethylsulfoniopropionate\r\n(DMSP), a globally distributed, intracellular constituent in marine phytoplankton. During a multidisciplinary\r\nLagrangian experiment in the subpolar North Atlantic, we determined the fluxes of DMSP and DMS through\r\nphytoplankton, microzooplankton, and bacterioplankton and compared them with concurrent carbon and sulfur fluxes\r\nthrough primary and secondary productions, grazing, and release and use of dissolved organic matter. We found\r\nthat DMSP and derivatives contributed most (48–100%) of the sulfur fluxes and 5–15% of the carbon fluxes. Our\r\nfindings highlight DMSP as a prominent player in pelagic biogeochemical pumps, especially as a major carrier in\r\norganic sulfur cycling. Also, our results illustrate the key role played by microzooplankton and heterotrophic bacteria\r\n(hence the microbial food web) in controlling the amount of phytoplanktonic DMSP that ultimately vents to the\r\natmosphere in the form of DMS.","bibo:AuthorList":["Simo, Rafael","Archer, Stephen D","Pedro´s-Alio, Carlos","Gilpin, Linda","Stelfox-Widdicombe, Claire E"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M O ANDREAE and P J CRUTZEN.

PIMMS uses the Metafor methodology for simulation documentation which consists of a common information model (CIM), a set of controlled vocabularies (CV) and software tools. PIMMS software tools provide for the creation and consumption of CIM content via a web infrastructure and portal.PIMMS will refactor the “CMIP5 questionnaire” metadata management tool, that is collecting climate model metadata for the CMIP5 model inter-comparison project, so that it can be more easily portable into stand alone installations within the university environment and customised to address the specific requirements of individual research groups. Initial model descriptions may take time to complete but once they have been cre ated the PIMMS infrastructure can be used to document subsequent variations by describing only those elements that are changed. An established PIMMS infrastructure will fit seamlessly into the research metadata workflow and significantly reduce subsequent documentation effort.  The key to the customisation of PIMMS is in the modularity of its tools and the clear separation of structure (CIM) from content (CV). The PIMMS project will extend the CMIP5 controlled vocabulary to encompass descriptions of paleoclimate models and will also demonstrate how the CIM can be used to document an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM). This proof of concept prototype will create a new controlled vocabulary in collaboration with Ermitage and use it to reconfigure PIMMS to collect metadata in a different discipline. PIMMS will further explore how the CV that is used to configure PIMMS may be of further use to our stake holders and the wider JISC community through the development of the Uni versity of Cambridge chemicaltagger tool.  PIMMS will provide a local portal so that research groups can view and search their own content, as well as publish their metadata content to institutional, national and international services. In addition PIMMS will also include data node software so that data documented with PIMMS can also be published to the web, both locally, and to national and international services.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pascoe, Charlotte L","Devine, Gerry M"],"dc:date":"2011-12-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6826,"sim:weight":0.81349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The process began with administrative functions (in 2005) and has proceeded steadily since, as new activities have and continue to be accreted into CEDA. Until 2008, the constituent parts of CEDA reported independently to NERC, but in 2009 we produced the first public report for CEDA. We are pleased to present here in our second annual report, evidence of the range of activities undertaken in CEDA, from methodical management of data, through innovative software development, to a close engagement with the scientific community – gathering and delivering the requirements of 21st century digital environmental science.\r\n\r\nDigital curation involves ensuring that data remains both safe and fit for purpose. For most of us it is intangible, we\u0027re not really aware of it except for when things go wrong. We have considerable experience of personal curation failings: we all know someone (or have had it happen to us) who has suffered a hard-drive failure, but just as important is recognising the inability to understand the contents of a spreadsheet we created a few months ago as a curation failure resulting in unneeded angst and repetition of effort. Hopefully, we have less experience of service curation failure, even as we rely on remotely managed data (some of which we create, some of which we consume). From banks to insurance companies, from facebook to flickr, as our world of digital data expands, so too does our dependency. All service providers carry out curation; a delicate balancing act between preserving the bits and bytes, and evolving the way those bits and bytes are stored and understood to support new products and services. So too in science, the journal article is no longer the only important product of science – more and more of the underlying data is being preserved both as evidence for what was done, and as raw material for new and interesting syntheses of information. Digital curation is now part and parcel of doing science, ensuring we understand what was done and can repeat it, even as we have forgotten the doing of it.\r\n\r\nCEDA plays its part in curation and evolution by endeavouring to preserve for posterity what has been done and facilitating new and interesting ways of exploiting data for the future. Such facilitation now includes both building new delivery services (which is what the users see) and new information services to ensure the data is always fit for purpose and available for reuse (the hard part of which most users never see). It also includes acquiring third party data as necessary and engaging with producers and users\r\nof data alike. In this, the second annual report of CEDA, we present some of our curation and facilitation accomplishments from the last year, beginning with a summary of important events and collaborations. We follow that with some selected highlights, and some statistical reports, including a financial summary. We then present our targets for next year. CEDA has done much, well, and of necessity; only some of what we have done is presented here, and we trust that you find something of interest.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lawrence, Bryan N"],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6759,"sim:weight":0.656375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6781,"sim:weight":0.386976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6189627,"sim:weight":0.381779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6838,"sim:weight":0.299063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100254,"sim:weight":0.287092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6830,"sim:weight":0.281086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6850,"sim:weight":0.277502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100571,"sim:weight":0.274698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52148,"sim:weight":0.262844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100161,"sim:weight":0.243309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2811550,"sim:weight":0.233699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6860,"sim:weight":0.22626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6822,"sim:weight":0.211955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6777,"sim:weight":0.206975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100574,"sim:weight":0.193246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6834,"sim:weight":0.192327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6854,"sim:weight":0.168023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100608,"sim:weight":0.161004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

CEDA was established by the amalgamation of the activities of two of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) designated data centres: the British Atmospheric Data Centre, and the NERC Earth Observation Data Centre. The process began with administrative functions (in 2005) and has proceeded steadily since, as new activities have and continue to be accreted into CEDA. Until 2008, the constituent parts of CEDA reported independently to NERC, but in 2009 we produced the first public report for CEDA. We are pleased to present here our third annual report, covering activities for the “2010” year (actually from April 2010 to the end of March 2011). The report\r\nitself is in two sections, the first broadly providing a summary of activities and some statistics with some short descriptions of some significant activities, and new this year, a second section introducing some of the staff, and what they do from day-to-day. (Note that although the UK solar system data centre joined CEDA in this year, we have yet to include significant reporting from that activity.) \r\n\r\nCEDA staff are involved in nearly all the major atmospheric science programmes under way in the UK, in many earth observation programmes, and in a wide range of informatics activities. The CEDA involvement in informatics is main targeted at achieving three main objectives: (1) Providing suitable tools to document and manage both high volume and highly heterogeneous data both in CEDA and the\r\ncommunity; (2) Delivering tooling and services to enable the community to exploit CEDA data holdings, and; (3) Improving the ability of fundamental standards both to improve the likelihood that others can build standards compliant software we can deploy, and to support interdisciplinary science. \r\n\r\nWhile all of these activities are of course aimed squarely at supporting the UK community, of necessity, and like the science programmes in which we work, we could not complete our objectives without both building on and contributing to other activities – both in the UK and abroad. In particular we rely on partnerships we have built with other organisations so that we can leverage the informatics investments elsewhere to deliver solutions to the three objectives above. One of our closest partnerships is with the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ), but we have strong connections with a range of other institutions, particularly those within the Global Organisation for Earth System Science Portals (GOESSP, see http://go-essp.gfdl.noaa.gov). Other important relationships include with the Met Office, our sister data centres in the Natural Environment Research Council community, and the European space data community (in particular the European Space Agency).\r\n\r\nIn the report that follows it will be seen that many of our activities involve partners from the list above delivering solutions in support of our two main scientific communities: the UK atmospheric and earth observation communities. In 2010 these communities delivered two especially major challenges to CEDA, challenges which are likely to be with us for some years: firstly, how to acquire, document, distribute, and support the massive amounts of data being produced by international model intercomparison projects (and in particular, CMIP5); and secondly, how to develop a strong engagement with the new International Space Innovation Centre sharing our site at Harwell. Clearly ISIC provides us with a vehicle which could greatly strengthen our ability for the data collected by the UK academic community to make greater commercial and scientific impacts. Our highlights section indicates some of the activities we have begun in support of these two challenges, and we might expect to see much more on these in future years.\r\n\r\nI trust that whatever your background, you can find something of interest in the material presented here.\r\nBryan Lawrence, Director","bibo:AuthorList":["Lawrence, Bryan N"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6759,"sim:weight":0.676614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107215,"sim:weight":0.473759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6189627,"sim:weight":0.378942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6781,"sim:weight":0.377243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100400,"sim:weight":0.372919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9548370,"sim:weight":0.354368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6850,"sim:weight":0.324919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5576,"sim:weight":0.298211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6838,"sim:weight":0.297842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931014,"sim:weight":0.284254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6842,"sim:weight":0.278884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6880,"sim:weight":0.273651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52148,"sim:weight":0.270711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6826,"sim:weight":0.261668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2808531,"sim:weight":0.257137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100161,"sim:weight":0.256684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8793846,"sim:weight":0.253566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100571,"sim:weight":0.248827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6830,"sim:weight":0.24767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100254,"sim:weight":0.245958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

JASMIN and CEMS will share some hardware.\r\nIn this presentation, we concentrate on JASMIN, which will consist of multi-Petabyte fast reliable storage and co-located data analysis compute at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, with satellite installations at Reading, Leeds and Bristol Universities.

Disciplines using Geographic Information (GI) in particular are those\r\nwithin the earth and physical sciences, and increasingly those within social science and medical fields. Therefore geographic datasets are increasingly being shared, exchanged and frequently re-purposed\r\nfor uses beynd their original intended use.\r\nThe ISO Technical Committee 211 (ISO/TC 211) together with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provide a series of standards and guidelines for developing application schemas which should:\r\na) capture relevant conceptual aspects of the data involved;\r\nb) be sufficient to satisfy previously defined use-cases of a specific or cross-domain concerns.\r\nIn addition, the HollowWorld technology offers an accessible and industry-standardised methodology for creating and editing Application Schema UML models which conform to international standards for\r\ninteroperable GI [2]. We present a technology which seamlessly transforms an Application Schema UML model to a relational database model (RDBM). This technology, using the same UML information\r\nmodel, complements the XML transformation of an information model produced by the FullMoon tool [2].\r\nRDBMs exist to enable searching within a data collection, a process that has, over the decades, been heavily optimized. Moreover, modern non-relational DB [3] flavours (MongoDB, Cassandra,\r\nNewSQL) are still in their infancy with associated disadvantages for ease of adoption, software reliability, etc. A UML schema, or better its XMI description, has, in contrast, an almost natural\r\nmapping/transformation to an XSD schema and ISO19136 with well known applications, e.g. Fullmoon or Shape Change, supporting this approach. However, describing geographic information within a\r\nwidely accepted XML-encoded vendor-neutral format such as GML may not be the best option for persisting or searching operations.\r\nWithin a full model-driven approach the UML should remain at the centre of any implementation claiming to represent the model itself. In this context, a UML -\u003e XSD -\u003e RDBM transformation is not\r\npossible because the both the XSD and RDBM, and even an OWL implementation, have the same goal: to represent the same model. In a typical scenario an ingested XML document is separated into core\r\nand ancillary data: the core data map to a set of relational tables, the ancillary to a single XML-type field. This approach works well when the core data are a fraction of the whole document, and even better\r\nif the main aim of the RDBM is not to simply return other XML objects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nagni, Maurizio","Ventouras, Spiros","Parton, Graham A"],"dc:date":"2012-04-23","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"ISO.

Two datasets are published on the BADC website: attenuated lidar backscatter coefficient and humidity mixing ratio. The attenuated backscatter coefficient is measured using the elastically scattered radiation. At this wavelength, elastically scattered light from both molecules and aerosols is detected. The humidity mixing ratio is measured using the much weaker Raman (inelastically) scattered light from water vapour and nitrogen molecules. Currently the temperature measurements are under development and data are not published.","bibo:AuthorList":["Agnew, J"],"dc:date":"2003-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This is thought to have caused the temperature increase observed in the records, which make the Western Antarctic Peninsula one of the fastest warming regions on Earth. Recently performed comprehensive analyses of synoptic observations of cloud parameters recorded at the Antarctic base Faraday/ Vernadsky for the period 1960 to 2005 have shown that one effect of the warming is a significant increase in the annual mean of the total cloud cover. The strongest and most significant positive seasonal trend was found in winter, but positive tendencies are observable in all seasons.  A direct consequence of these changes is an increase in the number of days on which some form of precipitation is recorded.  In combination with the rising air temperatures this leads to significant changes in the phase of the observed precipitation. The number of non-frozen precipitation events has increased by 2.4 events per year. Though the highest seasonal trend is observed in summer (1.2 events per year), the increases in spring and autumn will probably have the most impact.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kirchgaessner, AC"],"dc:date":"2009-06-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26258,"sim:weight":0.2832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.242841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85124,"sim:weight":0.234699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This predictability is primarily associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). But is climate predictable further ahead? To what extent does knowledge of initial conditions constrain longer-term climate forecasts?\r\n\r\nIn this study we investigate whether there is evidence that climate variables are potentially predictable beyond the generally accepted limit of ENSO predictability. Recognising that predictability is likely to be dependent on initial conditions we consider model-based case studies rather than measures of average predictability.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere-ocean coupled Hadley Centre HadCM3 model was used in this work. Starting from a pre-indstrial state, a single run was integrated with observed changes in greenhouse gases, volcanic aerosols and the solar cycle for the period 1860-1950. Still using observed forcings, an ensemble of five members was started from the 1950 state and integrated for another 50 years. Each case study consists of two further ensembles started with contemporaneous intial conditions from two different members of the five member ensemble. Four case studies have been completed using ensemble members with opposing large, persistent, regional differences in sea surface temperatures and ocean heat content.\r\n\r\nThe results show clear evidence that knowledge of initial conditions can constrain predictions of climate variables beyond ENSO predictability. In the particular case studies considered, the aspects of climate that are predictable include North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, western European and southeastern US 1.5m temperatures, tropical and subtropical precipitation inthe Pacific and tropical precipitation in the Atlantic. However, predictability of climate variables is strongly dependent on the initial conditions.\r\n\r\nWhat are the mechanisms that give rise to these predictable signals? In most cases it seems to be simple persistence of ocean heat content anomalies, but there is also evidence of other mechanisms including ocean dynamics and ocean-atmosphere interaction. We are carrying out further work to interpret and clarify these mechanisms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hermanson, Leon","Sutton, Rowan"],"dc:date":"2008-12-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8826661,"sim:weight":0.502556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26554,"sim:weight":0.404457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7800,"sim:weight":0.375178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Therefore sea-ice predictions are important for accurate\r\ninter-annual to decadal prediction of climate in coupled climate models. However, to our\r\nknowledge there has been little work on how predictable sea-ice is in a coupled\r\natmosphere-ocean-ice model. We have studied the predictability of sea-ice in HadCM3 using\r\ncase study ensemble experiments with external forcing from the late 20th century designed to emphasize\r\nthe predictability in the climate system due to initial conditions. Here, we will concentrate\r\non spring (maximum) ice-volume in a box in the Greenland Sea (30W to 10E, 68N to 80N). Model\r\nclimatology from a control-run shows that this region has high inter-annual variability in\r\nsea-ice volume. We find that although ice may almost completely disappear from this area in\r\nlate autumn, the same anomalies re-appear in the following spring for at least the first four years\r\nin three out of four case studies. The mechanism for this appears to be related to persistence of\r\nocean heat content in the initial conditions and the state of the meridional overturning circulation\r\nand its associated heat transport. In this model, the atmosphere appears to less important than the\r\nocean in determining the predictability of sea-ice volume in the Greenland Sea.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hermanson, Leon","Sutton, Rowan","Keeley, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2009-11-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":7796,"sim:weight":0.439253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7800,"sim:weight":0.325375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.31958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":6104821,"ep:Repository":16,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Mars Analysis Correction Data Assimilation: A Multi-Annual Reanalysis of Atmospheric Observations for the Red Planet","bibo:abstract":"Ever-increasing numbers of atmospheric observations from orbiting spacecraft, and increasingly\r\nsophisticated numerical atmospheric models, have recently permitted data assimilation\r\ntechniques to be applied to planets beyond the Earth. Mars is the first extra-terrestrial planet for\r\nwhich reanalyses of the atmospheric state are now available.\r\n\r\nThe Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on board NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) has\r\nproduced an extensive atmospheric data set during its scientific mapping phase between 1999\r\nand 2004. Nadir thermal profiles for the atmosphere below about 40 km altitude, and total dust\r\nand water ice opacities, have been retrieved from TES spectra, covering almost three complete\r\nMartian seasonal cycles (each seasonal cycle on Mars corresponds to 668.6 mean solar days,\r\nand the Martian mean solar day is about 24 hours and 40 minutes). Note that dust on Mars plays\r\na key role in the weather and climate, mainly through its strong absorption of short wave radiation\r\nwith a short radiative relaxation timescale of 1-2 days. Assimilating dust opacities correctly is,\r\ntherefore, particularly important for atmospheric data assimilation on the Red Planet.\r\n\r\nTES retrieved observations have been analysed by assimilation into a Mars general circulation\r\nmodel (MGCM), making use of a sequential procedure known as the Analysis Correction scheme,\r\na form of successive corrections method which has proved simple and robust under Martian\r\nconditions, even during the less-than-ideal MGS aerobraking period. The MGCM used at the\r\nUniversity of Oxford and at The Open University consists of a spectral dynamical solver and a\r\ntracer transport scheme developed in the UK. Its package of state-of-the-art physical\r\nparameterization routines is shared with the LMD-MarsGCM, developed by the Laboratoire de\r\nMétéorologie Dynamique in Paris (France).\r\n\r\nOne limitation of TES is that relatively few limb profiles are available, compared to nadir\r\nsoundings. Our MGS/TES reanalysis, therefore, does not include observations of temperature\r\nabove about 40 km altitude, nor 3D information on dust opacity (the vertical distribution of dust\r\nopacity is prescribed assuming a well mixed dust layer with a rapid transition to a clear upper\r\natmosphere at a height which depends on latitude and season.\r\n\r\nIn September 2006 NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) started its mapping phase. The\r\nMars Climate Sounder (MCS) on board MRO is a radiometer with eight mid- and far-infrared\r\nchannels and one visible channel, which takes measurements in limb and off-nadir geometries.\r\nRetrieved vertical profiles of temperature, dust and water ice opacities from MCS observations\r\ncan now be assimilated using the same scheme we used for TES, with the advantage of the\r\nextension in altitude (thermal profiles can extend to above 80 km altitude, although errors become\r\nlarger at greater altitudes), the increased vertical resolution (~ 5km compared to \u003e 10km for TES\r\nnadir retrievals), and the direct information on the vertical distribution of dust and water ice.\r\n\r\nOverall, the application of our data assimilation scheme to retrieved observations from TES and\r\nMCS spans almost six complete Martian seasonal cycles. This represents a multi-annual\r\nclimatology for Mars, which has the advantage of being a complete, dynamically-balanced, fourdimensional\r\nbest-fit to observations for all the atmospheric variables, including those for which no\r\ndirect measurements are available (e.g. wind and surface pressure) and with regions of no\r\nobservations filled-in in a physically-consistent way.\r\n\r\nThe reanalysis represents, therefore, a unique opportunity to study the inter-annual variability of\r\nthe Martian weather and climate with respect to all its components, such as the dust cycle, the\r\nwater cycle, the CO2 cycle, the atmospheric tides and other prominent waves, such as high\r\nlatitude baroclinic waves.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution we present the first results of a complete assimilation of both datasets, using a\r\nconsistent model and data assimilation scheme, and highlight the challenges of combining TES\r\nand MCS data assimilation to produce a multi-annual climatology. Particular attention will be\r\ndevoted to the inter-annual variability of the atmospheric thermal field in response to dust storm\r\nactivity. We will also provide an insight into the dynamics, looking in particular at the high latitude\r\nwinds, waves and polar vortices.\r\n\r\nOur data assimilation products are freely available to the community for both science- and\r\nengineering-oriented purposes. The British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC,\r\nhttp://badc.nerc.ac.uk) hosts our datasets, which, for the time being, are limited to the MGS/TES\r\nreanalysis. People may contact the corresponding author in order to register their interest and be\r\nupdated about the status of the project. New versions of the MGS/TES reanalysis as well as the\r\nMRO/MCS reanalysis will be made available through the BADC in future.\r\n\r\nInterested people can download the current TES reanalysis dataset by registering at the BADC\r\nand searching for the MACDA (“Mars Analysis Correction Data Assimilation”) project.

And also where the act of documentation should occur in their ideal workflow.

CEMS has a number of key elements: the provision of access to large-volume EO and climate datasets co-located with high performance computing facilities; a flexible infrastructure to support the needs of research projects in the academic community and new business opportunities for commercial companies. Expertise and tools for scientific data quality and in- tegrity are another essential component, giving users confidence and transparency in its data, services and products.\r\nCentral to the development of this infrastructure is the utilisation of cloud-based technology: multi-tenancy and the dynamic provision of resources are key characteristics to exploit in order to support the range of organisations using the facilities and the varied use cases. The hosting of processing services and applications next to the data within the CEMS facility is another important capability. With the expected exponential increase in data volumes within the climate science and EO domains it is becoming increasingly impracticable for organisations to retrieve this data over networks and provide the necessary storage. Consider for example, the factor of o20 increase in data volumes expected for the ESA Sentinel missions over the equivalent Envisat instruments.\r\n\r\nWe explore the options for the provision of a hybrid community/private cloud looking at offerings from the commercial sector and developments in the Open Source community. Building on this virtualisation layer, a further core services tier will support and serve applications as part of a service oriented architecture. We consider the constituent services in this layer to support access to the data, data processing and the orchestration of workflows.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kershaw, Philip","Curtis, Mark","Pechorro, Ed"],"dc:date":"2012-04-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

IASI is an infrared nadir viewing Fourier transform spectrometer, primarily sensitive to methane in the middle to upper troposphere. Methane is an important greenhouse gas, and knowledge of its distribution, sources and sinks, and trend within the atmosphere are important for our understanding of the current atmosphere and future climate. The ability to measure information on methane from space allows global methane distributions to be derived alongside seasonal and even longer term variations in its concentration. Here, results from our version 1 methane data are described, and their quality is illustrated by comparison to models and other satellite data. In addition, the impact of clouds on the results are investigated. This is found to be a critical source of error leading to anomalously high retrieved methane values","bibo:AuthorList":["Waterfall, Alison M","Siddans, Richard","Kerridge, Brian","Miles, Georgina","Latter, Barry"],"dc:date":"2012-09-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

During the experiment the hydrogen production at low hydraulic retention time (3d) was tested, both with and without reject water recirculation and at two organic loading rate (16 and 21 kgTVS/m3d). The better yields were obtained with recirculation where the pH reached an optimal value (5.5) thanks to the buffering capacity of the system. The specific gas production of the first reactor was 51 l/kgVSfed and H2 content in biogas 37%. The mixture of gas obtained from the two reactors met the standards for the biohythane mix only when lower loading rate were applied to the first reactor, with a composition of 6.7% H2, 40.1% CO2 and 52.3% CH4, and with an overall SGP of 0.78 m3/kgVSfed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cavinato, Cristina","Bolzonella, David","Fatone, Francesco","Cecchi, Franco","Pavan , Paolo"],"dc:date":"2012-10-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":9631827,"ep:Repository":16,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"STFC Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA) Annual Report 2012 (April 2011-March 2012)","bibo:abstract":"The mission of the Centre for Environmental Archival (CEDA) is to deliver long term curation of scientifically important environmental data at the same time as facilitating the use of data by the environmental science community. CEDA was  formed to host two of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) designated data centres: the British Atmospheric Data Centre and the NERC Earth Observation Data Centre, as well as the UK arm of the IPCC Data Distribution Centre. In 2011, the UK Solar System Data Centre joined CEDA. Here we present the fourth annual report, covering joint activities from April 2011 to March 2012 (previously the constituent centres reported independently).\r\nThe report itself is in two sections, the first broadly providing a summary of activities and some statistics, and the second a selection of short reports on some specific activities beginning, under way, or completed. This section is intended to provide a taster for the range of activities that CEDA undertakes, rather than a complete report of activities, since CEDA staff are involved in a huge range of scientific and informatics projects, not all of which are appropriate for reporting here. CEDA continues to engage in informatics projects to help improve the provision of: (1) suitable tools to document and manage both high volume and highly heterogeneous data; (2)tooling and services to enable the community to exploit CEDA data holdings, and; (3) fundamental standards. The latter, both to improve the likelihood that others can build standards compliant software we can deploy, and to support interdisciplinary science.\r\nAs in the previous year, the 2011/2012 year was dominated by the two major challenges of dealing with CMIP5 (e.g. see page 36) and the establishment of new services under the banner of the International Space Innovation Centre (discussed in the articles on CEMS on pages 27 and 28). However, while those were high profile external activities, issues of scale became dominant internally; the funding report on page 14 summarises some of the issues: of the order of 108 files – o(108) – using o(petabytes) of disk, on o(300) different computers, split into o(600) datasets on o(100) disk partitions – without a consistent metadata standard or file format across the archive. Despite a decade of effort on metadata systems, and what had been a very efficient computing environment, CEDA was beginning to creak at the seams – with disk failures, insufficient documentation, and complex network issues becoming more and more prevalent. Ongoing growth using the same technical environment would have been a problem.\r\nFortunately, in late 2011, CEDA received significant capital investment, culminating in the delivery in March 2012 of a new computing system – JASMIN/CEMS – consisting of storage and compute funded both by NERC and UKSA and delivered by CEDA in what was then the e-Science department in STFC (now part of the Scientific Computing Department). JASMIN is discussed on page 26 and CEMS on pages 27 and 28. JASMIN/CEMS are not just about supporting the traditional archival services of CEDA though – they are intended to additionally provide support for high performance analysis of high volume data by the greater NERC scientific community. The physical delivery of these systems is of course just part of the story, in next year’s annual report we will be discussing the difficulty of migrating data to the new environment, and some of the new services which their advent has engendered.\r\nWhile we expect the physical system issues to be resolved with the new hardware, issues of documentation still exist – both in terms of the content, and how it is organised. CEDA continues to invest, with both core and project funding, in new metadata developments, aiming to address both issues.\r\nWork on data publication and citation is intended both to improve the integrity of the scholarly record, and to provide incentives for the production of good documentation, and work on metadata standards to ensure that we have the information organised fit for automating our environment and scientific use!\r\nMany of the one page reports discuss projects in this arena.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lawrence, Bryan N","Callaghan, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2013-01-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
