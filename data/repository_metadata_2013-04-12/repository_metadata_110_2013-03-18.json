In partnership with Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, Creative Partnerships and wallpaper manufacturers Graham and Brown, a series of projects in schools across the Midlands was instigated involving collaborations with young people. Following on from this, certain wallpapers became available in mass retail outlets, such as Homebase, whilst simultaneously appearing in fine art exhibitions such as (2004) ‘The Other Flower’ Show at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Thus the work straddles the traditional Fine Art/ Design divide, as well as the perceived gulf between the original artwork and mass-produced product. In 2004 the wallpaper was nominated for the Classic Design Awards sponsored by Homes and Gardens and exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum’s ‘The Other Flower Show\u0027. The wallpaper contributed to the Amnesty International ‘Protect the Home’ 2006 show at Bargehouse Gallery, London, dealing with domestic violence. In 2007 the project was shown at Leeds City Art Galleries and Museum, Edinburgh Printmakers, and plans are underway with the Digital Wellbeing Laboratory in London.

The research indicated that the vantage-point location of the tourist often encourages ideas of proprietary and ownership, not only of the photograph but also of the view represented. The results of the research project \u0027Conversations with the Landscape\u0027 were presented in the paper. \u0027Conversations\u0027 was one of a number of photographic research projects that interrogated alternative compositional strategies to represent the landscape, which would better communicate political, non- conformist and environmental issues. The work was produced using a mobile phone camera to image a contemporary ‘tour’ of the beauty spots of Wales, which was based upon the picturesque tours of Wales during the 18th and 19th centuries. Early picture messaging technology was deployed to send alternative views of beauty spots, live to Swansea Museum (August 2003). The work explored a photographic re-location from the outsider’s gaze at the distant view to a position immersed within the enclave of the subject.

The chapter posits Lloyd Jones as Wales’s foremost female landscape painter who is intensely aware of her Welsh identity, which she has researched back to runic and hieroglyphic forms in the land, as well as scrutinising old manuscripts and prints in the National Library. Her research is demonstrated in her art, where, by overlaying copies of fragments of these, she recreates stratas of history, thus reflecting the current feeling in Wales on the importance of identity and autonomy. By examining her political agenda, comparisons are made between Wales and other minority cultures which also strive for a sense of identity, often through the preservation of their indigenous language. Other common themes relate to ecology and consumerism which she perceives in the despoilation and pollution of the Welsh landscape.","bibo:AuthorList":["Price-Owen, Anne"],"dc:date":"24-Jun-2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108988,"sim:weight":0.321305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76482,"sim:weight":0.31839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.312094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.279393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108987,"sim:weight":0.268745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.252857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631493,"sim:weight":0.225708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.216338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.190879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108667,"sim:weight":0.158854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109002,"sim:weight":0.156098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76670,"sim:weight":0.146014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The research questions explored in this work informed Evans\u0027s hypothesis questioning male nudity in relation to spectatorship and ‘the male gaze’. The origins of the work can be traced to the photographic work ‘Miner’s Memorial’ (2001) featured in Edward Lucie-Smith’s ‘Art Tomorrow’ (ISBN 2-87939-252-7) and seeks to challenge ideas of spectatorship and the male gaze put forward by Laura Mulvey’s article \u0027Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\u0027 and questions if her hypothesis is as relevant to the media of the 21st century as it seemed in 1973. The method used was to set a framework of limitations in recording an auto-portrait. Initially, the limitation was to record Evans\u0027s body at arm\u0027s length, with a hand held digital camera. It was the intention at this stage in the research to represent a ‘focussed’ photographic nude. In following the coded rules of photographic spectatorship Evans offered himself up to the viewer as a passive male body before changing the pose from reclining nude to a more actively posed nude, thus confronting the viewer with his gaze in order to question the structure of the male gaze as well as its implications with regard to same sex gender. This method of auto-portraiture developed into the \u0027Bed Sheet Dreams\u0027 body of work which is a ‘defocused’ mutable approach to self portraiture and has been the main inspiration for most of Evans\u0027s subsequent research in looking at and challenging notions of the male body, spectatorship, mutability, time and colour theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Evans, John Paul"],"dc:date":"2004-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85563,"sim:weight":0.235869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.19075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53655,"sim:weight":0.174691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Some of the earliest photographic images were made at Margam. Steel made Margam Park, whose gothic mansion looks down on the town and the works formerly owned by the Fox Talbots. As part of the development of the project and publication, Page was commissioned to work as artist-in-residence at St. Joseph\u0027s School in Port Talbot for a period of three months. During this time he worked with pupils and staff to explore issues of representation of their local environment, questioning the diversity of place and how this might be depicted through various photographic strategies. Alongside this he developed a body of work aimed at striking a dialogue with work produced by the pupils. A publication launch and exhibition were organised by Ffotogallery and Seren Books, held at the Orangery in Margam Park in November 2002. In response to the notion of heritage, Page\u0027s portfolio contribution ‘Spoiled’, focused on spaces which are not valued as culturally important and are not seen as worth protecting. Wastelands fall outside of this coherent picture of the British landscape and history, and are therefore, by consequence, deemed extraneous; ex-industrial sites or undeveloped patches of land which proliferate throughout the diverse landscape of Port Talbot, bordering the pockets of ‘valuable’ land; golf-courses, housing estates, leisure centres, retail parks and industrial complexes. The wasteland is a largely ignored by-product of the consumption process that happens in these sites.","bibo:AuthorList":["Page, Richard"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

People felt they knew the tent, the bed, the shark, the fly-infested cow\u0027s head, whether they made it to the gallery or not. The concept was more telling than the reality. When you saw the pieces in an exhibition (and very large numbers of us did) they turned out to be more banal than you expected.\" This article proposes an art school pedagogy which addresses Peter Campbell\u0027s critical observation by advocating that the degree of balance between conceptual intrigue and perceptual intrigue in contemporary visual art be considered as a main criterion of quality assessment. It is suggested that the perceived imbalance between the two, alluded to by Campbell, might be remedied by addressing the long-standing aversion to theory demonstrated by many art school lecturers; an aversion often justified by citing Barnett Newman\u0027s famous quip denigrating the relevance of visual aesthetics theory to artists. The article effectively debunks Newman\u0027s false logic. It is argued that students\u0027 practice would be empowered by a pedagogy which integrates, rather than denigrates, the theoretical bases of visual art practice – especially those of visual perception and visual communication – within the curriculum, and which provides the means to understanding the socio-political contexts in which contemporary visual art is produced, positioned in the public domain and evaluated: a twenty-first century version of the \u0027Artworld\u0027 first identified by Arthur C. Danto in 1964. The article ends with five theoretical premises upon which a curriculum for the art school of the future might be constructed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Riley, Howard"],"dc:date":"2007-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These modes are explained, and then integrated in a multimodal systemic-functional semiotic model which, it is argued, both facilitates the analysis of narrative film and would  empower  the production of narrative film. Michael O’Toole’s adaptations for use in the visual arts of Michael Halliday’s systemic-functional semiotic model of English grammar are here themselves  adapted so as to identify three functions of narrative film: the representational,  which refers to the ideational content of a film, the interpersonal, which  refers to the way  that film can embody its maker’s ideological stance as well as position the viewer in terms of mood and attitude towards the narrative displayed, and the constructional,  which functions to realise the other two.  All three functions involve a process of  selection and combination from the range, or systems, of available  semiotic choices. These functions operate simultaneously in film, but for the purposes of teaching and understanding they may be studied as discrete processes at various levels of analysis, the levels together  forming what Halliday termed a rank scale. The paper proposes three levels within a rank scale suitable for the analysis of film: shot, the smallest unit; scene, comprising a series of shots; and film, comprising a series of scenes displayed as an entity in itself. The two-dimensional  matrix which is formed when the three functions are arranged along a horizontal axis and the three levels of the rank scale are arranged along a vertical  axis, becomes the space in which available systems or clines of semiotic options may be articulated for each identified mode. In this way the meaning potential of narrative film is mapped out in a systematic and accessible way, highlighting the richness and complexities of the semiotic choices available when discussing or indeed making narrative film. Each of the eight modes through which narrative film may be displayed is allocated a two-dimensional matrix as described above,  and the paper illustrates the arrangement of these eight matrices stacked one above the other to form a three-dimensional matrix, a visual metaphor  representing not only the complexities of choices inherent in both the interpretation and production of narrative film, but also the multimodal matrix makes evident common semiotic principles present in all eight modes, through the use of a comparative terminology. The presentation of the paper  includes  a demonstration of the 3-D matrix as a teaching tool in interactive DVD format, and a discussion of the testing of the teaching tool with the cooperation of a group of undergraduate design and media students. Interim results from the teaching exercise indicate that students’ abilities to analyse and discuss the structures and meanings of narrative film is positively enhanced. The paper concludes with a proposal for the next stage in the research: the application of the model in the teaching of the production of narrative film at undergraduate level and beyond.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hughes, Angela Ungoed"],"dc:date":"25-May-2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.24027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.192583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A key technique in the authors\u0027 methodology has been the use of video-stimulated reflective dialogue to assist teachers to reflect on key episodes in their teaching. In this paper the authors discuss how this technique was extended to encourage pupils to reflect on their learning. Children in parallel classes with and without interactive whiteboards were interviewed in a range of subject areas between the ages of 5 and 14. Analysis of reflective dialogues indicates that even very young children were able to articulate opinions about the ways in which ICT supported their learning. Pupils were able to talk more explicitly about the impact of ICT on their learning processes in classes that had a focus on thinking skills and learning to learn. The role of ICT in supporting learning was viewed in a variety of ways by pupils. Many of these were common across ages and contexts, but others were critically dependent on the classroom culture and the nature of the dominant style of classroom discourse. A wider range of affordances of ICT was exploited in classes in which the dominant discourse was dialogical.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tanner, Howard F.

Yet, for those responsible for allocating large sums of money to the development of ICT in education, it is important to identify, characterise, measure and model more precisely the features and processes through which technology impacts upon teaching and learning activities. This article offers a framework for analysing the effects of ICT in combination with the other factors which may enhance or ameliorate the positive impact of ICT in the classroom and beyond. This framework is applicable to different levels of evaluation, including large scale curriculum development programmes, curriculum and pedagogical change in particular schools, and individual teachers\u0027 planning and reflection. Its use in evaluating new ICT-based teaching approaches at classroom level is illustrated and analysed in the context of an in-service teacher education programme in the United Kingdom, and suggestions are made concerning the development of evaluation tools based on the framework.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kennewell, Steve"],"dc:date":"2001-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Some of these have involved children identified as disaffected or disadvantaged, whilst others have involved initial teacher education students. In this paper, we consider some of the results obtained from the most recent of these settings, relate these to those obtained from the other settings, and explore further a number of inter-related issues which have arisen from the analysis. We particularly focus on the effect of learners’ self-esteem and self-efficacy; the influence of gender-related characteristics; the role of interaction between learners during activity; and the value of reflection. Our research found a consistently positive relationship between learners’ self-belief with ICT and subsequent attainment through play activity, whereas their access to technology at home seems to have little effect on their subsequent learning. Furthermore, it was a specific ICT self-efficacy, rather than a more general self-esteem, which appeared to influence the development of ICT capability. The average attainment of boys and girls was very similar, but there were significant differences in the distributions in that the majority of the very high and very low achievers in terms of competences achieved were boys. Male student teachers attained significantly higher competence levels even after taking account of higher initial skill levels. The degree of interaction between learners varied between groups, and although this was not measured directly, there was some evidence of greater attainment by those who shared ideas together. Our results suggest that play activity can be very successful in developing aspects of ICT capability, and that play may be valuable as a mode of learning with adults and older children as well as the young children with which it is usually associated. However, there are important factors to be considered in order to provide the conditions needed for success, and it will be important that we do not disadvantage further those who are least confident with technology and the already disaffected males.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kennewell, Steve","Morgan, Alex"],"dc:date":"2006-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.380942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57289,"sim:weight":0.314997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.304079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.287347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Pedagogical actions supported by these features were identified and views concerning the impact of these actions on learning were analysed.

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1997 stated that paraprofessionals could be used to provide special education and related services as long as they were \"adequately trained and supervised.\" This requirement for supervision was reiterated in the 2004 reauthorization of the IDEA known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) by adding that such use of paraprofessionals must be in line with state regulation and policy. In this article, the authors discuss the intricacies of the administrator\u0027s role in paraprofessional supervision to support ethnic minority students with special needs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ashbaker, Betty Y.","Morgan, Jill"],"dc:date":"2006-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.253858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108762,"sim:weight":0.209945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Results and conclusions: There were five main findings, namely the use of the category of \u0027unauthorized absence\u0027 was used inconsistently in some schools; a challenge was posed by parents taking pupils out of school for term-time holidays; the reports appeared to make minimal allowance for background characteristics such as socio-economic profile, location or pupil intake; the overall average score awarded for attendance was lower than for any other of the aspects of the school assessed; and the inspectors interpreted the government\u0027s targets for school attendance literally, not taking into account mitigating circumstances.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reid, Ken"],"dc:date":"2006-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8821113,"sim:weight":0.364344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27869,"sim:weight":0.283546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article focuses upon the traffic lights (TL) scheme which has been formulated to monitor and manage pupils\u0027 attendance within schools in a more controlled manner. The conventional approach to introducing the TL scheme is described. This is followed by two variations of the scheme adapted by schools for their own purposes. Evidence from each of the three utilisations of the TL scheme has suggested that overall attendance within the schools has been significantly improved with gains of around 8% reported. Finally, the article illustrates how the TL scheme can be adapted to help reduce potential cases of exclusion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reid, Ken"],"dc:date":"2003-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.185697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Educational institutions in myriad forms have reflected aspects of these manifestations and themselves shed some light on their nature. In turn, the historiography of education in Wales is itself a product of national, educational, social and scholarly preoccupations which both reflect the ideas and priorities of the time and shed some light on their nature and significance. It is the purpose of this article to make a preliminary exploration into some of these interactions and, in so doing, provide an introduction to some of the major secondary sources of information on Welsh education. To this end, the article outlines in very general terms outstanding landmarks in those elements of Welsh education since the early modern period which might be claimed to be distinctive and the way in which the historiography reflects and reinforces such claims. Although the article sketches the picture in the centuries from the Tudors to industrialisation, its main thrust, reflecting the historiography, is on the period since the nineteenth century when the England/Wales state took over the financing of the education of its citizens to an ever increasing extent. Within this period, there is particular emphasis on such episodes as the \u0027Treason of the Blue Books\u0027 in 1847, the Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889, the \u0027Welsh Revolt\u0027 following the Education Act of 1902 and the more subtle but steady devolutionary episodes evident in the twentieth century, culminating in the creation of the National Assembly for Wales in 1999. All have generated a range of secondary works which itself reflects the priorities of historians in a scholarly environment which, since the 1960s, has seen changes in approach to the study of history which have allowed historians of Welsh education to take their place in the mainstream of historical studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Gareth Elwyn"],"dc:date":"2006-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.354197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.292594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.278298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.252455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.249673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60337,"sim:weight":0.206691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.192737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.168045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There is an assumption that such an approach to assessment for graduate award-bearing programmes will support the learning and development of teaching professionals and allow them to demonstrate the critical reflection and critical thinking required for accreditation. This study reports on the work of 55 police officers who work full-time with pupils aged 5-16 to promote aspects of the Personal and Social Education curriculum in Wales. Portfolios submitted for assessment for a Graduate Diploma have been analysed for evidence of critical reflection and thinking, and factors that enabled such reflection and thinking to take place are identified. Drawing on our research diaries and qualitative questionnaire data, we argue that the concept of situated practice provides an explanatory tool for understanding how officers have made the transition from \u0027presenters\u0027 of an education programme to professional educators. Our work has implications for other continuing professional development providers working with the increasing numbers of school para-professionals.

The thesis is explored mainly by means of three case studies: the reaction of the local authorities to the Education Act of 1902, which eventually escalated into a national movement dubbed \u0027the Welsh revolt\u0027; the response of some local authorities, particularly in industrial Wales, to the 1932 legislation which required them to replace their free secondary school places with special places; and the attempts of some councils to resist the largely clandestine attempts of the Ministry of Education and its Welsh Department to impose a tripartite system of secondary education against their wishes after 1944. This tradition of independent action in Wales bears on contemporary patterns of power and policy. The article concludes by suggesting that, in an education power structure now radically altered by the creation of the National Assembly for Wales in 1999, the local authorities are regarded more favourably than is the case in England and vested with significantly more responsibility, so making it likely that their future course will diverge increasingly from that of their English counterparts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Gareth Elwyn"],"dc:date":"2002-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108230,"sim:weight":0.301743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.291218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108336,"sim:weight":0.287367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84845,"sim:weight":0.268933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.237208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108857,"sim:weight":0.207819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.148758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29421,"sim:weight":0.129481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is argued that informal learning consists of three components: implicit learning, learning through experience and non-taught or deliberative learning (following Eraut, 2004). Such forms of learning can be underpinned by theoretical notions of cognitive, affective and behavioural developments. A model of work-based informal learning is proposed that also tries to incorporate the memories of relevant past and current events.

Preliminary computational modelling of a representative windscreen defect illustrates the predisposition of ‘star-shaped’ chips to crack-off to a windscreen edge under typical vehicle usage.","bibo:AuthorList":["Donne, Kelvin E.","Thomas, Richard D.","Davies, Christopher","Calvert, Geoffrey"],"dc:date":"2007-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.18654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26027,"sim:weight":0.149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.14424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.142641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26001,"sim:weight":0.13533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27821,"sim:weight":0.133543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27903,"sim:weight":0.131281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.11119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A 240 m length of beach, bounded by a slipway, sea wall, and pier, was surveyed each September and April between 1997 and 2002 to assess summer and winter changes. Results in September 1997 showed that sediment transport was southerly in direction, whilst by September 2002, there had been a consistent return to the traditionally accepted south-to-north longshore drift, verified by significant differences in longshore gradients (t \u003d 2.664; degrees of freedom [DF] \u003d 6; p \u003c 0.05). Analysis of changes in beach morphology has shown that erosion induced a southerly movement of beach contours, and a northerly movement was produced by accretion. Foreshore analysis has resulted in important regression models representing the variation of the shoreline indicator mean high water (MHW) with both shoreline position (mean beach level) and gain/loss of beach material. The cross-shore position of the depth of closure (DoC) was 50 m seaward of the survey line, at a water depth of 5.5 m. Results from analyses of cross-shore profiles verified temporal variations in back beach level with little variation beyond the DoC. Furthermore, there was significant correlation between the two shoreline indicators, MHW and DoC (84%). This correlation, combined with a derived equation for a management response parameter (MRP \u003d 17.035 + tan−1 (x14 − x6)/240[°]), produced simple tools to rapidly assess beach health. Results were compared with past data for interpretation of significance, and management strategies based on tabulated MRP values are suggested. A general form of this equation has been developed for testing at other beach locations, which should have significance for worldwide beach management.","bibo:AuthorList":["Philips, Michael Roberts","Williams, A.

A 160 m groyned beach, composed of four groynes and three bays, adjacent to and seaward of the barrage breakwater was monitored between September 1997 and September 2002 to assess pre- and postconstruction beach evolution. Overall, mean beach levels increased throughout the five-year period, resulting in a net gain of beach covering equivalent to 818.8 m3 (1800 tonnes). After barrage completion, both longshore and cross-shore gradients became less volatile and increased beach levels in the bay nearest the breakwater, prevented tidal action and erosion at the cliff toe. This was a significant change from initial conditions that was verified by parametric and nonparametric tests at the 99% confidence level. Regression analysis determined that there were significant temporal relationships. Spatial analysis identified two highly significant longshore trends with respect to distance from the breakwater and showed that this influence decreased with distance. More than 72 m from the breakwater, the regression equation (R2 \u003d 96%) modelled a trend of falling beach levels caused by net sediment transport. Conversely, from 72 m to the breakwater, beach levels increased at a rate greater than twice the fall in the previous section (R2 \u003d 92%). These trends were further supported by significantly greater level differences across the second groyne. Impacts of temporal and spatial trends, especially subsequent to barrage completion, were evidenced by the change in beach morphology and similar contour orientation in all three bays. Models were developed and proposed as management tools to identify potential changes in coastal processes, as well as the rate of change of the barrage\u0027s upstream influence with respect to net sediment flow. Groyne removal was suggested to provide recreational beach space.","bibo:AuthorList":["Philips, Michael Roberts"],"dc:date":"2007-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84645,"sim:weight":0.440714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29455,"sim:weight":0.415506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14815,"sim:weight":0.344486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27359,"sim:weight":0.284025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494030,"sim:weight":0.242899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84223,"sim:weight":0.234468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26712,"sim:weight":0.220967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14877,"sim:weight":0.217549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14835,"sim:weight":0.210611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29475,"sim:weight":0.182472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.176573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108986,"sim:weight":0.16749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108837,"sim:weight":0.163494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26277,"sim:weight":0.159401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108951,"sim:weight":0.157785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97202,"sim:weight":0.157087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.140767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29761,"sim:weight":0.127429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84240,"sim:weight":0.120498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Some marked litter was found to disappear from the beach surface, re-emerging weeks later which suggests that the potential for litter burial has been underestimated in litter research. Higher wave energies between surveys coincided with higher levels of previously unseen litter. These new inputs consisted of sea borne and exhumed litter.

A main root checklist together with two daughter ones were devised in order to achieve this objective. The main root checklist comprised six categories (site and dune morphology, beach condition, surface character of the seaward 200 m of dune, vegetation, anthropogenic impact and protection measures in place) and dunes were classified according to their vulnerability compared to protection measures. The Resilience daughter checklist encompassed dune erosion, sand input, sand retention, degradation by use and dune management. This was compared with risk factors such as obstacles to dune transgression and recreation. The geomorphology, aeolian, vegetation, anthropogenic, marine influences daughter checklist looked at 30 dune systems in the Gulf of Cadiz and assessed dune condition by a dune vulnerability index based on the above conditioning influences. Values for all checklists were expressed as percentages. Over 200 dune sites in Spain, France, Portugal and the UK were analysed by means of these checklists. Results confirmed that regional trends concerned with dune vulnerability could be assessed, although successful differentiation at the end of the dune spectrum (large sand sheets, e.g. Pyla, France and meadow formation, e.g. many of the UK systems) and at the local scale were muted. An innovative aerial digital photographic system was developed and photographs were successfully used to assess dune condition, anthropogenic impact on dune systems, etc., i.e. the checklist parameters and was used to modify checklist procedures in assessing regional dune degradation. Ca 70% of the checklist parameters could be obtained by this means. This also provided a photographic record of the current dune condition. Principal component analysis provided a strong justification for the majority of checklist questions and the approach and relevance of the technique. The enumerated techniques provide valuable tools for dune managers. Rapid assessment of large areas of coastline can be obtained at a low cost and the resulting remote sensed images can provide a permanent record of the condition of the photographed dunes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, A.

Twenty-six top-rated parameters were identified from a literature search/questionnaire surveys carried out in Malta, Turkey and the UK and coastal scenery investigated at 57 sites. A coastal scenic evaluation checklist system was finalized and consisted of assessment parameters based on a five-point scale ranging from low to high attribute values. Coastal user parameter preferences and priorities for these parameters were obtained by a questionnaire perception study (n\u003d270) given to both locals and visitors. Assessment parameter weights were calculated from this public perception survey via matrices relating to the selected landscape components. For each of the 26 parameters, a membership-graded matrix was established to counteract potential errors in assigning grades to the parameters when one has to give a unique number to the attribute value. To overcome subjectivity and quantify uncertainty, fuzzy logic mathematical methodology was adopted to this checklist approach. This enabled an Evaluation Index (D) value to be calculated, establishing a 5-class evaluation system. Class 1 scenery (extremely attractive natural site) had D values \u003e 0.85; Class 2, between 0.85 and 0.65; Class 3, between 0.65 and 0.4; Class 4, between 0.4 and zero; Class 5 (very unattractive, intensively developed urban) below zero.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ergin, A.","Karaesmen, E.","Micallef, Anton","Williams, A.

These six books could point the way towards meaningful change. This must be considered seriously. After all, there is little evidence to suggest that what we have done over the years has worked or that what we are doing currently is a great deal better. The world of modern foreign languages learning and teaching never stays in the same place for very long. Given that we tend to go back to methods and aspects of methods already tried and tested in previous generations, albeit with a different slant, the analogy is with a pendulum swinging restlessly back and forth rather than some sharp-pointed machine forging new ground. The purpose of this article is to try to identify where writers think foreign/second language learning is going in the next ten or twenty years. The authors take six research-based books written recently. Some of these have been reviewed in LLJ. The issues raised in these books are looked at afresh from the point of view of their contribution to our knowledge-base about foreign language learning and teaching processes. Those not already reviewed in LLJ deserve attention for the valuable contribution they make to this discussion. Common themes emerge from the reviews of the six publications:","bibo:AuthorList":["Chambers, Gary N.","Norman, Nigel"],"dc:date":"2003-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8821117,"sim:weight":0.336919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.333161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.31402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.308583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60331,"sim:weight":0.276159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57289,"sim:weight":0.23217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176792,"sim:weight":0.219913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.219836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109202,"sim:weight":0.215539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.213208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An assessment of environmental strategic coastal management of public events.","bibo:abstract":"The seasonal demographics of many coastal communities’ means public events are prominent features in their socio-economic calendars and these need empirical assessment to facilitate strategic coastal management in Europe.  This study adapted a carbon footprint calculator developed by Krause to assess the environmental impact of participants in coastal events in Mumbles, South Wales.  The methodology included semi structured interviews with event organisers and local businesses both pre and post event.  Additionally on the day of the event, 100 ecological footprint questionnaires were completed structured on the following themes: household details; waste; food and drink; transport and travel.  The calculated results showed a carbon footprint mean of 293.7.  Travel was the major factor but a standard deviation of 36.4 indicated considerable variability in its contribution to the scores.  Food and drink was the other important contributor especially in the 18-25 age range.  From the results a check list for coastal managers in Europe has been proposed to act as a tool for improving the strategic management of public events particularly in tourist areas such as the Mediterranean.  Future work needs to test empirical mechanism for measuring the environmental impact of public events so that the coastal zone can be physically, socially and economically sustained.","bibo:AuthorList":["House, Christopher","Phillips, Michael","Beynon, Peter"],"dc:date":"2008-10-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.233561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.230836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58899,"sim:weight":0.166019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108754,"sim:weight":0.164881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Similar events occurred during the 1990s along the South Wales coastline, specifically Llantwit Major, where a Surf Life Saving Club was destroyed. These failures followed severe storms from the southwest quadrant and an analysis was undertaken of comparative causes and effects. Near-shore sediment transport is easterly along both coastlines. Port developments interfere with net longshore drift and maintenance dredging further complicates sediment distribution. Predominant winds from the southwest quadrant, corresponding to the longest fetch at both locations, generate severe storm wave attack on coastal infrastructure whilst aggregate dredging is a common concern.\nAnalysis showed that river aggregate dredging at Konyaalti beach reduced sediment supply, which in turn caused significant narrowing of the beach. This allowed direct storm wave attack onto the seawall and resulted in its failure. Whilst the port development to the west interfered with longshore drift, it was uncertain as to its contribution to beach narrowing. Although marine aggregate dredging in the Severn Estuary/Bristol Channel is a public concern, there is no direct link to beach erosion. The destruction of the Surf Life Saving Club, subsequently rebuilt, was due to inappropriate location of amenity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Phillips, Michael"],"dc:date":"2006-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14815,"sim:weight":0.403156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29455,"sim:weight":0.371161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84645,"sim:weight":0.366428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14835,"sim:weight":0.333354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14827,"sim:weight":0.304346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1441155,"sim:weight":0.298981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2754876,"sim:weight":0.287725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26712,"sim:weight":0.238634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14817,"sim:weight":0.227363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84223,"sim:weight":0.222524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14829,"sim:weight":0.221995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84240,"sim:weight":0.214219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14877,"sim:weight":0.210026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14785,"sim:weight":0.198165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27359,"sim:weight":0.190245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84284,"sim:weight":0.187247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97198,"sim:weight":0.179601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14773,"sim:weight":0.170569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14825,"sim:weight":0.163249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.162016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It has been suggested that poor drawing may be a particular problem for students with dyslexia (and \na high proportion of art school students is dyslexic). In Study 1 we studied 277 art students, using a \nquestionnaire to assess self-perceived drawing ability and a range of background measures, including \ndemography, education, a history of dyslexia, a self-administered spelling test, and personality and \neducational variables. In Study 2 we gave detailed drawing tests to a sample of 38 of the art students, \nstratified by self-rated drawing ability and spelling ability, and to 30 control participants. Students \nperceiving themselves as good at drawing did indeed draw better than self-perceived poor drawers, \nalthough the latter were still better than non-art student controls. In neither Study 1 nor Study 2 did skill \nat drawing relate to dyslexia or spelling ability, and neither did drawing ability relate to any of our wide \nrange of background measures. However Study 2 did show that drawing ability was related both to ability \nat copying simple angles and proportions (using the “house” task of Cain, 1943), and also to visual \nmemory (as suggested by Jones, 1922), poor drawers being less good at both immediate and delayed \nrecall of the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Riley, Howard","McManus, Chris","Brunswick, Nicola","Rankin, Qona","Chamberlain, Rebecca"],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1037/a0017335","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108924,"sim:weight":0.294619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108976,"sim:weight":0.277914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.247829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85134,"sim:weight":0.202841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108251,"sim:weight":0.181523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.173353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.164114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26616,"sim:weight":0.145318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.12051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23814,"sim:weight":0.115382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
