We first debate the explicit and implicit objectives, and the\nliterature suggests that the three objectives are: to increase employability; to widen participation; to reduce cost.\nIn the main, a tripartite relationship between higher and further education and an employer is demanded. It is tricky to manage such an operation effectively, and this paper explores the relationships involved in developing and running foundation degrees. We analyse the Quality Assurance Agency reviews and other research findings on Foundation Degrees in order to gauge the success of such partnerships.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gilbert, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T09:36:28Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Smithers.

In order to respond to and maintain public confidence, universities must design and\nimplement tailored courses quickly and rigorously. While some universities are experienced\nand quality-assure their work-based learning courses effectively, developments are patchy.\nResponse to a recent survey highlights two\nissues: firstly, the difficulty universities have making contact and building relationships with\nemployers, and secondly, the perceived bureaucracy and complexity of validation\nprocesses. In delivering work-based learning courses universities must assure the\nstandards of student achievement and maintain the quality of the student experience. This\nassurance begins with the design and approval of a course.\nThe research presented here is part of a larger research project sponsored by the\nAssociation for Business Schools that traces quality assurance through the\nentire life cycle of curriculum development and delivery. This paper focuses specifically on\nthe design and approval stages and makes recommendations for the modification of\nuniversity regulations and processes. A university growing its work-based learning\nprovision should review its curriculum framework, consider fast-track validations and the\nuse of standing panels and phased approvals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gilbert, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T09:40:37Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Brennan and B Little.

This is an interdisciplinary endeavour, drawing on pedagogical, political and psychological perspectives.\nThe study took place within a state funded primary school in Chelmsford, a city in south-east England. Data was collected from twelve five-six year old year 1 children using three qualitatively different methods: (a) children’s drawings, which considered the choices that children made in terms of two themes: their ‘actual school experience’ and their ‘ideal school experience’. (b) Children were interviewed in pairs and their response was analysed by using phenomenographic techniques and finally; photographic/video evidence of different areas of the class/setting, taken/videoed by children themselves. Categories of description were made using these photographs and videos and children were asked to discuss their views about these classroom areas with the researcher.\nFindings revealed that children liked coming to school and enjoyed doing a range of activities with their teacher(s) and friends. They however, wanted to spend more time outside. These voices were then discussed to see whether young people\u0027s participation in such research can contribute to a joint exploration of understanding of their perspectives by both, teachers and children themselves and so contribute towards a more sustainable/meaningful pedagogy. On reflection, the school believes that a learning environment developed in collaboration with children is more sympathetic and responsive to their needs and aspirations. Further, that the process will encourage self-determination and participation, and hence will act to empower children.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kanyal, Mallika","Cooper, Linda"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T11:04:54Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Boud and N Falchikov.

Twelve five- six year old children from a state funded primary school (Key Stage 1) in south-east England formed the sample for the study. To explore their understanding of school experience, three qualitative participatory methods: children‘s drawings; children‘s pair interviews, analysed using phenomenography; and photographic/video evidence of different areas of the class/setting, taken/videoed by children themselves, were used. Findings from all three methods explicitly suggest that children liked coming to school and enjoyed doing a range of activities with their teacher(s) and friends. It is also evident that they wanted to spend more time outside. The paper therefore is an attempt to argue the contention in participatory research where researches claim that children‘s voices needed to be heard without putting adult interpretation into it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kanyal, Mallika"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T11:11:43Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H B Andreu and M Nussbaum.

The expansion of early childhood provision and the economic investment made for such provision has gradually led to the introduction of curricula in order to establish the benefits and returns of the provision. Some of the curricula emphasise wellbeing, belongingness and connectedness with others, community and place; others are\noutcomes-based developmental models that celebrate individuality, personal achievement and children‟s becoming.\nIn this paper, I will explore the philosophical underpinnings of four contemporary curricula to consider the worldviews of early childhood upheld and promoted by them. I will then draw\nparallels with the Athenian and Spartan educational systems and models in ancient Greece to consider the implications of the worldviews of childhood held in contemporary curricula with regard to the demands and “knowns” of today‟s society and to the “unknowns” and unforeseeable needs of future generations. Finally, I will conclude with the argument that it is the pedagogy, embraced by early years professionals, which is the mediating force for reconciling different worldviews of early childhood embraced in contemporary curricula.","bibo:AuthorList":["Papatheodorou, Theodora"],"dc:date":"2011-04-26T15:12:03Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Renzo Barazzoni.

Some had encountered Forest School before, but for some it was new. We had worked through bits of theory and reading online and then met up for a day in the woods. They bravely overcame any trepidation about being wild in a wood in January. By the end of the session they were all very enthusiastic and could see the benefits for the children in their settings, but many of them felt that there are still barriers to overcome with colleagues for whom outdoor play is, even now, just for letting off steam in between the real activities of the day.\nI have run similar courses before, but had always assumed that the enthusiasm of the participants was in some measure due to the fact that they were self-selecting. This was not true of this group, as the CPD programme is a requirement for them, and yet they were as equally enthusiastic as other groups. If one session in a wood (together with access to a range of supporting readings) can influence the way in which change agents like EYPs view their outdoor provision, then perhaps this is a way to promote quality in outdoor provision. Perhaps we can even move away from seeing outdoor play as just a release from other activities – although maybe the implied criticism of being indoors is one to reflect on, too.","bibo:AuthorList":["Knight, Sara A."],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T08:50:10Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Borradaile.

On the course, students examine their current work-practice to identify issues and then plan, implement and evaluate an improvement strategy. Negotiated learning activities and facilitated networking environmentsare key to providing students with a highly personalised and relevant learning experience.  Students were surveyed and interviewed through questionnaire, telephone and face-to-face meeting. Staff were asked to produce accounts identifying major issues within their particular role, describing and evaluating steps taken to mitigate them. In both cases, transcripts were examined using interpretive phenomenological analysis and this grounded approach was used to identify key issues.  \nThe findings show that challenges for the improvement of the learning experience included a range of issues unified by concerns regarding diversity of approach and complexity. It is proposed that this was partly \ndue to knowledge held tacitly but unarticulated. To improve practice, a Pattern Language approach is proposed. In order to articulate values and ideas, a Pattern Language category of Online Community of Inquiry is outlined.  \nThese patterns are framed as instructions to inform an approach to new working practices, technologies and systems local to the context in which they were found. It is suggested that this approach helps teaching staff, developers, administrators, and students working together to understand and overcome problems in their own contexts, by adapting these and other patterns.","bibo:AuthorList":["Powell, Stephen","Millwood, Richard","Tindal, Ian"],"dc:date":"2011-05-10T10:36:56Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C Argyris, R Putnam, McLain Smith and D.

To examine that hypothesis the authors surveyed firms in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry where reputation is a highly visible challenge.

The data indicate a positive correlation in five areas – that is, between reputation and having an ongoing reputation measurement program; having an active reputation management program; having a formal reputation management plan; having an individual or unit charged with responsibility for coordinating / overseeing reputation management; and having the chief communication officer as a member of the company‘s executive committee.","bibo:AuthorList":["Goldstein, Kimberly","Doorley, John","Turner, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011-05-26T10:59:33Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S E Abraham, B A Friedman, R H Khan and R J Skolnik.

This is therefore viewed as a scoping\nstudy, paving the way for a more detailed investigation\nand analysis. A detailed literature review of current issues faced by business schools was conducted as part of the research.\nBy far the most significant question arising from this review relates to the focus for business schools: Should business schools be helping business or helping humanity through business?

The benefits to mature women of entering childcare","bibo:abstract":"This paper argues for continuing diversity in the training of childcare workers. It\ndemonstrates what might be lost if we focus too narrowly on professional standards when\nestablishing and funding vocational training. It is not arguing against improving standards,\nquite the reverse, but seeking to reveal some of the hidden benefits arising when women\nare allowed a less direct route into the profession, one that integrates their personal and\nfamily needs, and allows them simultaneously to be part-time mothers, students and\nworkers.\nAs part of a doctoral study, the presenter, a childcare tutor, collected background information\nby questionnaire from 150 former students who trained over a ten-year period and invited\na sample of 33 to explore with her what adult education meant to them. The approach was\ninformal, using conversational style interviews to help students to consider the impact of\neducation over their life-course in addition to reflecting specifically on the expectations,\nexperiences and consequences of enrolment on a Diploma in childcare.\nGiven the vocational nature of the course, it was anticipated that the interviews would\nbe career-oriented. However, in practice they demonstrated a focus on present lives that\nsuggests that adult education, in this case, childcare training, does far more than develop\nsubject-specific skills. This paper briefly outlines the diverse range of consequences\narising from learning to work with children concluding that these are important to the\nstudents themselves, their families, the local community and the wider society but that\nultimately they benefit the children attending day-care.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wright, Hazel R."],"dc:date":"2011-05-11T15:23:00Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4150681,"sim:weight":0.706388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160612,"sim:weight":0.703051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16848,"sim:weight":0.699541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2442,"sim:weight":0.682738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2473,"sim:weight":0.678371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.660373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":799,"sim:weight":0.655388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.653777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158478,"sim:weight":0.618117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157862,"sim:weight":0.608226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9016333,"sim:weight":0.602763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384049,"sim:weight":0.596429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83406,"sim:weight":0.594736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83520,"sim:weight":0.590968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85984,"sim:weight":0.58379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41267,"sim:weight":0.57449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.572108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93863,"sim:weight":0.549876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154475,"sim:weight":0.548086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82824,"sim:weight":0.547409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A case study of mature women training to work in childcare","bibo:abstract":"Most studies of adult education align this with life change but my research project tells a different story revealing that mature women training to work in childcare were seeking continuity in their lives, engaging with activities that connected aspects of the family, workplace and educational experience and constructing a sense of personal identity through these linkages. The recently completed project studied a group of mature women who enrolled on an Early Years Supervisors‟ course over a ten-year period in a Further Education (FE) College in Eastern England. This was a vocational course, funded at times by different government initiatives - local, national or European - as part of the broader aim to raise standards within childcare in the UK and because of its work orientation might have been accessed for predominately instrumental purposes: to support a career in childcare work. Expecting that to be the case, I anticipated that the majority of the women would talk about career paths, salary structures and end goals but found that not to be the case. Instead, they discussed a range of alternative motivations that we shall look at further in this paper.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wright, Hazel R."],"dc:date":"2011-05-11T15:15:38Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Bourdieu and J-C Passeron.

Two of the professionals involved in the project offer\nperspectives which relate some findings from the project to their growing\nunderstandings of conflicting literacy practices. An early childhood lecturer\nconsiders the disequilibrium arising from conflict as a necessary condition for\ncreating knowledge. A specialist subject librarian then uses the concept of\nknowledge communities as the basis for a discussion of ways in which\nstudents and university staff may negotiate conflicting literacies. The paper\nconcludes by drawing parallels between literacy as social practice in early\nchildhood and related understandings of the challenges of learning and\nteaching academic literacies in higher education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Luff, Paulette","Papatheodorou, Theodora","Bradwell, Alan"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T09:07:50Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Barton and M Hamilton.

The findings show that there has been a very positive response from students, and that the system can be effective in a number of ways, including engaging more students within lectures.  This blended learning approach has given a voice to a large number of students intimidated by a classroom or group environment, enabling them to ask questions, put forth an opinion and interact with fellow group members in a dynamically technological manner.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bradley, Claire","Weiss, Mimi","Davies, Caroline","Holley, Debbie"],"dc:date":"2011-05-24T14:53:13Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.536488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46811,"sim:weight":0.524675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26288,"sim:weight":0.512197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26502,"sim:weight":0.495165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68238,"sim:weight":0.488117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.448615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47373,"sim:weight":0.444822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381991,"sim:weight":0.442213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48345,"sim:weight":0.43051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27100,"sim:weight":0.409167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.404733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99358,"sim:weight":0.400176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.382906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.367311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.365765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.361905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270152,"sim:weight":0.355867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269918,"sim:weight":0.35371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67048,"sim:weight":0.349708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383671,"sim:weight":0.33271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":113937,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Effect of positive and negative defocus on contrast sensitivity in myopes and non-myopes","bibo:abstract":"This study investigated the effect of lens induced defocus on the contrast sensitivity function in myopes and non-myopes. Contrast sensitivity for up to 20 spatial frequencies ranging from 1 to 20 c/deg was measured with vertical sine wave gratings under cycloplegia at different levels of positive and negative defocus in myopes and non-myopes. In non-myopes the reduction in contrast sensitivity increased in a systematic fashion as the amount of defocus increased. This reduction was similar for positive and negative lenses of the same power (p\u003d0.474). Myopes showed a contrast sensitivity loss that was significantly greater with positive defocus compared to negative defocus (p\u003d0.001). The magnitude of the contrast sensitivity loss was also dependent on the spatial frequency tested for both positive and negative defocus. There was significantly greater contrast sensitivity loss in non-myopes than in myopes at low-medium spatial frequencies (1–8 c/deg) with negative defocus. Latent accommodation was ruled out as a contributor to this difference in myopes and non-myopes. In another experiment, ocular aberrations were measured under cycloplegia using a Shack–Hartmann aberrometer. Modulation transfer functions were calculated using the second order term for defocus as well as the fourth order Zernike term for spherical aberration. The theoretical maximal contrast sensitivity based on aberration data predicted the measured asymmetry in contrast sensitivity to positive and negative defocus that was observed in myopic subjects. The observed asymmetry in contrast sensitivity with positive and negative defocus in myopes may be linked to the altered accommodative response observed in this group.","bibo:AuthorList":["Radhakrishnan, Hema","Pardhan, Shahina","Calver, Richard I.","O\u0027Leary, Daniel J."],"dc:date":"2010-04-29T13:39:48Z","doi":"10.1016/j.visres.2004.03.007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":758946,"sim:weight":0.238342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360353,"sim:weight":0.189125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15010,"sim:weight":0.165394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44224,"sim:weight":0.138067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5532,"sim:weight":0.129028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28131,"sim:weight":0.113911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.101145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.100303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.0985394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.0985394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.0982002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.0982002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.0831192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.0822678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.0822678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14623,"sim:weight":0.0793996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":760727,"sim:weight":0.0747649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28130,"sim:weight":0.0746242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81367,"sim:weight":0.0694968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145979,"sim:weight":0.0686735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This phenomenon is popularly known as the “crowding effect”, and it has been intensely studied for photopic vision: little attention has been paid to the effect at lower light levels. The underlying basis of the crowding effect has recently provoked some conjecture, with Hess and colleagues claiming that a passive “physical” phenomenon may either wholly [Vis. Res. 40 (2000) 365], or partially [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A––Opt. Image Sci. Vis. 17 (2000) 1516], account for the effect. In order to investigate the crowding effect under scotopic conditions, we conducted scotopic frequency of seeing experiments for Landolt C targets presented both with, and without, flanking bars; the size of the targets was varied so that frequency of seeing curves could be derived for each stimulus condition. Our results suggest that the spatial extent of crowding is significantly less for scotopic vision than for photopic vision at the same eccentricity––furthermore the effect does not seem to scale in proportion to target size. We also compared the resulting empirical curves to those that would be predicted by the hypothesis of Hess and colleagues. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the scotopic crowding effect is caused by a passive physical process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Simunovic, Matthew P.","Calver, Richard I."],"dc:date":"2010-04-29T13:47:05Z","doi":"10.1016/j.visres.2003.11.019","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2710080,"sim:weight":0.223872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.194261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.194261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.19271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.188377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.184665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.183929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.183929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.175886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.175886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28131,"sim:weight":0.169583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98778,"sim:weight":0.150325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15024,"sim:weight":0.147798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45082,"sim:weight":0.145304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145979,"sim:weight":0.135398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383915,"sim:weight":0.132677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15010,"sim:weight":0.130781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26675,"sim:weight":0.12993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710600,"sim:weight":0.1285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98836,"sim:weight":0.123525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the absence of sustainable materials standards in UK Building Regulations, behaviour is influenced by a combination of sustainability assessment ratings (e.g. BREEAM and the Code for Sutainable Homes), waste regulations, landfill taxes and planning guidance. However, there is still a lot of work to be done to achieve consistent and widespread improved waste recovery performance and procurement of sustainable materials. This paper presents the authors\u0027 views on the efficacy of current drivers, supported by a case study analysis and pilot survey of industry views. Indicating gaps between rhetoric, aspiration and delivery, it compares UK policy, regulatory and voluntary drivers with approaches in the Netherlands and Germany.","bibo:AuthorList":["Odeleye, Dellé","Menzies, Brian"],"dc:date":"2011-12-06T12:34:29Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664638,"sim:weight":0.380374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103781,"sim:weight":0.362403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103312,"sim:weight":0.330975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.30197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9624008,"sim:weight":0.301475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.291624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1593953,"sim:weight":0.290352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664526,"sim:weight":0.28028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.276371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.275061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.275061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.275061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.275061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.275061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.275061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.275061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.275061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.275061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.275061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.275061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the groups, social workers discussed the process of coming to a decision in care proceedings (where decisions are made about the future care of a child where there are concerns about the care provided in the family of origin). It explores how social workers described themselves coming to conclusions about cases, and how they perceive the courts as doing so. Noting the need in such important proceedings both for thoroughness and for speed (for delay is likely to be harmful to children in need of a secure home), the authors consider ways in which decision-making might be distorted or delayed and discuss the perception of the social workers that some kinds of evidence are under- or overvalued by the courts. The authors conclude that, while it may seem that there is a trade-off between thoroughness and speed, this is not always the case and that factors that cause poor decision-making can also cause delay.","bibo:AuthorList":["Beckett, Chris","McKeigue, Bridget","Taylor, Hilary"],"dc:date":"2010-07-01T13:20:24Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2206.2006.00437.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":341025,"sim:weight":0.471865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44572,"sim:weight":0.407455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.388692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.37821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58509,"sim:weight":0.349277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43887,"sim:weight":0.347908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47604,"sim:weight":0.345884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654845,"sim:weight":0.33061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75625,"sim:weight":0.327375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83005,"sim:weight":0.319897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383611,"sim:weight":0.304928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83998,"sim:weight":0.298164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47016,"sim:weight":0.290718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17849,"sim:weight":0.284785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382095,"sim:weight":0.283727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43228,"sim:weight":0.273571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107345,"sim:weight":0.268192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2887,"sim:weight":0.26817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98713,"sim:weight":0.265194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.263008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Coming from a sociological perspective, the study focused on how a violent political conflict impacts on two groups of social workers who live and work in the same society, but are likely to have different views about it. Their actions, views, well-being, and values were researched in a context likely to test universal social work values. The findings document a high level of tension and anxiety generated for both groups, very negative impact on clients’ life and views, largely negative effect on welfare services, co-existing with continuous professional\ndevelopment. Social workers’ views of their own national group and the other national\ngroup within the Intifada context highlight primarily the empathy with one’s own group\nwhile lacking in empathy towards the other group, coupled with suspicion and some\nhostility.

Despite its significance for social work (and other helping professions), there is a dearth of research on the subject. The authors construct a research framework which encapsulates the complexity and ambiguity of the issues at stake and three parallel empirical studies, which follow this framework, are presented. The findings highlight the burden of working and living in a violent political conflict, not just for service users but also for social workers. Emotional stress, fear, competing national and religious identities, yet some indication of resilience, are key findings from these studies. A number of moral and professional dilemmas emerged across all three studies, often testing loyalty to universal social work values. Thus, some respondents at times found it difficult to deal with colleagues and service users who were perceived to be ‘the enemy’. These studies highlight the need to raise the consciousness of social workers, agencies and policies about such issues in a world which is increasingly afflicted by violent political conflict. Support, education and training for social workers which transcend national contexts and further international research in this important area are recommended.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ramon, Shulamit","Campbell, Jim","Lindsay, Jane","McCrystal, Patrick","Baidoun, Naimeh"],"dc:date":"2010-07-21T15:29:38Z","doi":"10.1093/bjsw","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1351922,"sim:weight":0.361794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.344995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101283,"sim:weight":0.343443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106355,"sim:weight":0.309592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.281926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709935,"sim:weight":0.259714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.258839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100444,"sim:weight":0.255007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.24738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48367,"sim:weight":0.247296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43727,"sim:weight":0.235278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.233375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53693,"sim:weight":0.232188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.231709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101374,"sim:weight":0.224718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107298,"sim:weight":0.224177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43687,"sim:weight":0.216974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.21556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43408,"sim:weight":0.210295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101178,"sim:weight":0.20625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

When unaware of one’s emotions, they are: (a) not able to enter into one’s deliberations about what to do, and (b) more likely to be automatically acted out. This is a problem for rationality because (partly due to the logic of signal detection theory) emotional action urges are often “false positives”. In contrast, awareness of emotions crucially allows emotional responses to be inhibited: such inhibition is necessary for truly rational action selection. Furthermore, awareness enables Reflective Revision—the modification of one’s theories and action plans as a result of awareness of inconsistencies between theories and data, and action plans and goals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lambie, John A."],"dc:date":"2010-07-22T11:02:27Z","doi":"10.1016/j.concog.2007.03.005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":717279,"sim:weight":0.402814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":633097,"sim:weight":0.364103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653688,"sim:weight":0.355003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98629,"sim:weight":0.33353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82088,"sim:weight":0.327307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99136,"sim:weight":0.325571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":700585,"sim:weight":0.292536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384779,"sim:weight":0.269987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3217,"sim:weight":0.26823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101606,"sim:weight":0.264564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101596,"sim:weight":0.254214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47157,"sim:weight":0.248234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.216602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.215969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.215018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103052,"sim:weight":0.20734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":633057,"sim:weight":0.201434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44865,"sim:weight":0.193545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46580,"sim:weight":0.192107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.186813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This reply summarizes Lambie and Marcel\u0027s usages of the term self and examines both Dalgleish and Power\u0027s gloss of these and their own usages. This indicates that their own central usage of the term misrepresents Lambie and Marcel and is itself an improper usage. More important, examination of the phenomena claimed to require multiple selves suggests that they do not and that Dalgleish and Power may have misread the relevant clinical literature. Finally, Lambie and Marcel\u0027s own conception of dissociative phenomena and multiple selves are outlined, and alternative approaches are sketched.

Repressors, low-anxious, high-anxious, and defensive high-anxious individuals were asked to give a public presentation, and then given the opportunity to avoid the presentation. Repressors were the group most likely to avoid giving the presentation, but were the least likely to give an emotional explanation for their avoidance. By contrast, they were not less likely than other groups to provide negative emotional explanations of another person’s behaviour in a film clip. We concluded that: (1) repressors are impaired in self- but not in other-explanation using emotion, implying that “simulation” is not the method used by repressors to ground their folk psychology, (2) the intentional avoidance shown by repressors is indicative of some intact first-order phenomenal anxiety experience but that they lack second-order awareness of this anxiety experience.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lambie, John A.","Baker, Kevin L."],"dc:date":"2010-07-22T11:33:18Z","doi":"10.1075/ce.4.1.03lam","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":80956,"sim:weight":0.249191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26616,"sim:weight":0.236055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708615,"sim:weight":0.233905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29032,"sim:weight":0.228192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24368,"sim:weight":0.217493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23467,"sim:weight":0.204469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1118015,"sim:weight":0.197166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99071,"sim:weight":0.188477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98629,"sim:weight":0.187915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631699,"sim:weight":0.17818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269342,"sim:weight":0.171753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43930,"sim:weight":0.165528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23272,"sim:weight":0.165454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269941,"sim:weight":0.164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23851,"sim:weight":0.155994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47157,"sim:weight":0.155961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.154732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710080,"sim:weight":0.152887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22707,"sim:weight":0.150747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710078,"sim:weight":0.141545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In an attempt to address the negative consequences of stress in the workplace, a collaborative Participatory Action Research project (PAR), involving two large organizations, namely a Healthcare Trust and a Social Services Organization in the United Kingdom (England) was conducted. The project involved a team of professionals from Anglia Polytechnic University working with senior managers and employees of a health care organization and latterly with managers of a Social Services Organization (SSD) to develop a mental well-being strategy in each of these workplaces. This involved organizing and running of a series of five workshops in each of the two organizations and additionally surveys to determine the extent of the problem on staff and effects on their working and personal lives. An overview of the processes and reflective critique of the strengths and weaknesses of participatory action research methodology is provided. The short, medium and long-term strategies formulated by the active engagement of staff in the workshops, and the challenges in delivering and responding to these issues are carefully detailed. Recommendations are made for future collaborative work within hierarchical organizations and more importantly, the implications of delayed response to governmental policies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Munn-Giddings, Carol","Hart, C.","Ramon, Shulamit"],"dc:date":"2010-07-27T11:21:11Z","doi":"10.1080/09540260500238546","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5941,"sim:weight":0.33755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101178,"sim:weight":0.319264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.30847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1655098,"sim:weight":0.301541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.293232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.280966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.27348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90435,"sim:weight":0.270613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.268815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.268557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":932373,"sim:weight":0.261235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101625,"sim:weight":0.260448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.256329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.255867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.252056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.252056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.252056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.252056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.252056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.252056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article presents findings from a doctoral study with two self-help/mutual aid groups for carers in South-East England. The data are drawn from semistructured interviews with 15 active members which explored reasons for joining, benefits derived from membership, and perceived differences between support gained by membership and their relationship with professionals. Most group members had prior experience of voluntary work/activity, which influenced their decision to join, often prompted by a failure of the \u0027usual\u0027 support network of family/friends to cope or adjust to the carer\u0027s needs. Members reported personal gains of empathy, emotional information, experiential knowledge and practical information, based on a core value of reciprocity through peer support. It is this latter benefit that sets apart membership of self-help groups from groups supported by professionals who may not appreciate the scope and breadth of carers\u0027 responsibilities, or of the importance of their relationship with the person for whom they care. In this way, self-help groups offered additional, but not alternative, \u0027space\u0027 that enabled members to transcend their traditional role as a \u0027carer\u0027. It is concluded that self-help/mutual aid groups, based on reciprocal peer support, offer a valuable type of resource in the community that is not replicable in professional–client relations. The findings have contemporary relevance given the raft of new policies which value the experiential knowledge built by both individual and collectives of carers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Munn-Giddings, Carol","McVicar, Andrew J."],"dc:date":"2010-07-22T15:25:35Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2524.2006.00660.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"C Munn-Giddings and A McVicar.

Two approaches were employed. Firstly, reflectance of monochromatic wavebands at 330 and 680 nm was measured for a total of 45 different species covering a wide range of genera. In the second, specific leaf types that displayed different degrees of reflectance were treated to remove hairs and waxes that contributed to their reflectance. Selected waxy and non-waxy leaves were also studied in more detail over the spectral range 270–500 nm. It was found that both pubescence (presence of hairs) and glaucousness (presence of a thick epicuticular wax layer) had marked effects on total reflectance. Pubescent leaves tended to be more effective in reflecting longer wavelengths than ultraviolet radiation. The extent of this effect depended on hair type. Glaucous leaves demonstrated that surface waxes were very effective reflectors of both UV and longer wavelength radiation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holmes, M.

Despite this, there is one unifying concept relevant to all such parasitic associations: Both pathogen and host adapt to maximize their own reproductive output and ultimate fitness. The strategies adopted by pathogens and hosts to achieve this goal are almost as diverse as the organisms themselves, but studies examining such relationships have traditionally concentrated only on aspects of host physiology. Here we review examples of host-altered behavior and consider these within a broad ecological and evolutionary context. Research on pathogen-induced and host-mediated behavioral changes demonstrates the range of altered behaviors exhibited by invertebrates including behaviorally induced fever, elevation seeking, reduced or increased activity, reduced response to semiochemicals, and changes in reproductive behavior. These interactions are sometimes quite bizarre, intricate, and of great scientific interest.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roy, Helen E.","Steinkraus, D.C.","Eilenberg, Joergen","Hajek, A.E.","Pell, Judith K."],"dc:date":"2010-07-28T11:48:40Z","doi":"10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.150941","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":61800,"sim:weight":0.349707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":897588,"sim:weight":0.294764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47433,"sim:weight":0.253158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":778969,"sim:weight":0.232885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":539609,"sim:weight":0.218362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":537702,"sim:weight":0.207092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48712,"sim:weight":0.191038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99116,"sim:weight":0.180222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18950,"sim:weight":0.165295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77652,"sim:weight":0.146957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97721,"sim:weight":0.138907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386539,"sim:weight":0.135719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934499,"sim:weight":0.13394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.126533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28937,"sim:weight":0.124717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573682,"sim:weight":0.12334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43114,"sim:weight":0.121904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643700,"sim:weight":0.121254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.121129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.121129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The ability of coccinellids to vector conidia from a colony of E. neoaphidis -infected pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, to a colony of uninfected A. pisum was demonstrated in a laboratory study. Adult coccinellids which had previously foraged on plants infested with different densities of sporulating cadavers (1, 5, 15, 30 cadavers per plant) initiated infection in a proportion of uninfected pea aphids (4, 0, 2 and 8%, respectively) when subsequently allowed to forage on A. pisum infested bean plants. Further laboratory studies demonstrated that fourth instar larvae and adult coccinellids artificially inoculated with conidia initiated infection in 11 and 13% of an A. pisum population in which they foraged, respectively. Furthermore, a proportion of A. pisum placed on bean plants which had previously been foraged on by inoculated larval and adult coccinellids also died from infection (3 and 10% of A. pisum, respectively). However, although coccinellid adults inoculated with conidia initiated infection in 19% of A. pisum, cereal aphids, S. avenae , exposed to the inoculated coccinellids did not become infected. A further laboratory study demonstrated that infection of A. pisum only occurred if inoculated coccinellids were transferred to A. pisum populations immediately post inoculation. However, a proportion of A. pisum placed on bean plants which had been foraged on by inoculated coccinellids transferred 0, 4 and 24 h post inoculation died from infection (9, 3 and 7%, respectively). A field study further demonstrated the potential of coccinellids to vector E. neoaphidis. Single spring sown field bean plants (Long Hoos Experimental Plots, IACRRothamsted Farm) were enclosed within nylon mesh bags and 25 adult A. pisum were added to each bag with one of the following treatments: no further addition (control), coccinellid adult (control), inoculated coccinellid adult, inoculated A. pisum or sporulating A. pisum cadavers. No aphids died of E. neoaphidis in the control treatments; 5, 16 and 33% of aphids were infected with E. neoaphidis on the other treatments, respectively.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roy, Helen E.","Pell, Judith K.","Alderson, P.G."],"dc:date":"2010-07-28T13:09:05Z","doi":"10.1080/09583150020029781","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":386539,"sim:weight":0.385307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1094722,"sim:weight":0.311153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59517,"sim:weight":0.277003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":856903,"sim:weight":0.265141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64009,"sim:weight":0.254244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710588,"sim:weight":0.25392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":267124,"sim:weight":0.244636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1138886,"sim:weight":0.208089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":677443,"sim:weight":0.205148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387084,"sim:weight":0.19338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47071,"sim:weight":0.183374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26918,"sim:weight":0.181628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99122,"sim:weight":0.167368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18950,"sim:weight":0.141112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64015,"sim:weight":0.136273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63367,"sim:weight":0.135443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18949,"sim:weight":0.132776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":953583,"sim:weight":0.130037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56373,"sim:weight":0.122566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63388,"sim:weight":0.118715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Mean distance facility was significantly lower (9.7 cycles per minute (cpm)) in the myopic group compared with the mean distance facility in the emmetropic group (15.6 cpm; p \u003c0.005). There was no significant difference in the near facilities of the two groups (11.5 cpm in myopes vs 12.9 cpm in emmetropes). Positive accommodation response time for distance vision was greater than 4 s in 45% of myopes and in 9% of emmetropes.

The validity of the PowerRefractor and the Nidek autorefractor readings were determined by comparing them to subjective refraction. Measurements of refractive error were obtained from the two instruments on two separate occasions to assess their repeatability. The measured refractive error was converted into a dioptric power matrix for data analysis. No significant difference was found between the measurements obtained with the two instruments and the subjective refraction. The estimate of refractive error given by the two instruments was also found to be repeatable.

All were young adults, and refractive error in the myopes was corrected with soft contact lenses. Monocular accommodative facility measurements were taken for a 40-cm and a 6-m working distance with +2.00/–2.00-D and Plano/–2.00-D flippers, respectively. Subjective facility was recorded with automated flippers and objective measurements of dynamic accommodation response were simultaneously taken with a photorefractor. \nRESULTS: Subjective and objective facility measurements showed a significantly lower facility rate in myopes when compared with emmetropes at distance (P \u003c 0.05) but not at near (P \u003e 0.05). The response amplitude of accommodation during facility tasks was found to be similar in the two refractive groups. However, the velocity of accommodation was found to be lower in myopes than in emmetropes for distance facility (P \u003c 0.05) but not for near facility (P \u003e 0.05). Velocity of disaccommodation was lower in myopes than in emmetropes at both distance and near (P \u003c 0.05). \nCONCLUSIONS: During distance accommodative facility testing, myopes exhibited a lower velocity of accommodation and disaccommodation, which led to a lower distance accommodative facility rate. For near facility measurements, however, although velocity of disaccommodation was lower in myopes, velocity of accommodation was found to be similar in the two refractive groups. A variety of factors that contribute to these differences are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Radhakrishnan, Hema","Allen, Peter M.","Charman, W.

The functions were: amplitude of accommodation; monocular and binocular accommodative facility (6 m and 40 cm); monocular and binocular accommodative response to target distance; AC/A and CA/C ratios, tonic accommodation (dark focus and pinhole), accommodative hysteresis, and nearwork-induced transient myopia. Within groups of related accommodative functions (such as facility measures or open-loop measures) measurements on individuals were generally significantly correlated, however correlations between functions from different groups were generally not significant. Although accommodative amplitude and pinhole (open loop) accommodation were significantly different in myopes than in non-myopes, these functions were unrelated to myopia progression. Facility of accommodation and accommodative lag was independent predictors of myopia progression.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allen, Peter M.","O\u0027Leary, Daniel J."],"dc:date":"2010-07-29T15:11:29Z","doi":"10.1016/j.visres.2005.05.007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":566112,"sim:weight":0.634537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360353,"sim:weight":0.601496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":760727,"sim:weight":0.5179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14623,"sim:weight":0.369385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360481,"sim:weight":0.258728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15010,"sim:weight":0.153725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":758946,"sim:weight":0.126559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28130,"sim:weight":0.12447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15012,"sim:weight":0.101726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.089268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.0834885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":544689,"sim:weight":0.0802287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.0779115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.061891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The 10.6 km2 Sompting catchment has been monitored over the 12-year period 1990/91–2001/02. A housing estate at the lower end of the catchment that was frequently inundated by muddy floods in the late 1980s and early 1990s has not been flooded since the winter of 1993/94, even during the heavy rainfall events of October and November 2000. This is a result of the ameliorative measures put in place in the early 1990s, primarily the reversion of some winter cereal fields to permanent grassland (set-aside). Other land management changes helped, for example, some parts of the catchment were put down to short-term grass leys and small dams were constructed to impound runoff. Flooding of the housing estate occurred when more than 30% of the catchment was covered by eroded fields, which contributed runoff to the valley floors leading down to the housing estate. The length of continuous down-valley flow was greater in the early 1990s compared with later years. The introduction of grassland reduced the risk of flooding not only by reducing the area contributing to runoff, but also by stopping valley floor flows linking up. Such measures to alleviate runoff, erosion and flooding fit well with policies proposed in the recent report by the UK Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food.","bibo:AuthorList":["Evans, Robert","Boardman, John"],"dc:date":"2010-08-03T10:26:25Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1475-2743.2003.tb00308.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":61891,"sim:weight":0.330199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60643,"sim:weight":0.329956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61892,"sim:weight":0.329312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61893,"sim:weight":0.322858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61890,"sim:weight":0.319598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270120,"sim:weight":0.317935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63007,"sim:weight":0.310413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61876,"sim:weight":0.303491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61875,"sim:weight":0.300805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61637,"sim:weight":0.2966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61874,"sim:weight":0.296463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61877,"sim:weight":0.295673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62704,"sim:weight":0.291142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61878,"sim:weight":0.279509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61980,"sim:weight":0.277329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61873,"sim:weight":0.27645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61885,"sim:weight":0.267231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999567,"sim:weight":0.266392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":359903,"sim:weight":0.25737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61889,"sim:weight":0.247439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Family court mediation offers a gateway for social work with children and families whose needs are largely left untouched by current services, and could thereby play an important part within the broader extension of prevention, early intervention, parenting and support services recommended by government. Over the past two decades, mediation has become a popular approach to reducing conflict and resolving disputes in a wide range of inter-personal, community and organizational settings. Given the professional interest that social workers have in helping their clients achieve more harmonious lives, the space for mediation would appear considerable and yet the connections between mediation and social work are, as yet, insufficiently mapped and analysed, in terms of both theory and practice.

Through the lens of current teaching and learning of communication skills it is the contention of this article that social work education needs systematically to address its strategy for replying to the\nchallenge of a greater focus on practice skills.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dinham, Adam"],"dc:date":"2010-08-05T09:35:52Z","doi":"10.1080/02615470600915894","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52832,"sim:weight":0.551222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709779,"sim:weight":0.494278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1923111,"sim:weight":0.470246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104853,"sim:weight":0.43806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.435784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709935,"sim:weight":0.389736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1560,"sim:weight":0.387841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387150,"sim:weight":0.377331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341327,"sim:weight":0.372405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.366311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26502,"sim:weight":0.346137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.346074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709775,"sim:weight":0.343737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.341037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.339042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.337471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.33529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88253,"sim:weight":0.331959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55530,"sim:weight":0.328114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106355,"sim:weight":0.32565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At the same time, ‘participation’ has become central in debates and practices about community life in general and neighbourhood renewal in particular. This article explores the relationship between well-being and participation in disadvantaged areas. Drawing on primary research in two New Deal for Communities (NDC) areas in the United Kingdom, I explore how local people\u0027s expectations of participation in NDC are disappointed and how that disappointment may pose a key risk to well-being. I propose, therefore, that experiences of participation in areas of neighbourhood renewal threaten levels of well-being in the very disadvantaged areas where it is most needed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dinham, Adam"],"dc:date":"2010-08-05T11:19:36Z","doi":"10.1093/cdj","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43845,"sim:weight":0.382244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931194,"sim:weight":0.328318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103736,"sim:weight":0.3248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.301103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93880,"sim:weight":0.288047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95997,"sim:weight":0.287277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95759,"sim:weight":0.270435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66579,"sim:weight":0.268363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1395069,"sim:weight":0.252639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95737,"sim:weight":0.251074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1347928,"sim:weight":0.234923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.233115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66261,"sim:weight":0.230383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55307,"sim:weight":0.217599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.213183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":261048,"sim:weight":0.211517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.203545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44343,"sim:weight":0.20306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341217,"sim:weight":0.1978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98489,"sim:weight":0.192726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":113998,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Client and family narratives on schizophrenia","bibo:abstract":"This qualitative study explored the narratives used by clients and family members to explain the process of developing schizophrenia. Specifically, the research questions addressed the narratives used to explain the development of schizophrenia, how this impacted on the client’s sense of self and social relationships over time and how the narratives used by health professionals had contributed to this ‘sense making’ process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight clients of a\nrehabilitation and continuing care service and eight close relatives of these people. Interview narratives were analyzed using primarily data-driven techniques derived from grounded theory. The narratives produced a temporal model of the experience of schizophrenia over time.

Samuel Bamford is the only poet known to have been present at Peterloo, but he is mainly known for his autobiography, not for his verse.

Where it looks at international anti-fascist cooperation,\nit mostly concentrates on politically motivated initiatives (for example the writers’ congresses in 1934 and 1935, in Moscow and Paris respectively), or on the activities of a few central organisations, such as the PEN Club or the American Guild for German Cultural Freedom.\nThis essay broadens the focus of exile research by arguing that Klaus Mann, with\nhis journal Die Sammlung, attempted to achieve international anti-fascist cooperation – cultural as well as political – an aspect that has so far been neglected even by researchers who focus particularly on Mann. The study fills this gap by investigating the international dimension of Die Sammlung. It shows that Mann intended to produce more than the ‘Dokumente einer ohnm¨achtigen Opposition’ (Hans-Albrecht\nWalter) that exile journals usually formed. Instead, he aimed at providing an\ninternational platform for intellectuals from many countries, as well as a literary\nand political journal by and for German exiles. In this respect, Die Sammlung was not\nonly a precursor of Mann’s own 1940s English-language journal Decision, but also a unique endeavour amongst the journals of German exile.","bibo:AuthorList":["von Lindeiner, Karina"],"dc:date":"2010-09-14T11:04:10Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1468-0483.2007.00383.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18187,"sim:weight":0.342472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46780,"sim:weight":0.232633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43568,"sim:weight":0.212366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383607,"sim:weight":0.208909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99110,"sim:weight":0.198141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.172687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664712,"sim:weight":0.167344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387337,"sim:weight":0.162077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.157646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45508,"sim:weight":0.15186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46907,"sim:weight":0.151099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383512,"sim:weight":0.14185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43304,"sim:weight":0.139204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383497,"sim:weight":0.13653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387104,"sim:weight":0.135357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.134615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48382,"sim:weight":0.131066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99435,"sim:weight":0.128189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99504,"sim:weight":0.124755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383616,"sim:weight":0.124293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Tattooing creates a new surface of potential significance upon the body. Tattooing can call into question concepts of volition in reference to the power to inscribe and define one’s subjectivity through one’s own skin, and the social defining of the subject. Skin is the involution or event between subject and object, will and cultural inscription, the social and the self. Feminism, particularly corporeal feminists, have attempted to think ways in which the female flesh may be recognized and self-defined without risking essentialism through reification of the meaning of ‘woman’s body’. Thinking the tattooed female body thus resonates with some of the risks and benefits feminism has found in theorizing a marginalized body.  Using Deleuze, Guattari, Lyotard and other major influences on corporeal feminists this article explores ways in which significance is sought in skin and possible configurations of skin and world which challenge the desire to read the flesh as a legible incarnation of subjectivity.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacCormack, Patricia"],"dc:date":"2010-09-14T13:59:43Z","doi":"10.1177/1357034X06064321","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(1993).

The relation of cinesexuality to feminism will then be drawn, using Guattari’s notion of asemiotic bodies: the ‘homosexual’ and ‘woman’. This will be followed by some brief sketches toward thinking cinesexuality as a form of ‘becoming-woman’. The cinesexual emphasises cinematic pleasure as asignified, pleasure beyond signification that then challenges how genders, and indeed individuals as their own collective of disparate modalities, desire cinema.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacCormack, Patricia"],"dc:date":"2010-09-14T15:48:21Z","doi":"10.1080/09574040500321396","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":114063,"sim:weight":0.447966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":114060,"sim:weight":0.428624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":114065,"sim:weight":0.398284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47198,"sim:weight":0.358514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98567,"sim:weight":0.261439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931412,"sim:weight":0.242585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9340162,"sim:weight":0.196325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45046,"sim:weight":0.192073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65193,"sim:weight":0.184239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43837,"sim:weight":0.183772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48234,"sim:weight":0.183471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1663309,"sim:weight":0.173378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88755,"sim:weight":0.16605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710177,"sim:weight":0.165694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352161,"sim:weight":0.151641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45196,"sim:weight":0.134368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000469,"sim:weight":0.128981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66161,"sim:weight":0.12718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383588,"sim:weight":0.124801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88735,"sim:weight":0.121642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article excavates the ways in which thinking desire through perversion can renegotiate how we think the body and subjectivity. By actively repudiating dominant paradigms of sexuality it is possible to understand subjectivity as flux, perversion as political and the body defined by its capacity to dissipate and refigure socio-sexual limits. Perversion is not simply against the normal but comes to present a means by which subjectivity may become-otherwise according to Deleuze and Guattari. Considering woman’s historical definition as the ‘perverted’ version of the male (be it castrated, maternal or otherwise), actively engaging in becoming-perverse calls for all subjects to negotiate the political potentials and risks of defining sexual habituation. Occupying the non-dominant position does not necessarily align one with being pervert, however this article will suggest perversion can be used as a means by which those in othered positions, and indeed all subjects, can volitionally explore the position of the other. Perversion is not that which one is named but can be a sexual-political project one undertakes.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacCormack, Patricia"],"dc:date":"2010-09-20T11:09:19Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Seyla Benhabib.

Measurements were obtained at the fovea and at four different eccentric retinal locations. Each eccentric retinal location was 8° from the fovea, one on the horizontal axis (180°), and the other three in the superior field on retinal axes of 90°, 45° and 135°. For the superior and horizontal retinal locations, the orientations of the gratings tested were horizontal (180°) and vertical (90°). For the retinal points on the oblique axes, the orientations of the gratings were 45° and 135°. Measurements were also obtained at the fovea for all four different grating orientations at both levels of contrast. Recognition threshold was defined as the highest spatial frequency at which luminance gratings were perceived veridically. At the fovea, binocular summation ratios (binocular spatial frequency/monocular spatial frequency) showed no significant differences for gratings of either contrast levels or for any orientation (p\u003e0.05). In the superior periphery, significantly higher summation ratios were shown by low contrast vertical gratings (p\u003c0.05), and in the horizontal periphery by low contrast horizontal gratings (p\u003c0.05). On the oblique axis, low contrast gratings that were parallel to the oblique meridian showed higher summation ratios compared to those at right angles to it. High contrast gratings, at least at 8° eccentricity, did not show this effect. Data suggest that meridional organisation of the retina (e.g. vertical gratings seen maximally in the superior field) occurs for resolution and that it is evidenced closer to the fovea than previously shown.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pardhan, Shahina"],"dc:date":"2010-11-02T13:58:42Z","doi":"10.1016/S0042-6989","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":28261,"sim:weight":0.37439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28492,"sim:weight":0.361497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28490,"sim:weight":0.336425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28130,"sim:weight":0.328364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28380,"sim:weight":0.313117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707762,"sim:weight":0.270545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.252176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28491,"sim:weight":0.248964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.246295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.246295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.244385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.244385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.24263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.218722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.218722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28131,"sim:weight":0.216222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.210766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98979,"sim:weight":0.19468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15024,"sim:weight":0.191605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707761,"sim:weight":0.188554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The measurement of contrast detection in noise allows any given loss in visual sensitivity to be attributed to two components namely sampling efficiency and/or equivalent noise. Previous work has also shown that sampling efficiency gives an indication of the neural effects and in the absence of sampling efficiency changes, changes in equivalent noise levels are considered to be due to optical factors. We investigate whether the asymmetrical loss shown by myopes to defocus can be explained by changes in sampling efficiency or equivalent noise, or both.\n\nMethods: Contrast thresholds in four different levels of externally added noise were measured in five myopic and five non-myopic subjects for Gabors of 3 c/deg. Measurements were obtained under cycloplegia with 0 D, ±0.50 D, and ±1.00 D defocusing lenses. RMS wavefront aberrations were also measured using a Shack-Hartmann aberrometer.\n\nResults: In the absence of noise, there was no significant difference in contrast sensitivity without defocus between myopes and emmetropes. When sampling efficiency and equivalent noise were measured from Contrast Detection in Noise functions, analysis of variance showed no significant difference in sampling efficiency between myopes and non-myopes (p \u003d 0.145). Myopes showed maximum levels of equivalent noise with +1.00 D defocus, decreasing to a minimum with −1.00 D defocus (p \u003d 0.009). Non-myopes showed a symmetrical increase in equivalent noise from zero for both positive and negative defocus. A significant correlation was found between equivalent noise and the total RMS of Wavefront aberrations of the eye (p \u003d 0.026).\n\nConclusion: Optical factors explain the observed differences in contrast sensitivity with positive and negative defocus between myopes and non-myopes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Radhakrishnan, Hema","Pardhan, Shahina"],"dc:date":"2010-11-02T14:14:29Z","doi":"10.1016/j.visres.2006.03.001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1925702,"sim:weight":0.237018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15010,"sim:weight":0.190136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28131,"sim:weight":0.181102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360353,"sim:weight":0.174741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44224,"sim:weight":0.166915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5532,"sim:weight":0.143575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22532,"sim:weight":0.139484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54114,"sim:weight":0.136589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27922,"sim:weight":0.13288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.130248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.130248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.124923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.122533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.122533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.121213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394924,"sim:weight":0.118256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98680,"sim:weight":0.112751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.109202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.107952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.107952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

METHODS: Manual data analysis and QSR NUD*IST Vivo were used to analyse the data generated by individual and focus group interviews and the critical incident technique with 32 qualified nurses working in an acute hospital setting in the UK. RESULTS: The participants identified a number of issues related to the theme of empowerment. These included the nurse as patient informer, psychological supporter and rapport builder and the concepts of informed choice/decision making, gatekeeping, coping, patient assertiveness, self-esteem and confidence. CONCLUSION: Empowerment is a complex, multi-dimensional, contested concept which can reflect a broad socio-political agenda, a radical emancipatory process or, as the findings from this qualitative study suggest, pragmatic interventions operating within the confines of a slightly modified medical model. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: If the reader deems the findings are transferable to their clinical milieu then the implications for practice relate to the need for careful consideration about empowerment in relation to operational definitions for practice, how terminology and related intervention is contextualised and the relationship between pragmatic empowerment and the medical paradigm.","bibo:AuthorList":["Piper, Stewart"],"dc:date":"2010-10-19T10:09:02Z","doi":"10.1016/j.pec.2009.09.032","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2005).

However, application has been more limited in species exposed exclusively to oceanic waters, where gradients in physical and chemical properties are less extreme. To test whether otolith elemental signatures record spatial information in an oceanic species, we sampled otoliths from Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) and used an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) coupled to a laser ablation system to target the outer otolith edges corresponding to the period immediately before capture. Using multivariate analysis of variance and multivariate discriminant analysis, we found that edge signatures discriminated toothfish by geographic region with near complete success: only 5% of fish caught off South America and in the Antarctic were misclassified to sampling areas in the other region. Moreover, edge signatures showed strong differences between sampling areas within each region: fish captured off South America classified to sampling areas therein with 79%–84% success, and Antarctic fish classified to sampling areas therein with 50%–67% success. These results compare favourably with rates of classification for estuarine-dependent fish, demonstrating that otolith elemental signatures can discriminate the geographic provenance of oceanic and estuarine-dependent fish.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ashford, Julian R.","Jones, Cynthia M.","Hofmann, Eileen E.","Everson, Inigo","Moreno, Carlos A.","Duhamel, Guy","Williams, Richard"],"dc:date":"2010-10-14T11:05:23Z","doi":"10.1139/f05-191","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":980333,"sim:weight":0.507468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1090693,"sim:weight":0.476557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64208,"sim:weight":0.231966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31142,"sim:weight":0.181489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55410,"sim:weight":0.171459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.165865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32132,"sim:weight":0.161169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88210,"sim:weight":0.160885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84623,"sim:weight":0.159008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269887,"sim:weight":0.150857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826655,"sim:weight":0.14882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31144,"sim:weight":0.148315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494504,"sim:weight":0.14759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.137481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.137481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48406,"sim:weight":0.136357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62510,"sim:weight":0.132732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29767,"sim:weight":0.127916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.121239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.114647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, such claims have rarely been subjected to robust outcome research. This paper reports outcomes from a survey of 44 female and 18 male new art project participants attending 22 art projects in England, carried out as part of a national evaluation. Outcomes were quantified through self-completed questionnaires on first entry to the project, during January to March of 2006, and 6 months later. The questionnaires included three measures: empowerment, mental health [Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE)] and social inclusion. Paired t-tests were used to compare overall change, and mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance to compare subgroups, including age, gender, educational\nlevel, mental health and level of participation. Results showed significant improvements in\nempowerment (P\u003d 0.01), mental health (P\u003d 0.03) and social inclusion (P\u003d 0.01). Participants\nwith higher CORE scores, no new stress in their lives and positive impressions of the impact\nof arts on their life benefited most over all three measures. Positive impressions of the impact\nof arts were significantly associated with improvement on all three measures, but the largest\neffect was for empowerment (P\u003d 0.002) rather than mental health or social inclusion. This\nstudy suggests that arts participation positively benefits people with mental health difficulties.\nArts participation increased levels of empowerment and had potential to impact on mental health and social inclusion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hacking, Sue","Secker, Jenny","Spandler, Helen","Kent, Lyn","Shenton, Jo"],"dc:date":"2010-11-11T15:59:44Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2524.2008.00789.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":363904,"sim:weight":0.64228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98489,"sim:weight":0.394955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1663875,"sim:weight":0.394227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80867,"sim:weight":0.326139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709866,"sim:weight":0.309116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998639,"sim:weight":0.300127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.271606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708124,"sim:weight":0.256942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99436,"sim:weight":0.24487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26078,"sim:weight":0.243276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23452,"sim:weight":0.226586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710227,"sim:weight":0.213202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18046,"sim:weight":0.208305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.208227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46641,"sim:weight":0.196811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.188739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66883,"sim:weight":0.18805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.186528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.184532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.182388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Based on a comparison of ways of defining social exclusion with the mental health literature, this article begins by outlining a social systems approach to understanding social exclusion. The approach is later used to examine the position of people with mental health needs in the UK. First, however, a common assumption that social inclusion constitutes the opposite of social exclusion is addressed and an alternative way of thinking about the two concepts is put forward. A further assumption that social inclusion is self-evidently desirable is also critiqued from political and service user perspectives before drawing conclusions from the evidence reviewed. These concern a need for policy initiatives to focus on tackling the structural barriers that work to exclude people with mental health needs, as well as on challenging the deep-rooted prejudice and stigmatisation that reinforce those barriers; and a need to be mindful of the context in which inclusion policies are implemented, the assumptions that become implicit within these policies, and the possible consequences of their adoption as a moral imperative.","bibo:AuthorList":["Secker, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2010-11-18T11:00:13Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.401279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18196,"sim:weight":0.383057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98489,"sim:weight":0.370764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.352872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351922,"sim:weight":0.342191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101381,"sim:weight":0.319324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.315229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.294271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106355,"sim:weight":0.287428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.28043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81239,"sim:weight":0.269608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43687,"sim:weight":0.267434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98709,"sim:weight":0.25473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43727,"sim:weight":0.253054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43845,"sim:weight":0.245812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664693,"sim:weight":0.244766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.233711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43534,"sim:weight":0.228497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.225617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710204,"sim:weight":0.225479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While unresolved\nboth in general and in nursing, a degree of theoretical convergence was established\nin the 1990s [Bunton, R., Macdonald, G., 1992. Health promotion: disciplines and\ndiversity.

Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. http://\nwww.who.int/hpr/archive/docs/ottawa.html]. For many of the participants in this\nstudy however, the meanings given to these concepts and the predominant use of\nhealth education were inconsistent with much of the language of the wider debate\nand this has potential implications for nurse education. For, if the findings are considered\ntransferable then there is a need to develop education strategies and curricula\nthat articulate the ideological foundations of policy and practice and to use\nmainstream terminology to assist nurses both to understand and contribute to the\ncontemporary health promotion debate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Piper, Stewart"],"dc:date":"2010-10-20T15:38:49Z","doi":"10.1016/j.nedt.2007.03.010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(1999).

{"identifier":114031,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Book chapter"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The child\u0027s perspective and service delivery","bibo:abstract":"Since the beginning of the 1990s there has been a drive towards involving children and young people in the development and delivery of public services in the UK. At no other time in our history has there been so much focus on enabling children and young people to participate in the lives of their communities. UK Government policies rhetorically stress that every opportunity must be taken to listen to the voices of the young and for their perspectives to be heard.\n\nAt the same time, children and young people are starting to take advantage of this change in thinking and are beginning to want to be part of the decision-making processes that govern their lives (Kirby and Bryson, 2002; Stafford et al., 2003; Hill et al., 2004). The children who took part in the Children’s Summit on Corporal Punishment in Sweden in 20011 reflect what many others have said:\n\nPoliticians often refer to us children as being the future of Europe. But we are living right now . . . Our childhood is happening now and not in the future. We do not think it is enough for decision-makers (for example politicians and public officials) to speak a lot about children and how important they are . . . We want them to listen to us. We want to see action!\n(Children’s Summit, Sweden 2001)\n\nHowever, though there is a growing trend in developed economies towards listening to children’s perspectives, a culture of non-participation in public life Introduction and in decision making about services is still the norm. What constitutes ‘participation’ by children is interpreted in many different ways. Often the degree to which  they are encouraged or enabled to participate depends largely on the attitude of adults around them and the interpretation those adults place on the term ‘participation’. As a result, the current focus in the UK on children’s participation runs the risk of being implemented in a meaningless way or not implemented at all.\n\nIf children’s ‘participation’ is to have substance, it will require those who work with children to seek to ensure children’s perspectives are taken into account when developing health and social care services. As the importance of promoting health in childhood is foregrounded, we may become more interested in finding out what children have to say about their own health. This chapter examines the case for children’s participation in service delivery and the policy drivers that underpin the current situation in the UK. Some of the barriers to participation are examined before moving on to a review of examples of children’s views about services.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moules, Tina","O\u0027Brien, Niamh"],"dc:date":"2010-11-11T14:14:44Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":106473,"sim:weight":0.613272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.609929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47369,"sim:weight":0.57396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109288,"sim:weight":0.561101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46504,"sim:weight":0.559761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77112,"sim:weight":0.531585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":799,"sim:weight":0.516948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.506258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.485949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.451198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17849,"sim:weight":0.444537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145629,"sim:weight":0.396826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50132,"sim:weight":0.392689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1349596,"sim:weight":0.3921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53847,"sim:weight":0.385817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52204,"sim:weight":0.374409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652016,"sim:weight":0.371502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52188,"sim:weight":0.366186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52200,"sim:weight":0.364738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382095,"sim:weight":0.363864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":114032,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Creative methods: problematics for inquiry and pedagogy in health and social care","bibo:abstract":"This article provides an overview of initial discussions emerging from the Creative Methods Network, an informal organisation concerned with the use of the creative arts in research, teaching and practice in health and social care. Key issues are presented and contextualised with regard to the current conditions in which health and social care research and education is practised. Our own discussions have come to question the seeming dominance of governance within professional education programmes in which there is a primary focus on developing technical skill and capacity.  Such governance often extends itself to the measurement of the implementation of these technical skills and this is set against concerns about the absence of creativity and the humanities in the educational programmes of caring for human beings. Consequently, the article reflects a view that the use of the creative arts and humanities in the education of the human caring professions is being eroded away in favour of technical-rational reasoning. It is argued that this then presents an important problem manifested in an emphasis on established and quantifiable knowledge transfer which inhibits other forms of knowledge generation. For the purposes of this discussion we have viewed this problem through the lenses offered by Foucault and Bourdieu.","bibo:AuthorList":["McIntosh, Paul","Sobiechowska, Paula"],"dc:date":"2010-10-28T11:39:54Z","doi":"10.2304/power.2009.1.3.295","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"I Percy.

The study, conducted in one acute National Health Service (NHS) Trust in Cambridgeshire, England, and completed in 2002, employed a prospective survey design. The research used a self-completion, pilot, postal questionnaire, including closed, open and scaled questions as the main method of data collection. From a total of 200 eligible patients, an unselected, consecutive sample of 142 in-patients consented to participate, of whom 103 returned the questionnaire—–a response rate of 73%. In contrast to much published literature, this study demonstrated that empowerment issues involving the rights of coronary care patients to be primary decision makers, managers of their illnesses and ultimate arbiters of their treatment and care were of minimal concern to all but a few. Almost 90% of patients were content to entrust their care exclusively to health professionals based on their confidence in the clinical expertise of the medical and nursing staff. Findings suggested that, while respondents were well-satisfied with their care, the ethos of patient empowerment was of peripheral concern and readily abdicated in the face of acute illness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lewin, David","Piper, Stewart"],"dc:date":"2010-10-26T13:06:57Z","doi":"10.1016/j.iccn.2006.09.003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Beattie.

How do the health care systems and the voluntary sectors affect the kinds of social changes that SHGs/SHOs make? \n\nMethodology/approach: A review of research on the role of SHGs/SHOs in contributing to national health social movements in the UK and US was made.  Case studies of the UK and the US compare the characteristics of their health care systems and their voluntary sector.  Research reviews of two community level self-help groups in each country describe the kinds of social changes they made.\n\nFindings: The research review verified that SHGs/SHOs contribute to national level health social movements for patient consumerism. The case studies showed that community level SHGs/SHOs successfully made the same social changes but on a smaller scale as the national movements, and the health care system affects the kinds of community changes made.\n\nResearch limitations: A limited number of SHGs/SHOs within only two societies were studied.  Additional SHGs/SHOs within a variety of societies need to be studied.\n\nOriginality/value of chapter\n\nCommunity SHGs/SHOs are often trivialized by social scientists as just inward-oriented support groups, but this chapter shows that local groups contribute to patient consumerism and social changes but in ways that depend on the kind of health care system and societal context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Borkman, Thomasina","Munn-Giddings, Carol"],"dc:date":"2010-10-28T09:47:49Z","doi":"10.1016/S1057-6290","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Boston Women’s.

To explore the experiences of care staff in managing long-term percutaneous\nendoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding regimes.\nBackground. Since its first description in 1980, PEG feeding has become a widelyused\ntechnique to provide enteral nutritional support. Its initial use for short term\nfeeding has subsequently been extended to encompass long-term care.\nMethods. A single institution case study, employing mixed methods, was conducted\nin one English nursing home. Data were collected from an unstructured interview,\nquestionnaires and a focus group in 2004–2005.\nResults. The two key concerns of care staff were found to relate to clinical issues,\nsuch as vomiting, and the ethical issues surrounding PEG insertion.\nConclusions. Care staff would value the creation of a safe forum in which their\nviews could be shared.\nRelevance to clinical practice. As PEG tube use becomes more common in long-term\ncare environments, care staff need to reflect upon the clinical and ethical issues that are raised.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, John","Lewin, David"],"dc:date":"2010-11-11T11:07:02Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1752-9824.2009.01036.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1146010,"sim:weight":0.336698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":564017,"sim:weight":0.307291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.24363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104462,"sim:weight":0.240767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.238342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666843,"sim:weight":0.229562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.226233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102645,"sim:weight":0.226208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99186,"sim:weight":0.2216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1649312,"sim:weight":0.220332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.219739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81039,"sim:weight":0.217355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664246,"sim:weight":0.213153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43408,"sim:weight":0.212726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55530,"sim:weight":0.208226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.207675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.206179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43546,"sim:weight":0.198789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.194793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.193446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The development of alternate musical instruments from the 1960s up to the present day breaks the traditional musical paradigm of effort in performance. This development also shadows concepts of space exploration technology such as teleoperation. Musical instruments can be evaluated in terms of a new musical effort paradigm; a young generation seems content to accept that there may be no apparent correlation between input effort and sound output.

{"identifier":114049,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Nancy Cunard\u0027s English journey","bibo:abstract":"This essay analyses Nancy Cunard\u0027s contribution to the struggle for racial justice in England and her work with the black communities in Liverpool and London (whose histories and experiences differ radically from their counterparts in the United States) in the 1940s. It chronicles for the first time her campaign to safeguard the African collections in the Liverpool Museum and her specific contribution to the archive of black British history. This includes not only the monumental the Negro Anthology (1934) but also the tract, The White Man\u0027s Duty (1943) arguing for an end to British imperialism and for race relations legislation. Cunard is situated within a history of the Communist left in Britain and the United States. Her insistence on the primacy of race differentiates her from other white left activists in her day for whom issues of gender and race were or secondary importance compared to those of class (Cunard, 1944). Using unpublished archive material from the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas I show that Cunard\u0027s work constitutes one segment in the rich and varied mosaic of black cultural activity in the 1930s and 1940s and discuss how Cunard knew and worked alongside some of the key figures in the black British politics of her day including Una Marson, Learie Constantine, John Carter, Harold Moody, Rudolph Dunbar and Paul Robeson. A prolific writer, publisher and political activist, Cunard presented a white readership with documentation which prompted them to question their own prejudice and rendered problematic the imaging of black people as fixed embodiments of a Eurocentric sense of reality. Cunard\u0027s work in the 1930s and 1940s predates the sailing of the Empire Windrush and the accelerated immigration to Britain from the Commonwealth after the Nationality Act of 1948. It adds to our knowledge of earlier black history, narratives, settlements, and anti-racist struggles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Joannou, Maroula"],"dc:date":"2010-11-03T14:06:08Z","doi":"10.1057/palgrave.fr.9400185","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69559,"sim:weight":0.479071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29199,"sim:weight":0.258028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710015,"sim:weight":0.252621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99025,"sim:weight":0.251892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75773,"sim:weight":0.235942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381933,"sim:weight":0.228586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381999,"sim:weight":0.222829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385299,"sim:weight":0.221243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44794,"sim:weight":0.220738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99441,"sim:weight":0.216879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45831,"sim:weight":0.213758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48270,"sim:weight":0.212773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145899,"sim:weight":0.208366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45904,"sim:weight":0.205638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381940,"sim:weight":0.201328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312663,"sim:weight":0.201205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44868,"sim:weight":0.199281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.195335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383584,"sim:weight":0.192487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710496,"sim:weight":0.184854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The research is part of a larger evaluation of a local enhanced primary care mental service. The initial survey and in-depth interviews with GPs reported here focused on the pre-existing counselling service. The results suggest that the benefits of on-site counsellors included reductions in prescribing, cost efficiencies and increased confidence amongst some GPs about providing psychological care themselves. These reported benefits appeared more likely to result when counselling service levels were perceived to be adequate and GPs were satisfied with their partnerships with the counsellors. The key mechanisms to explain the reported benefits were the provision of a safety net for GPs to extend their own practice, particularly when combined with close working relationships with the counsellor. The study has implications for the development of primary care mental health in the UK, particularly in relation to how the interface and working relationships between counsellors and GPs are designed and developed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schafer, Tim","Amoateng, Geoffrey","Wrycraft, Nick"],"dc:date":"2010-11-09T12:00:36Z","doi":"10.1080/03069880802534062","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Lawson and H Guite.

{"identifier":114068,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Protecting children through supporting parents","bibo:abstract":"All parents need social and emotional suppor t to ensure optimal outcomes for children. For the\nmajority of families, this suppor t comes through family and social networks and the institutions\nof education and health. The challenge for society is to protect and assist parents and children\nwhen things are going wrong. Although there are known indicators for risk, it can be hard to be\nsure of when and how to intervene in family life to protect children and suppor t parents. Such\ninterventions may have to be made in relation to episodic events, for example a recurrence of a\ndepression in one of the parents, and in the face of continuing difficulties, for example pover ty or\nsocial exclusion.\nThis paper examines two, quite different, challenges for professionals trying to suppor t parents.\nFirst, it makes some suggestions about how it is that professionals can fail to recognise signs of\nchild maltreatment. The identification of child maltreatment is critical in taking appropriate steps to\nprotect children. Second, it considers the complexity of the task of suppor ting parents, including\nwhether suppor t should be based on the parents views about services that they would like, or on\nprofessional and policy-makers judgements about how to meet the parents’ needs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Akister, Jane"],"dc:date":"2010-11-11T14:43:50Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43996,"sim:weight":0.38495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383650,"sim:weight":0.365395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145903,"sim:weight":0.36342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17849,"sim:weight":0.361385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.347716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48326,"sim:weight":0.34346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.338605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.323437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666623,"sim:weight":0.299367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46759,"sim:weight":0.299333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77112,"sim:weight":0.292312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59462,"sim:weight":0.285705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341025,"sim:weight":0.277123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101445,"sim:weight":0.261652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710576,"sim:weight":0.257221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46504,"sim:weight":0.251716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383611,"sim:weight":0.248572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382095,"sim:weight":0.244674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47016,"sim:weight":0.239237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76340,"sim:weight":0.237818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, there are\nreported limitations to both medication and CBT in the treatment of anxiety, and it appears prudent\nto consider additional methods of treatment that may offer effective interventions. One such\nintervention is based around the evidence of altered sensitivity within a number of physiological body\nsystems in anxiety patients (particularly those with PD), all of which are influenced in their function\nby habitual lifestyle behaviours. A randomised controlled trial compared a 16-week occupational\ntherapy-led lifestyle intervention and routine general practice (GP) care for PD. At 20 weeks, 14\nsymptoms with ‘moderate’ to ‘very severe’ ratings were assessed in 36 GP and 31 lifestyle-intervention\npatients. Composite symptom profiles, similar at baseline, were produced.The GP intervention\nproduced modest improvements in most symptoms. The lifestyle intervention overall produced\ngreater symptomatic relief (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, P\u003d 0.008).The physiological and cognitive\nsymptom profile also changed more with lifestyle intervention. Occupational therapists have\ndeveloped their interventions based on their understanding of everyday occupation. Habitual lifestyle\nbehaviours are characterised as being recurrent elements of everyday occupation and are, therefore,\nlegitimate targets for occupational therapy interventions. They provide a vehicle through which to\nencourage patients to regain understanding and control of their own anxiety symptoms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lambert, Rodney","Caan, Woody","McVicar, Andrew J."],"dc:date":"2010-11-11T13:55:50Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":80956,"sim:weight":0.25272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.245027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145722,"sim:weight":0.243541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26078,"sim:weight":0.24237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.242197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53737,"sim:weight":0.241311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998632,"sim:weight":0.238763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17360,"sim:weight":0.23796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1491398,"sim:weight":0.236127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":215949,"sim:weight":0.225399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":218119,"sim:weight":0.225399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220694,"sim:weight":0.225399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220695,"sim:weight":0.225399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220696,"sim:weight":0.225399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220697,"sim:weight":0.225399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708124,"sim:weight":0.217049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46759,"sim:weight":0.198997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46454,"sim:weight":0.198257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81553,"sim:weight":0.197768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146050,"sim:weight":0.190485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Ward doors were unlocked, patients were encouraged to undertake work-based activities and finally the wards were reorganised on ‘therapeutic community’ principles.\n\nDesign: This study used oral history methods to supplement evidence from published sources. A total of 27 oral history interviews were conducted between 2003–2008 and these data were analysed in the context of documentary material from local archives.\n\nResults: The establishment of wards at Fulbourn run on therapeutic community lines posed considerable challenges to the customary working practices of their mental health nurses. The two themes highlighted in this paper were the symbolic meaning of the abandonment of nursing uniforms in favour of casual clothing and the hospital authorities’ preparedness to accept the risks associated with implementing the philosophy of the therapeutic community.\n\nConclusions: Oral history has a unique role to play in recording the detailed aspects of nursing practice which are often difficult\nto reconstruct from documentary sources alone.\n\nRelevance to clinical practice: Nurses played a key role in the transformation of the therapeutic milieu of Fulbourn Hospital and\ntheir experiences have relevance to current debates in mental health care.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, John"],"dc:date":"2010-11-18T12:09:22Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.02904.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":3662,"sim:weight":0.457921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387374,"sim:weight":0.433615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91320,"sim:weight":0.400274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91540,"sim:weight":0.400274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.355439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382059,"sim:weight":0.350223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382087,"sim:weight":0.341176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43546,"sim:weight":0.339085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382009,"sim:weight":0.332171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102645,"sim:weight":0.323353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48318,"sim:weight":0.31062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.298657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382760,"sim:weight":0.296423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.29057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.285569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651882,"sim:weight":0.283668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102665,"sim:weight":0.280802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383385,"sim:weight":0.278834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.278696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.274581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first point of contact for most people with common mental health problems, such as mild to moderate anxiety or depression, is their general practitioner. The location of specialist employment advisers in GP surgeries is therefore a logical attempt to address the issue of people falling out of the workplace, through the provision of early intervention and combined vocational and psychological treatment packages. In 2007 the Richmond Fellowship, a national mental health charity, received a grant to provide four employment advisors to work with GP surgeries in Eastern England. The aim was to help people with mental health problems gain work (Regain clients) or retain their current employment (Retain clients). \n\nIn this study a realistic evaluation framework was applied to address the question of what works, for whom and in which contexts through interviews with key stakeholders including 22 clients of the project, five primary health care staff and the four employment advisers.\n\nThe interventions that Retain clients found most helpful were careers guidance (including psychological profiling) and developing strategies to negotiate and communicate with employers. These appeared to help individuals to take control, broaden their horizons and move forward. In many cases this was supported by assistance in helping clients think through whether they wanted to consider a career change. For Regain clients the most important interventions were help with interview skills, CV writing and assertiveness training. \n\nEmployment outcomes were considerably higher for the Retain clients than for the Regain clients. The study indicates that it could be more effective for Retain and Regain services to be delivered through different care pathways to avoid diluting the services offered and consequently reducing their effectiveness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pittam, Gail","Boyce, Melanie J.","Secker, Jenny","Lockett, Helen","Samele, Chiara"],"dc:date":"2010-11-23T15:06:22Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2524.2010.00929.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83506,"sim:weight":0.444116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22782,"sim:weight":0.34669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654518,"sim:weight":0.314851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17360,"sim:weight":0.304804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":363904,"sim:weight":0.299866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":215949,"sim:weight":0.297879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":218119,"sim:weight":0.297879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220694,"sim:weight":0.297879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220695,"sim:weight":0.297879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220696,"sim:weight":0.297879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220697,"sim:weight":0.297879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.292522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.288181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55959,"sim:weight":0.280835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44978,"sim:weight":0.267502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998639,"sim:weight":0.260991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83001,"sim:weight":0.257441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1922491,"sim:weight":0.253733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66883,"sim:weight":0.250674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.24516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of the study is to provide qualitative and descriptive\nquantitative information about the life-cycles of self-help groups, the\nproblems that they face throughout their existence and the likelihood of\ndifferent problems leading to their closure. The database was not\ncollated for research purposes and so we restrict our discussion of the\nfindings to identification of broad patterns regarding the birth and\nclosure rates of different types of group and questions for future\nresearch. Comparisons were made between groups that addressed different\ntypes of problem, groups with different memberships and groups\nthat had reached different stages in their existence. There was reasonable\nconsistency in the survival rates of different types of group with physical\nhealth groups being the most likely to reach maturity followed by\nmental health and lastly social issue groups. Survival rates for groups\nthat serve different membership populations were reasonably constant\nalthough there were some anomalies. There were high levels of consistency\nregarding the reasons for closure for groups closing at different\nstages of maturity. The most commonly cited reasons among all groups\nwere the withdrawal of a ‘key’ member and a decline in membership.\nThe article suggests that some of the assumptions and prescriptions\nwithin the existing literature need to be considered in light of more\ndetailed empirical evidence, and it raises questions about the theoretical\nunderstanding of self-help groups.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chaudhary, Sarah","Avis, Mark","Munn-Giddings, Carol"],"dc:date":"2010-11-18T14:28:24Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2524.2009.00899.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1146027,"sim:weight":0.281309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.2429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.242299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43346,"sim:weight":0.240014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90435,"sim:weight":0.234903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.233625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.228831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.223548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109246,"sim:weight":0.215071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44441,"sim:weight":0.213734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.212238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.212165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.209614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.208539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3179,"sim:weight":0.205927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.205492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.205492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.205492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.205492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.205492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A decrease in cervical cancer cases in the country\nwas reported between 1988 and 1997.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kraszewski, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2010-11-23T14:34:02Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":835423,"sim:weight":0.589038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":835137,"sim:weight":0.525408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":922273,"sim:weight":0.490203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98701,"sim:weight":0.477872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393442,"sim:weight":0.462258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26274,"sim:weight":0.461515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":546048,"sim:weight":0.379608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":868222,"sim:weight":0.360072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387196,"sim:weight":0.350617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":951308,"sim:weight":0.347835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":835169,"sim:weight":0.320905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1004163,"sim:weight":0.311883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99220,"sim:weight":0.302068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49359,"sim:weight":0.302013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49237,"sim:weight":0.290377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033618,"sim:weight":0.281436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387892,"sim:weight":0.265908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57890,"sim:weight":0.238143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77494,"sim:weight":0.237435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1004154,"sim:weight":0.230803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It examines what George Lansbury and the official Labour Party-TUC delegation found during their trips to Russia, and also the findings of Ramsay MacDonald who travelled to Georgia. These visits were important to British socialists, as they were crucial sources of information about the construction of socialism. But, as the article shows, no definitive viewpoint of the Soviet system emerged in the visitors\u0027 reports, books and articles. This allowed the travellers to use the Soviet system to prove that their own individual interpretations of socialism were correct, thus justifying their own political position at a time when interest in Soviet Russia was growing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davis, Jonathan"],"dc:date":"2010-11-24T11:18:30Z","doi":"10.1080/09546540500091159","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9849,"sim:weight":0.39065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60866,"sim:weight":0.383512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77455,"sim:weight":0.338128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.320597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382064,"sim:weight":0.309844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109116,"sim:weight":0.303409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101251,"sim:weight":0.301133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75498,"sim:weight":0.298836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44396,"sim:weight":0.298092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382035,"sim:weight":0.296711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58478,"sim:weight":0.293411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.292928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43510,"sim:weight":0.287754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108765,"sim:weight":0.287541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58411,"sim:weight":0.286796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60707,"sim:weight":0.283726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382032,"sim:weight":0.282194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108694,"sim:weight":0.281324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654695,"sim:weight":0.276637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77016,"sim:weight":0.275661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

How discourses of modernization have both silenced and limited debate on domiciliary care for older people","bibo:abstract":"Policy statements about the care of vulnerable older people repeatedly emphasize the desirability of keeping people at home. An enduring problem in implementing this strategy is the ongoing crisis within the quasi-market in domiciliary care. The government announced in 2004 that it wanted a new vision for adult social care. In such circumstances, it could be argued that, in order to achieve home care services that are stable, flexible and better placed to integrate more effectively with health agencies, local authorities should significantly expand in-house provision. Despite exhortations from ministers to think the unthinkable, such a proposal is actually ‘unsayable’. This article discusses how discourses of modernization exclude ideas that imply an expansion of directly provided social care. Such discourses have so much invested in the shedding of what it regards as outmoded ‘welfarist’ baggage, they are blind to proposals that could improve the lives of older, vulnerable citizens.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scourfield, Peter"],"dc:date":"2010-11-24T16:33:36Z","doi":"10.1177/0261018306059764","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":106316,"sim:weight":0.405379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931313,"sim:weight":0.379791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731320,"sim:weight":0.334879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1342224,"sim:weight":0.285516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81239,"sim:weight":0.266379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43408,"sim:weight":0.265816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43727,"sim:weight":0.265594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.265039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.248757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496274,"sim:weight":0.243472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.239363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.229044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664693,"sim:weight":0.22108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.220128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3533,"sim:weight":0.218993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106621,"sim:weight":0.21084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18124,"sim:weight":0.209426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.208047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43523,"sim:weight":0.200249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99216,"sim:weight":0.190919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is in the nature of a marketized and privatized care system that homes will periodically close or change ownership. The physical and mental well-being of elderly residents experiencing eviction and relocation can be seriously damaged by the experience. No policy and practice guidelines have been issued from central government to cover how care home closures should be managed. Local authorities are therefore dealing with such events on an ad hoc basis. Understandably, the main emphasis is often put on actually finding appropriate alternative placements. Practices vary across different local authorities. This article asks whether the necessary work required to minimize the harmful effects caused by the stress of relocation is actually being carried out properly. It also raises the questions of what exactly should be offered to older people when they are given notice to quit, who is best qualified to do the work and whether care management as it has developed within the ‘purchaser/provider framework’, is adequate to the task. In short, where can social work for older people be found when it is needed?","bibo:AuthorList":["Scourfield, Peter"],"dc:date":"2010-11-24T15:52:45Z","doi":"10.1093/bjsw","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1666846,"sim:weight":0.375826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81039,"sim:weight":0.375518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931313,"sim:weight":0.363526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731320,"sim:weight":0.351514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":328241,"sim:weight":0.344685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":199795,"sim:weight":0.330192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48400,"sim:weight":0.322945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43408,"sim:weight":0.322554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91599,"sim:weight":0.312328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43727,"sim:weight":0.287008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341025,"sim:weight":0.28417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.273134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.259811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99461,"sim:weight":0.25939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383611,"sim:weight":0.255223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.25494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44572,"sim:weight":0.250787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496274,"sim:weight":0.249774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.24707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381989,"sim:weight":0.243662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Few areas of state activity have been more visibly subjected to New Labour’s modernization agenda than the personal social services. Local authority social services departments have largely ceased to exist as separate organizational entities. However, modernization has also required that the relationship between state and citizen be reconstructed. This is evident in New Labour’s vision for adult social care which envisages a move towards individual budgets. The individualizing nature of such schemes may be thought hard to reconcile with the discourse of integration and partnership prominent elsewhere. However, a key linking concept is that of ‘person-centredness’. It is often assumed that this simply means that public services become more flexible to meet the needs of ‘the person’. This paper uses the example of direct payments to demonstrate how modernization also requires flexibility of ‘the person’. It would appear that inherent in New Labour’s project of modernization is the assumption that the modern citizen should be both managerial and entrepreneurial. What were once public responsibilities are being transferred to the individual. The implications for the users of adult social care are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scourfield, Peter"],"dc:date":"2010-11-24T16:46:25Z","doi":"10.1093/bjsw","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Scourfield.

Included in these measures are policies which set out to involve local communities in decision- making regarding how the policing of anti-social behaviour is to be carried out.\n\nThis case study focuses on the way in which one community, or at least a vocal minority of that community, has influenced the way in which anti-social behaviour policies have been implemented.\n\nThose representing the community had only one interest, which was to ensure that the people with a street lifestyle disappeared from the streets. What happened to them afterwards was of little interest. This contrasted with the police and local council who were interested in a longer-term, reasoned solution to the problem.\n\nIn this particular study, the more considered approach of the police and local authority was overwhelmed by the demands by the community for the people with a street lifestyle to be expelled from the area. This duly happened through the imposition of a range of disciplinary measures.\n\nWe suggest however that this exclusionary approach to deviant groups has a long tradition. Using Rutherford\u0027s concepts of visibility and elimination, we explore the history of community responses to deviant groups and locate the specific case study within a long tradition of communities\u0027 desires to expel deviants. We suggest finally that the more New Labour involves local communities in combating anti-social behaviour, the more prominent these themes are likely to become.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, Stephen","Scourfield, Peter"],"dc:date":"2010-11-29T12:47:13Z","doi":"10.1057/palgrave.cpcs.8140224","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100220,"sim:weight":0.394113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60862,"sim:weight":0.379074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100349,"sim:weight":0.365352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43845,"sim:weight":0.351322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.34002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.330002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54985,"sim:weight":0.326936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.326498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929826,"sim:weight":0.326089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102735,"sim:weight":0.317045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101435,"sim:weight":0.306457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96024,"sim:weight":0.301907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383630,"sim:weight":0.295728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665592,"sim:weight":0.29359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.284684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43687,"sim:weight":0.280826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383560,"sim:weight":0.275576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54165,"sim:weight":0.256096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95764,"sim:weight":0.249915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103043,"sim:weight":0.244769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the main, its response has been to introduce a range of punitive measures. The main subjects of these punitive policies appear to be young people, whose activities are perceived to be closely linked to anti-social behaviour and fear of crime. Critics have argued that these measures merely increase the fear of crime amongst older generations by weakening informal controls and limiting contact between the generations. In this article, we review intergenerational practice (IP) which has been growing in popularity in both the USA and the UK, and which stresses the importance of creating dialogue between generations, which it is claimed can help prevent anti-social behaviour and limit fear. We examine critically the theory and practice of IP and suggest that although it has substantial flaws, it may provide a useful way forward to limiting anti-social behaviour and fear of crime, when linked with wider social regeneration programmes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, Stephen","Statham, Elaine"],"dc:date":"2010-11-30T11:57:07Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1468-2311.2006.00438.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101601,"sim:weight":0.522974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929826,"sim:weight":0.437165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383630,"sim:weight":0.427794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51960,"sim:weight":0.404884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100220,"sim:weight":0.35242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1347928,"sim:weight":0.297924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54165,"sim:weight":0.29608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.293712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1431344,"sim:weight":0.2752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.266143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57174,"sim:weight":0.25177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.233551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.203831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43845,"sim:weight":0.188983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2887,"sim:weight":0.188605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":261048,"sim:weight":0.187901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710069,"sim:weight":0.178268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.174231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.173118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106621,"sim:weight":0.171478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A specific event in the mid-1970s ensured that musicians within Northern Ireland could not evade the vexed relationship of pop and politics. After a late night concert in Banbridge, Co. Down in July 1975, a popular Irish outfit called The Miami Showband were viciously attacked by the Ulster Volunteer Force, a Loyalist paramilitary group. In the course of the attack, three members of the band were shot dead, while another was critically injured. As Britain\u0027s Melody Maker music paper explained the following week, the attack was \u0027the first time that musicians [had] been chosen as a target for violence\u0027 in Northern Ireland, and local musicians were consequently in \u0027fear that the province\u0027s musical life [might] collapse\u0027.\n\nThe event had two long-term effects on popular music-making in Northern Ireland. First, \u0027the myth of a sectarian-free popular music was shattered\u0027; from now on it would be clear that musicians were \u0027as likely as anyone else to be identified in the restrictive religious and / or political terms that defined the Troubles\u0027. Second, the attack would stigmatize Ireland - and particularly Northern Ireland - as \u0027a problem destination for international rock acts\u0027. However, an unexpected consequence of the de facto touring boycott of Northern Ireland was an upsurge of domestic music-making. The late 1970s witnessed a marked increase in popular music-making activities across Northern Ireland, a development that overlapped – quite significantly - with the emergent \u0027do-it-yourself\u0027 ethos of punk, which convinced many youngsters in Northern Ireland (as elsewhere) to write songs that addressed their own everyday lives. This article explores the particular ways in which this political crisis was engaged - and also eschewed - by punk and post-punk bands in Northern Ireland, before addressing important aspects of the post-ceasefire music scene.","bibo:AuthorList":["Campbell, Sean"],"dc:date":"2010-11-30T14:42:21Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69811,"sim:weight":0.426874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104668,"sim:weight":0.387918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929886,"sim:weight":0.378703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101628,"sim:weight":0.361026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.343012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43868,"sim:weight":0.342582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634694,"sim:weight":0.326885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105043,"sim:weight":0.314531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43379,"sim:weight":0.311665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352182,"sim:weight":0.310925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43183,"sim:weight":0.303389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57682,"sim:weight":0.274834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381994,"sim:weight":0.266429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89116,"sim:weight":0.258586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44390,"sim:weight":0.255793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929832,"sim:weight":0.252156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46639,"sim:weight":0.250405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43419,"sim:weight":0.228059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98742,"sim:weight":0.223984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45277,"sim:weight":0.222452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Such emancipation seems possible because of the protagonists’ emotional orientation but also due to their overall superior cognitive behaviour. The study is very original in its combination of cultural and gender perspectives for the comparative analysis of the two popular films, and – although other research has in the meantime followed in the elaboration of gender aspects – the combination of the two perspectives remains unique. Findings include the discussion of key ideas from widely-known studies on capitalism (Weber, Ritzer) and post-feminism (Kaplan, Humm) as potential sub-texts of the films. In particular, the study provides evidence for a cinematic deconstruction of capitalist values as pseudo-rational, destructive and inhuman, a rupture with gendered binaries (the notion of rational/superior males versus irrational/inferior females breaks within the protagonists’ hybridity) and offers alternative readings for marginalised roles, including the representation of handicapped people.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rings, Guido"],"dc:date":"2010-12-08T10:29:16Z","doi":"10.1515/fabl.2005.46.3-4.197","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.185375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48286,"sim:weight":0.17582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.161033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.152826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.149704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352166,"sim:weight":0.145934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340689,"sim:weight":0.144063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48296,"sim:weight":0.143163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383352,"sim:weight":0.142571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43485,"sim:weight":0.142532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.141789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.140616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383587,"sim:weight":0.140568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99028,"sim:weight":0.13739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381919,"sim:weight":0.135801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.134591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.133921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.133586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931412,"sim:weight":0.133344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The debate among critics about whether it is the documentary or the drama that has the most to offer is staged as a contest between reality and fiction. A close examination of this debate, however, reveals the extent to which the categories of reality and fiction are in fact interwoven, with interpretation of both films reliant not only on how they relate to actuality but how they relate to each other. This essay considers how the two films trade in images of Wuornos as monstrous other, and how that trade is revealing about the perceived status and relationship between documentary and dramatizations of real life and the kind of work these forms of fact-based representation are seen to perform in public culture. Of particular interest is the tension between reality and performance, as revealed through the media focus on the actress Charlize Theron\u0027s transformation into Wuornos in Monster.","bibo:AuthorList":["Horeck, Tanya"],"dc:date":"2010-12-07T12:32:46Z","doi":"10.1093/screen","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664529,"sim:weight":0.279904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.272131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1060392,"sim:weight":0.263565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382086,"sim:weight":0.263346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5226933,"sim:weight":0.258271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780776,"sim:weight":0.252492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051961,"sim:weight":0.25058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99117,"sim:weight":0.244604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.244271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761070,"sim:weight":0.241243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18048,"sim:weight":0.239511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.239443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182178,"sim:weight":0.239322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.236334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710586,"sim:weight":0.232192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710188,"sim:weight":0.231967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.231341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.230015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45332,"sim:weight":0.227806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931412,"sim:weight":0.22628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper argues that recent developments must be interpreted in the context of two earlier periods during which science was integral to, first racism and then anti-racism. The growing ascendancy of biologism has prompted both utopian and dystopian accounts of the future: one in which scientific racism is revived, the other in which science finally abolishes race thinking. These futures resonate socially and politically, but lack plausibility when held up against either the historical experience of racism or detailed examination of the apparent direction of biologism. The paper argues, however, that there are significant changes taking place. The new biology challenges existing notions of relatedness, personhood and the nature/culture distinction, and is altering the terrain over which race is discussed. The paper highlights some the features of this new setting by exploring the emergence of novel expressions of racialized politics that both utilize biology in the construction of identity and see biology itself as a site of struggle.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skinner, David"],"dc:date":"2010-12-07T11:54:15Z","doi":"10.1177/0306312706054859","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2731292,"sim:weight":0.346638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44868,"sim:weight":0.346127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75773,"sim:weight":0.268289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.25637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.234153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340689,"sim:weight":0.231905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.226725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76873,"sim:weight":0.223914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99497,"sim:weight":0.219848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.211192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.20768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.200562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17989,"sim:weight":0.199437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999497,"sim:weight":0.199383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98865,"sim:weight":0.197948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.195417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710015,"sim:weight":0.192159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.191113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101381,"sim:weight":0.187999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.187765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It may be, however, that a more nuanced contextual reading of these final Idylls will yield a different story and a different resolution, one in which Balin and Balan emerges as the ultimate psychological resolution of the cycle as a whole.","bibo:AuthorList":["Purton, Valerie"],"dc:date":"2010-12-09T15:53:23Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8769060,"sim:weight":0.272731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43835,"sim:weight":0.254338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108435,"sim:weight":0.24643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.243249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43177,"sim:weight":0.24228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77120,"sim:weight":0.241821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44084,"sim:weight":0.241305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108542,"sim:weight":0.240625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9552790,"sim:weight":0.240593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381966,"sim:weight":0.240258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108601,"sim:weight":0.239769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.239563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382085,"sim:weight":0.23648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108667,"sim:weight":0.234571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.234385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109172,"sim:weight":0.233525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383589,"sim:weight":0.231824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387198,"sim:weight":0.226148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44568,"sim:weight":0.223531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43375,"sim:weight":0.22144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It was first staged by the King\u0027s Men at the Globe Theatre sometime in late 1607 or 1608, and contemporary dramatists referred to it as a model of popularity. Robert Taylor\u0027s Prologue to his c.1613-14 The Hog Hath Lost His Pearl hopes that: \u0027And if [the play] prove so happy as to please, / We\u0027ll say \u0027tis fortunate, like Pericles\u0027. Ben Jonson\u0027s 1631 poem \u0027On The New Inn\u0027 complains of the lasting audience interest in Shakespeare\u0027s \u0027mouldy tale\u0027, some twenty years after it was first staged. A licence to revive the play was granted in that same year, suggesting that Jonson\u0027s envy had some basis in fact. In 1640, James Shirley alludes to Pericles in his Arcadia, in which one of his characters exclaims: \u0027Tire me? I am no woman. Keep your tires to yourself. Nor am I Pericles Prince of Tyre.\u0027 The pun suggests that Shakespeare\u0027s play was still current towards the close of the theatres in 1642. In the Interregnum, Samuel Sheppard\u0027s poem The Times Displayed in Six Sestiads (1646) singles out Pericles in praise of Shakespeare: “See him whose tragic scenes Euripides / Doth equal, and with Sophocles we may / Compare great Shakespeare. Aristophanes / Never like him, his fancy could display. / Witness his Prince of Tyre, his Pericles.” / Pericles also appears to have been the first Shakespeare play to be staged during the Restoration, when theatres reopened in 1659, and it was revived again in 1661.","bibo:AuthorList":["Giddens, Eugene"],"dc:date":"2010-12-07T14:25:05Z","doi":"10.1017/CCOL9780521881784.010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631972,"sim:weight":0.535461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387696,"sim:weight":0.356795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98728,"sim:weight":0.34824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631922,"sim:weight":0.340434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709951,"sim:weight":0.336603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75569,"sim:weight":0.329651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384107,"sim:weight":0.329304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631617,"sim:weight":0.308673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631965,"sim:weight":0.307689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631941,"sim:weight":0.296875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631953,"sim:weight":0.290109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382037,"sim:weight":0.288665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631940,"sim:weight":0.259754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48335,"sim:weight":0.254385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631644,"sim:weight":0.245324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632008,"sim:weight":0.245222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631952,"sim:weight":0.241228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632004,"sim:weight":0.241181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631971,"sim:weight":0.235173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631976,"sim:weight":0.233699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The primary contribution of the special edition was to set an agenda for future research and analysis of ‘race’, science and technology. The papers are major case studies of topics including agricultural technology and migrant labour, the policing of car use, the roots of information technology, child development and media coverage of the Human Genome Diversity Project. The introductory essay refocused and advanced discussions in science and technology studies in three directions. Firstly, it used ‘race’ to engage with a wider debate as to whether the emphasis within science technology studies on relativism and extreme forms of constructivism led to an abdication of political and ethical responsibility. Secondly, it showed the worth of bringing science and technology studies together with other sub-disciplines (notably cultural studies and the sociology of ‘race’ and racism). Last but by no means least, it set out a new programme for science and technology studies that considered the co-construction of science and technology on the one hand and of racial and ethnic categories on the other. Many of the issues raised in the introduction – notably the consequences of the new biology for understandings of human difference - have since become significant areas for debate within social studies of science and technology. The special edition of Science as Culture was a joint effort between Paul Rosen and David Sknner with Paul Rosen taking the lead on the editing of articles and David Sknner taking the lead on the development of the introductory essay.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skinner, David","Rosen, Paul"],"dc:date":"2010-12-08T10:34:53Z","doi":"10.1080/09505430120074109","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44868,"sim:weight":0.294926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.294265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1657,"sim:weight":0.291198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.288067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2884,"sim:weight":0.27679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29199,"sim:weight":0.274783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1152086,"sim:weight":0.270065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731292,"sim:weight":0.256447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385299,"sim:weight":0.254406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.247987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.24526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.245256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.245256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75773,"sim:weight":0.232725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381999,"sim:weight":0.227054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387418,"sim:weight":0.212131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.211211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.209575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312663,"sim:weight":0.208362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44978,"sim:weight":0.207371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Rural artists\u0027 colonies have been unjustly neglected by an art history preoccupied with the urban avant-garde. Yet these communities hatched some of the most exciting innovations of late 19th-century painting. Moreover, the practices and images of rural artists articulated central concerns of urban middle-class audiences, in particular the yearning for a life that was authentic, pre-modern and immersed in nature. Paradoxically, it was precisely this nostalgia that placed artists\u0027 colonies firmly within modernity, mainly through their contribution to an emergent mass tourism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lübbren, Nina"],"dc:date":"2011-11-21T10:45:03Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47274,"sim:weight":0.452372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.282484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.225209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.218055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.19589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43037,"sim:weight":0.193798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352197,"sim:weight":0.191192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88606,"sim:weight":0.188302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9430949,"sim:weight":0.185052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":771294,"sim:weight":0.175141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1636448,"sim:weight":0.167002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.166855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382030,"sim:weight":0.16011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.154658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383665,"sim:weight":0.154658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48276,"sim:weight":0.148712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382369,"sim:weight":0.140183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2888,"sim:weight":0.139776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.138964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99028,"sim:weight":0.136341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The numerical results were not conclusive owing to high variability and small sample size, but the qualitative data reveal interesting facets of the process (e.g., that the therapists\u0027 and patients\u0027 perceptions of the treatment coincided in all treatment cases).","bibo:AuthorList":["Odell-Miller, Helen","Hughes, P.","Westacott, M."],"dc:date":"2010-12-13T12:22:50Z","doi":"10.1080/10503300500268342","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1632320,"sim:weight":0.306665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":363904,"sim:weight":0.286754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98489,"sim:weight":0.253498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102665,"sim:weight":0.237445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76464,"sim:weight":0.236475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145722,"sim:weight":0.234061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.233528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43193,"sim:weight":0.2291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654376,"sim:weight":0.219006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43430,"sim:weight":0.214878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.210695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.202104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2819,"sim:weight":0.198258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98854,"sim:weight":0.196717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46453,"sim:weight":0.195814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.194767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708124,"sim:weight":0.193966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664714,"sim:weight":0.192953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101389,"sim:weight":0.191732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.191492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This centers upon the notion that “friendships were not ‘set apart’ or private but were instead public, religious relationships developed in order to navigate the dangerous world of public transactions” (Furey 5). The exchange of letters enabled individuals to “demarcate a realm of spiritual meaning—a new kind of religious community bound together by affective relationships and a shared interest in spiritualized scholarship” (Furey 5). These relationships formed a community that embraced the lives and works of the individuals involved which functioned “as a hermeneutic, a locus of spiritual practices, a manifestation of spiritual values, and a pathway for intimacy with each other and with Christ” (Furey 9). The incorporation of religion within the traditional rubric of the republic of letters deconstructs its usual binary opposition to secularization and allows the exploration of “ideas and relationships that are imbued with a transcendent dimension” fostered through the creation of “affective, activist friendships” (Furey 170, 13). It may seem odd to move from Catholic humanists to American Puritans, but the concept of a religious republic of letters can be usefully deployed in understanding the correspondence of two American ministers, John Eliot and John Woodbridge, with the prominent English Nonconformist Richard Baxter. These men were part of a similar spiritual “communion of saints.” This association was nurtured through an affective understanding of divine and human relationships, shared theological values and reading, a commitment to learning and scholarship, and the constant possibility of persecution by the authorities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alison Searle"],"dc:date":"2010-12-13T15:59:28Z","doi":"10.1353/eal.0.0002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26084,"sim:weight":0.248716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.222376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99509,"sim:weight":0.220009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43683,"sim:weight":0.215522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101605,"sim:weight":0.19942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99200,"sim:weight":0.198133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75552,"sim:weight":0.188937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383653,"sim:weight":0.179553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46863,"sim:weight":0.179378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43833,"sim:weight":0.17431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43653,"sim:weight":0.172671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98954,"sim:weight":0.169844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43825,"sim:weight":0.166243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44140,"sim:weight":0.162899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352178,"sim:weight":0.160994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.159353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145162,"sim:weight":0.153823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43731,"sim:weight":0.147935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76471,"sim:weight":0.147689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43493,"sim:weight":0.145643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":114121,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Blurring or shifting boundaries? Concepts of culture in Turkish–German migrant cinema","bibo:abstract":"This paper aims to explore the developments of different concepts of culture in Turkish–German Migrant Cinema before and after German Unification. Key questions addressed will be: \n1. How do these films express cultural differences and to what extent does this representation follow traditional concepts of culture?\n2. How is the interconnectedness of cultures articulated and how far does this relate to current notions of interculturalism and transculturalism? \n3. Which are the key differences of former migrants’ cinematic representations in pre- and post-unified Germany?\nUnlike common perceptions, this paper will argue that most films, including productions by celebrated directors such as Fatih Akın, continue to draw on traditional concepts of culture that break with the strong transcultural perspectives voiced by the same directors. While there is a development from rather separatist multicultural and intercultural representations in Turkish–German cinema before Unification towards more interconnected transcultural portrayals in post-Unification films, many contemporary productions maintain monocultural perspectives. All this seems to follow trends originating from German Cinema about migrants but there is also evidence that a traditional concept of ‘Kanaken’ culture developed in and disseminated via Migrant Literature and Cinema has made its way into German film.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rings, Guido"],"dc:date":"2011-03-15T10:25:14Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Constantine P Danopoulos and Daniel Zirker.

We hypothesized that there is an association between the presence of SDs and the PD affective state. Sixty nine PD patients were assessed for the presence of SDs by undergoing cognitive screening with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), completing three inventories: a swallowing disturbance questionnaire (SDQ), the Spielberger manual for the trait anxiety and Beck depression inventories. All patients underwent clinical swallowing evaluations by a speech and language pathologist (SLP). Patients diagnosed with SDs were also assessed by fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) performed by an ENT and SLP. Thirty eight patients experienced SDs, the other 31 did not. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were matched. Patients with SDs experienced increased anxiety and depression compared to patients without SDs. Comparisons between patients who scored in the two opposite ends of the anxiety and depression ranges demonstrated that the most anxious and depressed patients reported more swallowing difficulties (SDQ scores) compared with the least anxious and depressed ones. In addition, the most anxious patients had significantly increased disease severity and decreased MMSE scores compared with the least anxious patients. Disease severity was also increased in the most depressed patients compared with the least depressed ones. Advanced disease emerged as being associated with high anxiety levels and greater numbers of SDs. The contribution of anxiety or depression to the development or worsening of SDs and their role in treatment strategy warrant further investigation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Manor,Yael","Balas, Meirav","Giladi, Nir","Mootanah, Rajshree","Cohen, Jacob T."],"dc:date":"2011-12-06T12:37:28Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Stringer.

It has also downplayed the idea of genius, often subordinating the autonomy of the author to larger linguistic or political pressures and structures. In this essay I aim to demonstrate the continuing potency of the idea of the vates, or poet prophet, not in criticism, but in popular culture. By contrast with Plato, who thought the productions of poets and artists were merely weak copies of copied forms, Neil Gaiman\u0027s The Sandman, Terry Pratchett\u0027s Lords and Ladies, and Gareth Roberts\u0027s “The Shakespeare Code” all present the composition, performance and quotation of poetry as potentially magical, creative acts with the potential to summon new worlds into existence. Through their playful engagement with the boundaries which separate fiction from reality, this world from the next, each of these three popular responses to Shakespeare\u0027s magic achieves a delicate equipoise between belief and unbelief, scepticism and wonder, which may prove more subtle and satisfying than many scholarly responses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Sarah A."],"dc:date":"2011-02-11T10:15:17Z","doi":"10.1080/17450910902921591","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98728,"sim:weight":0.328475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387696,"sim:weight":0.304279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44515,"sim:weight":0.292041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43223,"sim:weight":0.270982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631617,"sim:weight":0.25289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631941,"sim:weight":0.2343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631953,"sim:weight":0.213056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631626,"sim:weight":0.197921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48335,"sim:weight":0.197435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.195828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352215,"sim:weight":0.171138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.168356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145766,"sim:weight":0.157277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.154389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48412,"sim:weight":0.152696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44650,"sim:weight":0.152175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43273,"sim:weight":0.151867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.145913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383589,"sim:weight":0.145498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.140467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":114127,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Thesis"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Shaping the identity of peripheral art museums in Israel during the nineties.","bibo:abstract":"The aim of this study is to explore the process that shaped the identity of peripheral art museums in Israel during decade the 1990s. This process is examined though the eyes of the curators who artistically guided and directed two of these museums, the Janco Dada Museum in Ein Hod and the Ein Harod Museum of Art at Kibbutz Ein Harod. Both museums are non-profit organizations and this study is the first to seek to understand the identity of these two small but significant art museums located in villages in the north of Israel. The research examines the meaning of the identity of the museums by drawing upon theories of museology, centre and periphery, personal and group identity and organization identity. This research is based on knowledge that is personal, unique and subjective. It is conducted using an inductive approach towards gathering, analysing and interpreting data. The research utilizes a case study approach in order to provide an explanation for the cultural organization of the museum and for the attitude of the curators. This is documentary research that is based on only one source, the museum\u0027s archives which are examined according to multi- method procedures for gathering data. The evidence showed that in both cases the process of constructing the identity of the art museums links the personal views as well as the professional aims of the curators and their activities. These activities link the identity of the art museum to the natural setting. In addition, these activities, in both cases, link the identity of the museum to the relationship of the centre and periphery. In addition, both curators wished to differentiate their museum from the centre. In the research process new links were created between diverse scientific disciplines such as museology and social science and theories derived from different fields such as art history, sociology, and centre and periphery studies. These links, contribute new insights into our understanding of museology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heller, Sorin"],"dc:date":"2011-02-22T12:38:55Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382913,"sim:weight":0.536649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312663,"sim:weight":0.441085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43953,"sim:weight":0.372232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.340741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.328862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664679,"sim:weight":0.305326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.269227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.236028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.235284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.233556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.217013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.211499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.211499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.211499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.211499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.211499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.211499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.211499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.211499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.211499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":114128,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Thesis"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Teaching modes of teacher-educators teaching distance-learning in a teacher-training college in Israel: A case study","bibo:abstract":"The introduction of technology and the widespread use of ICT in the wealthier nations have led teacher-educators to integrate technological applications in their teaching environment. The research investigated the new teaching modes created by teacher-educators in teacher-training\ncolleges in Israel, due to their transition from traditional teaching to distance-teaching through the Internet.\nThis was a qualitative research using case study within an interpretative paradigm that\nenabled the researcher to consider the viewpoints of the informants together with her own viewpoint. The research tools included: 14 open interviews, a non-participatory observation, documentation reading and the writing of a personal log. The rich variety of research tools enabled triangulation of data. The conceptual framework of the research was based on theories of teacher-training, distance-teaching, academic disciplines, and\nseveral teaching dimensions: organisation and representation of data, organisation and\nmanagement of teaching and different types of interaction.\nThe research findings indicated intrinsic and extrinsic motives for the teacher-educators transition to distance-teaching. The transition created a pedagogy characterised by four teaching modes that corresponded to different academic disciplines. Each discipline harnessed the technology for intensive use in one or more of the teaching dimensions.\nThe Representation mode used by teacher-educators in the natural sciences and statistics used a large variety of data representations and Internet writing characterised by multiple links. The Interactive mode employed by teacher-educators in the field of literacy\nprincipally dealt with formative assessment of the students\u0027 writing and used virtual\ncommunication tools to tighten the teacher-learner inter-personal interaction. The\nOrganisational mode used in education disciplines focused on organisation and\nmanagement of teaching and learning through the use of computer applications. The\nHolistic mode employed by teacher-educators in the fields of education and literature, in\nsubstance constituted a combination of all the characteristics of the above-mentioned\nmodes with an emphasis given to social presence of both learners and the teacher.\nAnalysis of the teaching modes led to the creation of a typology of four modes positioned at different points along the following scales: organisation of teaching, flexible – fixed, types of interaction few – multiple; data representation, creative – conservative; computer literate – computer users. There was a clear contrast between teacher-educators teaching education disciplines as a continuation of traditional frontal teaching and those who had previously taught in workshops.\nAt the crossroads of pedagogy with technology, the changes in location, time and lesson character have meant that the implementation of the teaching paradigm of Zeichner and the teaching orientations of Feiman-Nemser have taken on fresh dimensions. The new teaching modes necessitate appropriate training for all teacher-educators working in distance-teaching in accordance with their academic disciplines. The research findings\ncontribute to the reduction of a gap in knowledge concerning the new teaching modes of teacher-educators teaching distance-learning in a teacher-training college in Israel.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bar-Tal, Smadar"],"dc:date":"2011-03-01T09:26:18Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Ball.

However increasing urbanisation means much of the suitable tit habitat is represented by fragmented areas, not large woodlands, and little is known about factors that may affect reproductive success in urban environments. Using General and Generalised Linear Models this study compared reproductive performance in four habitat types with differing levels of\nhabitat modification: the Cambridge University Botanic Garden (CUBG) with an abundance of non-native vegetation and structural fragmentation, two marginal sites with native scrubby vegetation and structural\nfragmentation and small fragments and large fragments of native woodland. Compositional analysis was used in a study focused on how foraging blue tits used the heterogeneous habitat of the CUBG. Additionally\nfrequency tests were used to compare foraging preferences and foraging behaviours of both species in the CUBG.\nProductivity was poor in the CUBG compared to all of the other habitats, with great tits appearing to do worse than blue tits, rearing lower quality chicks (significantly lower mean mass than in other habitats). Within the CUBG, positive relationships were found between the abundance of native trees and shrubs and breeding success for both blue tits and great tits. A positive relationship was found between breeding success in blue tits and the abundance of Quercus and Betula. However, habitat and year interactions showed that habitat and\nreproductive relationships were complicated by annual variation. The two species differed in their foraging preferences in the CUBG; blue tits were observed feeding in native deciduous trees significantly more than in non-native species and had a preference for birch trees over other taxa. Great tits however showed no strong\npreferences for any of the habitat types. With regards to foraging behaviours, great tits used a wider range of foraging heights and different foraging locations and capture techniques than blue tits. Blue tits were observed‘hanging’ from twigs more frequently, and appeared to be more effective at foraging in the wider variety of\nplants available in the heterogeneous vegetation of the garden. The data presented in this thesis suggest that blue tits have adopted a better foraging strategy by preferentially choosing native deciduous trees over the abundance of non-natives available in the CUBG. However, despite the apparent better foraging strategy of\nblue tits, reproductive performance of both species is poor in this urban garden compared to marginal sites and woodland. Urbanisation and the associated loss of optimal tit habitat are likely to continue. It is therefore important to offset urbanisation by the addition of appropriate foraging habitats that are likely to improve\nreproductive success, such as native trees and shrubs.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacKenzie, Julia"],"dc:date":"2011-03-01T10:14:51Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Bourgault, P Perret and M M Lambrechts.

The purpose of this study has been twofold: 1) to confront conflicting issues that exist between the need for change in teacher pedagogy and the resistance felt by many of them toward ‘never ending’ new reforms and: 2). to investigate the impact of the mentoring model (MM) on learning processes that foster teacher empowerment.  Assessment of empowerment, as both a process and a product, drew on the teachers\u0027 metacognitive development, growing sense of satisfaction and self-efficacy as mediators of their pupils\u0027 thinking/learning skills.\n\nThis study presents a unique approach to teacher empowerment through its theoretical and methodological perspectives.  Socio-cultural perspectives serve as an over-arching framework through which various theoretical perspectives for learning and development may be integrated.  Action research and discourse analysis were found to be compatible with the researcher’s philosophical approach, whereby educators engage in a collaborative learning process that promotes shared visions and goals.  Promoting the characteristics of a learning organisation within the school shed light on ways that can provide teachers with a nurturing environment within the complex dynamics of the school.  The detailed account and interpretation of the multi-level reciprocal interactions that occur between teachers, mentor and the school organisation presented in this study is especially significant for understanding multidimensional developmental processes.  It illustrates the evolution of inventive methodological tools (such as skills rubrics and discourse analysis techniques), which assume to provide new perspectives for fostering the teachers’ trust in their own judgement when mediating higher order thinking skills. These findings are of particular relevance as contemporary research indicates that teachers often experience difficulties in practicing metacognitive pedagogy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Margolin, Tiki"],"dc:date":"2011-03-01T10:16:30Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H G Andrade.

{"identifier":114132,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Book"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The eyes of your heart: literary and theological trajectories of imagining biblically","bibo:abstract":"This book develops a theory of imagining biblically that explores the contributions scripture can make to a new way of thinking about creativity, reading, interpretation, and criticism. The methodology employed in order to demonstrate this thesis consists of a theoretical exploration of current theological understandings of the \"imagination\" and their implications within the fields of literary studies. The biblical texts locates the function generally defined as \"imagination\" in the heart (\"the eyes of your heart,\" Ephesians 1:18). This book assesses what the biblical text as a literary and religious document contributes to the concept of \"imagination.\" Due to the eclectic nature of the individual books that comprise the scriptural canon, the text is considered primarily in terms of its overarching metanarrative, language, genres, and theological propositions. Tracing the various trajectories the biblical text opens up and the ways in which they intersect with and modify post-Romantic assumptions about the imagination reconfigures traditional definitions of this concept. A Calvinistic, evangelical hermeneutic is deployed to establish a theoretical concept of what it means to \"imagine biblically.\" This is further substantiated by a comparative study of authors ranging from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries (John Bunyan, Samuel Rutherford, Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, and C. S. Lewis). Each author\u0027s chapter incorporates a close reading of a key text which concretely examines various trajectories of imagining biblically, including creativity, faith, morals, narrative, Romanticism, and eschatology. The conclusion returns to the biblical text and draws these elements together, with a definition of the concept of imagining biblically and its implications for literary studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Searle, Alison"],"dc:date":"2011-03-23T12:42:18Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387215,"sim:weight":0.224003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98946,"sim:weight":0.212066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352240,"sim:weight":0.201298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98693,"sim:weight":0.19426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.181084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77302,"sim:weight":0.178472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.174136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387369,"sim:weight":0.173174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48335,"sim:weight":0.172441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98928,"sim:weight":0.168688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43036,"sim:weight":0.16363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45027,"sim:weight":0.158582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99127,"sim:weight":0.150865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631105,"sim:weight":0.137429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.133047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43779,"sim:weight":0.129708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75729,"sim:weight":0.129584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352178,"sim:weight":0.122885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75552,"sim:weight":0.121663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2826,"sim:weight":0.0772564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A linguistic vitality and language usage questionnaire adapted from Yagmur, and Yagmur and Akinci, capturing domain-specific language use as well as respondents\u0027 perception of their own and other ethnolinguistic groups, was completed by 58 migrants from new European Union member states. Data analysis uncovers three themes: first, language use is domain-specific, with preferences for the L1 in the home/family domain only, and L2 English being the language of choice elsewhere; second, there are low perceptions of ethnolinguistic vitality of the L1 group across the sample; and third, there is initial evidence for a potential longitudinal shift in language use as a result of an integrative attitude to migration by the respondents and long-term plans to reside in the UK from the outset.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rasinger, Sebastian M."],"dc:date":"2011-03-22T14:09:20Z","doi":"10.1080/01434630903582706","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108366,"sim:weight":0.351908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382759,"sim:weight":0.31232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768579,"sim:weight":0.292957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43239,"sim:weight":0.290739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9023059,"sim:weight":0.290002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108231,"sim:weight":0.282048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48397,"sim:weight":0.262271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.258781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105020,"sim:weight":0.256519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108205,"sim:weight":0.252408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43313,"sim:weight":0.25025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98727,"sim:weight":0.246232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98855,"sim:weight":0.245675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108961,"sim:weight":0.244391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47037,"sim:weight":0.242391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85336,"sim:weight":0.232865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.23265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43936,"sim:weight":0.220473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43321,"sim:weight":0.21658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5083264,"sim:weight":0.205482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This book furthers knowledge of Romantic period culture by providing new and provocative information on canonical poets such as Byron, Lamb, and Shelley alongside anonymous poets, pamphleteers, balladeers and publishing pirates, by focusing on their relationship with contemporary political events. In a period when only 5% of the population could vote, poetry and politics became inseparable as disparate groups of poets struggled to control the representation of the most dramatic revolutionary events of the day. Consequently the gulf that separated \u0027high\u0027 literature from the literature of the streets shrank to allow a glimpse of a new kind of writing that denied the possibility of literary stratification, and, for this very reason, threatened the stratified society out of which it had been produced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gardner, John"],"dc:date":"2011-09-20T09:20:53Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382067,"sim:weight":0.258812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631563,"sim:weight":0.232478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105181,"sim:weight":0.207257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43533,"sim:weight":0.196362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48412,"sim:weight":0.193703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.188953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43613,"sim:weight":0.186089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383636,"sim:weight":0.174649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99025,"sim:weight":0.1685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98899,"sim:weight":0.167708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.166224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44647,"sim:weight":0.165745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2924,"sim:weight":0.165329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46605,"sim:weight":0.165317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.162784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.159384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81320,"sim:weight":0.159234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352178,"sim:weight":0.158907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99504,"sim:weight":0.15439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.153654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Die Fülle leicht zugänglicher populärwissenschaftlicher Beiträge wächst demgegenüber sehr schnell an und trägt dazu bei, eine insgesamt äußerst begrenzte bis fehlerhafte Interpretationsgrundlage zu verbreiten, die Lola Rennt als Film über „Schicksal“, „Zufall“, „Glück“ und existentielle Probleme zeitgenössischer Jugendlicher fokussiert. Der folgende Beitrag bemüht sich um eine Erweiterung und Korrektur solcher Interpretationsvorlagen, indem er das beachtliche Spektrum der im Film thematisierten ihm aber auch immanenten zeitgenössischen Hybriditätsaspekte erarbeitet. Hierbei wird deutlich, dass die mechanische, von Zeitdruck und Stress geprägte Lebenswelt der Protagonisten keinesfalls für ein anthropologisch oder religiös fundiertes „Fatum“ sondern vielmehr für einen normativ und diskursiv angelegten und darum grundsätzlich abwendbaren Kausalitätsexzess symbolisch ist. Um so bedeutsamer wird das Spannungsfeld zwischen Selbst- und Fremdbestimmung, das die Protagonisten exemplarisch vorführen. In diesem Kontext rekonstruiert Lola Rennt stereotypische Generationskonflikte, um diese mittels Parodisierung zu dekonstruieren.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rings, Guido"],"dc:date":"2011-03-23T12:51:53Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":463166,"sim:weight":0.514078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1015857,"sim:weight":0.503582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":481018,"sim:weight":0.503134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":480964,"sim:weight":0.49871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":800005,"sim:weight":0.490094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":766421,"sim:weight":0.487008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":602430,"sim:weight":0.483619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":519741,"sim:weight":0.481615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":709620,"sim:weight":0.480624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":707138,"sim:weight":0.477803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":683215,"sim:weight":0.476824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":519747,"sim:weight":0.47529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":519752,"sim:weight":0.474655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":519763,"sim:weight":0.468313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":519748,"sim:weight":0.467775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":506029,"sim:weight":0.467264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":528418,"sim:weight":0.465556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":519756,"sim:weight":0.465508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":757373,"sim:weight":0.463724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99393,"sim:weight":0.462843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It investigates the design and development of such interfaces in the light of these\nexperiences and presents material from two of these custom interfaces.\nThe work examines the nature of digital interfaces for musical expression through the use of multiple sensors, the data from which is used to generate and control multiple musical parameters in software. This enables levels of expression and diversity not generally available using conventional electronic interfaces, the latter frequently being limited to the direct control of a\nlimited number of musical parameters. The combination of hardware design and algorithmic manipulation combined with the expressive potential of dance and embodied movement is of particular interest.\nReflecting links between embodied movement and expression in live performance, the feedback between form and function is also considered, as are collaborations with sculptors to develop and enhance the physical behaviour and visual appearance of these devices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hoadley, Richard"],"dc:date":"2011-04-21T15:13:34Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44235,"sim:weight":0.341869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91213,"sim:weight":0.318539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59326,"sim:weight":0.292451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269920,"sim:weight":0.285048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57363,"sim:weight":0.272756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.265665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652988,"sim:weight":0.252684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18917,"sim:weight":0.245898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708251,"sim:weight":0.242933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13147,"sim:weight":0.237244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":398101,"sim:weight":0.22991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101399,"sim:weight":0.2269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101626,"sim:weight":0.216793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43823,"sim:weight":0.215942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101205,"sim:weight":0.214873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43099,"sim:weight":0.208026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102660,"sim:weight":0.207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101195,"sim:weight":0.206283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101550,"sim:weight":0.203794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Such techniques confirm film’s profound affinities with the so-called ‘static’ media of painting and photography, but also foreground what Laura Mulvey calls the ‘fundamental, and irreconcilable, opposition between stillness and movement’ that defines filmic materiality and distinguishes it from other visual arts (2006: 67). This chapter engages with some of these questions in relation to Ratcatcher’s DVD format, to look in particular at the stills gallery feature. The DVD format brings another form of visibility to the film’s wider narrative and aesthetic interest in stillness as the still-moving binary inherent in celluloid is displaced onto, and remediated by, the electronic screen. Drawing from debates about intermediality and digital spectatorship, this chapter considers how the stills gallery participates in Ratcatcher’s questioning of aesthetic polarities, challenging divisions between ‘old’ and ‘new’ media. In tadem, it considers in particular the ways in which the distinctive textual properties and features of DVD – such as interactivity, electronic displays, stills galleries, commentaries, ‘making of’ featurettes, short films, and so forth – may be said to transform the experience of spectatorship and its spatial and temporal framing. By foregrounding and embracing the material hybridity and intermedial potential of both still and moving images, Ratcatcher points toward the emergence of what Laura Mulvey, D.N. Rodowick (2007), and other scholars have identified as a new ontology in which, to quote Mulvey, ‘ambivalence, impurity and uncertainty displace […] traditional oppositions’ (2006: 12). More specifically, I argue that the stills gallery feature insists on an experience of the uncanny that is given renewed importance in an era of digital spectatorship.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kendall, Tina"],"dc:date":"2011-04-21T15:07:41Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2710584,"sim:weight":0.255232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99028,"sim:weight":0.240321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.238382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47288,"sim:weight":0.232562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98480,"sim:weight":0.231777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.227272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99117,"sim:weight":0.227232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46627,"sim:weight":0.223709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.22054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.219369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.218813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.213641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709961,"sim:weight":0.205872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710586,"sim:weight":0.201518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931320,"sim:weight":0.198742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352166,"sim:weight":0.195945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103424,"sim:weight":0.193781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.192123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88606,"sim:weight":0.19143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931412,"sim:weight":0.191426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The film is made up of two portraits of the musician one shot in B\u0026W and the other in colour. The film was first screened in July 2010 at an all day event of improvised music curated by Evan Parker in Whitstable Kent. The film has also been shown at The Leeds International Film Festival in 2010. Evan Parker is one of the major figures in European free improvisation. Over the course of the last 40 years he has developed a new musical language for the saxophone, particularly the soprano. Parker’s style makes use of a number of techniques one of which being circular breathing. This allows him to play for great stretches of time without pausing for breath, creating long passages of uninterrupted sound. The speed of Parker’s playing creates notes on top of notes, counterpoint on top of counterpoint.","bibo:AuthorList":["Henderson, Neil"],"dc:date":"2011-05-26T11:25:45Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.254904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58923,"sim:weight":0.253185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44390,"sim:weight":0.223312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.214461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.211526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57573,"sim:weight":0.186825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47309,"sim:weight":0.18353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46714,"sim:weight":0.179485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.173299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145834,"sim:weight":0.161164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.150483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52925,"sim:weight":0.14816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":625650,"sim:weight":0.144406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43304,"sim:weight":0.144317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.142822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16761,"sim:weight":0.140341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43379,"sim:weight":0.13831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104693,"sim:weight":0.135781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2927,"sim:weight":0.130204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43183,"sim:weight":0.128725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The second section draws on evidence from a collective case study of 11 newly qualified childcare and education workers, employed in three different early years settings.\n\nFindings from this research indicate that informal observant practice is very meaningful and enhances relationships with children, families and colleagues. However, this is not often reflected in the formal documenting of observations, which are focused upon monitoring the progress of individuals and therefore have limited use in developing children’s care and learning.

The book locates these musicians in a hyphenated ‘Irish-Englishness’ marked by ‘in-between-ness’ and explores the different ways that they engaged with this in-betweenness through their creative work and their engagements with audiences, the media and the music industry.\n\n\nThe book draws on extensive archival research of print and audio-visual media as well as original interviews with the key figures, including Shane MacGowan, Johnny Marr, Kevin Rowland and Cáit O’Riordan. Combining its assiduous research with fresh critical insights, the book offers new analyses of the musicians, as well as previously undocumented accounts of their lives and work. The book highlights the diversity and complexity of second-generation Irish identities and experience and details the diverse ways in which this generation has shaped popular music in England. Accessible and original, ‘Irish Blood, English Heart’ will be of interest to students and scholars in the fields of popular music, media/cultural studies, and ethnic/migration studies.

Today, public and critical appreciation of The Smiths is at its height, yet arguably the most important British band since The Beatles have rarely been subject to sustained academic scrutiny. Why pamper life\u0027s complexities? Essays on The Smiths seeks to remedy this by bringing together scholars from diverse academic disciplines dealing with a range of social, cultural and political concerns that shed new light on the band.\n\nTopics covered in the essays range from class, race, sexuality, Catholicism, Thatcherism, regional and national identities, to cinema, musical poetics, suicide and fandom. Lyrics, interviews, the city of Manchester, cultural iconography and the cult of Morrissey are all considered anew. The essays breach the standard confines of music history, rock biography and pop culture studies to give a sustained critical analysis of the band that is timely and illuminating.\n\nThis book will be of interest to scholars and students in the fields of sociology, literature, geography, cultural and media studies. It is also intended for a wider audience of those interested in the enduring appeal of this most complex and controversial of bands. Accessible and original, these essays will help to contextualise the lasting cultural legacy of The Smiths.","bibo:AuthorList":["Campbell, Sean","Coulter, Colin"],"dc:date":"2011-05-25T15:41:55Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101628,"sim:weight":0.240998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.240282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.22866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89116,"sim:weight":0.217801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53655,"sim:weight":0.216473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929886,"sim:weight":0.213684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383665,"sim:weight":0.210888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381994,"sim:weight":0.198652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.192998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.19288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46639,"sim:weight":0.190775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352182,"sim:weight":0.185615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99117,"sim:weight":0.17768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46605,"sim:weight":0.175306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.174058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102660,"sim:weight":0.173956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.17218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312663,"sim:weight":0.171373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47567,"sim:weight":0.163079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99032,"sim:weight":0.157733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

How do practitioners’ experiences of higher education transform and influence curriculum provision for young children?\nThis paper brings together literature on changes to early years in England to consider how these in turn may influence what forms professional development may take for early years practitioners. The possible forms of professional development and their potential will be considered within a wider discourse of transformation centred on the practitioner as ‘agent of change’. How these are developed within the context of practitioners’ experiences of higher education will be explored in the final part of the paper. The first part of the paper considers the changing policy context and the growth of new and existing forms of early years provision in England and how this sets the workforce agenda by government. The emphasis from research has been on the importance of high quality provision led by qualified staff. Here the practitioners’ role is seen as pivotal to the development of children’s learning and well-being; and to the success of integrating care and education. The second part highlights how evidence on effective pedagogical practices is now part of the discourse for professional development. This further raises issues to do with leadership of practice and what form this may take in early years.\nThe final part of the paper will consider continuous professional development focusing on practitioners’ experiences of higher education and how these may influence their practice. Clegg cautions how academic development in higher education has been set within a managerialist discourse of practice. She proposes the use of models of workplace learning which actively engage users in reflective practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Such, Christine","Druce, Julia A."],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T08:33:30Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.401591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146086,"sim:weight":0.372381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48240,"sim:weight":0.350465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.325793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":741,"sim:weight":0.322264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653284,"sim:weight":0.320346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.317488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.315332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87648,"sim:weight":0.305358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106355,"sim:weight":0.302733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98709,"sim:weight":0.300731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55754,"sim:weight":0.290248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334982,"sim:weight":0.284646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.282409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.277644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.275336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98881,"sim:weight":0.271701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.269647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.267952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53021,"sim:weight":0.267828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Forest School is impacting on early years provision in the UK, valuing an engagement with wilder spaces. It is still less pervasive than the Friluftsliv tradition in Sweden and Norway, Udeskole in Denmark, which seem to symbolise a love of the environment embedded into the culture of those countries. In other countries, particularly the “developed” ones, many academics and practitioners are concerned to re-engage children with natural places, seeing this as a link to health and well-being, as well as engaging children with issues around climate change and respect for the environment. In less “developed” countries many children still spend significant periods of their days outside and there is a tension between a desire for progress and recognition of the value of what exists. In my research I am concerned to explore what the dominant models of outdoor experiences in the early years are in different countries, why are they there, and what can they tell us about the importance of outdoor experiences to young children. I am trying to collect the different methods by which practitioners and academics validate what they are doing, with a view to comparing them to find a valid model with which to influence policy-makers. At the conference I am keen to share my research so far, and to engage with colleagues from around the world in a discussion about “nature-deficit disorder”, about the Forest School movement, and about the importance of engaging young children with their environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Knight, Sara A."],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T08:48:19Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":3213,"sim:weight":0.420235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.402894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.392899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45858,"sim:weight":0.33744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.333324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48240,"sim:weight":0.324957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.322436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.318939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.316652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.297011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269897,"sim:weight":0.296375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.29351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914780,"sim:weight":0.292812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50140,"sim:weight":0.29238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43306,"sim:weight":0.282478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47157,"sim:weight":0.27806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145780,"sim:weight":0.27511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.271258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48316,"sim:weight":0.269928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.267073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":114202,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Father Christmas: just a story?","bibo:abstract":"The present paper aims to discuss parental and professionals\u0027 views toward the Father Christmas story--who also known as Santa Claus (in America and many other countries), Saint Nicholas (in the Netherlands), Saint Basil the Great (in Greece)--and to explore the potential of the story for young children\u0027s spiritual growth. Stories are often told because of their entertaining nature, however, their value goes beyond entertainment. Stories allow individuals to express an emotion in a satisfying way, to harmonise their lives with reality and to come to terms with the world. Stories are often told to offer some explanation for existing phenomena or customs. The discussion in this paper is based on the findings of a study undertaken among parents of young children (phase one) and Early Years professionals (phase two) to investigate their attitudes and practices toward the Father Christmas story. The research findings have shown that parents tend to agree that the Father Christmas story conveys values with some kind of universal acceptance such as generosity, kindness and caring. Additionally parents themselves use the story to transmit social and personal values and to facilitate their children\u0027s ability to make sense of the self and the world. These elements and children\u0027s experience of excitement and the sense of magic, wonder and awe which the Father Christmas story generates were seen by parents as being extremely important. Early Years professionals acknowledge similar issues, but not so strongly as parents. Early Years professionals tend to place the Father Christmas story below curricular demands and in consequence show ambivalence about the place of the Father Christmas story in educational settings. The values of generosity, kindness and caring were more likely to be associated with the religious celebration of Christmas by Early Years professionals than with the Father Christmas story. These findings will be discussed in relation to their implications for practice in Early Years education settings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Papatheodorou, Theodora","Gill, Janet"],"dc:date":"2011-04-20T15:39:25Z","doi":"10.1080/1364436022000023220","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60260,"sim:weight":0.258884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.253005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43996,"sim:weight":0.250157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.249155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383650,"sim:weight":0.244285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.242233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98693,"sim:weight":0.240837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17849,"sim:weight":0.235614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84849,"sim:weight":0.234977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145629,"sim:weight":0.230095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.226919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82298,"sim:weight":0.224531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45858,"sim:weight":0.220831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77112,"sim:weight":0.21768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48240,"sim:weight":0.207368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57213,"sim:weight":0.19728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382095,"sim:weight":0.196455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99118,"sim:weight":0.192686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.192395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383571,"sim:weight":0.188834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A program entitled \u0027Learning Together\u0027 was developed, drawing on the principles of socio-cultural theory and developmentally appropriate practice that underpin the pedagogical praxis in early childhood. The program was implemented in a Greek community school located in England. The project followed an ethnographic case-study methodology.

Twelve five-six year old children from a state funded primary school in south-east England and fifteen five-six year old children from a university campus school in north India formed the sample for the study. Three different methods for collecting qualitative data were used: (a) children\u0027s drawings (b) children\u0027s paired interviews and (c) photographic/video evidence of different areas of the class/setting, taken/videoed by children themselves. Findings from England and India, both, revealed similar results that children liked coming to school and enjoyed doing a range of activities with their teacher(s) and friends. They however, wanted to spend more time outside. Their perceptions of why they attend school ranged from adult-imposed reasons to those which might be of benefit to themselves. The main difference between the two groups was in their perceptions of the outside space and the use of school facilities. These differences could be attributed to the different socio-cultural and economic state of the settings in respective countries. These differences are understood and discussed in relation to different theoretical perspectives, as mentioned earlier.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kanyal, Mallika","Cooper, Linda"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T09:45:02Z","doi":"10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.560","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":81956,"sim:weight":0.471288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.470885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82298,"sim:weight":0.419414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.417181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710186,"sim:weight":0.414593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60325,"sim:weight":0.40675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.402918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.402811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103632,"sim:weight":0.359514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384049,"sim:weight":0.35314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102653,"sim:weight":0.353092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145972,"sim:weight":0.331194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47135,"sim:weight":0.327472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43280,"sim:weight":0.32015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381950,"sim:weight":0.289982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.282286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.281011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387068,"sim:weight":0.26848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54855,"sim:weight":0.267572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.267191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is exemplified by reference to a doctoral programme delivered by a UK-based university, largely through distance learning, to students resident in a non-anglophone country. Here, the challenges have concerned: cultural and linguistic barriers; the use of distance-based supervision; and taken-for-granted knowledge related to learning and academic levels. Anecdotal evidence suggests diverse student experiences during the supervision process, in both face-to-face and distance learning contexts, reflecting the extent of familiarity with idiomatic and technical English, and the importance of non-verbal communication. Given unequal power relations between students and university teachers, improved intercultural communicative competence may be achieved through a mutual construction of a discursive arena reflecting the dynamics of an increasingly globalized structure of academic intercourse. This may involve a critique of assumptions associated with \u0027national\u0027 academic cultures together with a pragmatic quest for a common lexicon. This in turn may contribute to the process of cross-national collaboration and cooperation in higher education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bash, Leslie"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T11:13:18Z","doi":"10.1080/14675980903371340","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":104019,"sim:weight":0.424132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46447,"sim:weight":0.370266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16185,"sim:weight":0.364349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78564,"sim:weight":0.355256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.355045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709519,"sim:weight":0.354976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.333304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386857,"sim:weight":0.332019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.329992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.326829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.323085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.316404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.31048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664559,"sim:weight":0.309104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1039562,"sim:weight":0.299239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584852,"sim:weight":0.27848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270217,"sim:weight":0.262697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.258604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26639,"sim:weight":0.254008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45653,"sim:weight":0.240167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While the starting point of our analysis is a deconstruction of ethnic/national identity in conventional terms of language, religion, education etc., the emerging focus is the notion of boundary. On the one hand, we look at the relevance of fluid boundaries for identity formation, while on the other hand, the experience of crossing boundaries will also be examined, particularly in the case of forced migration and displacement. Boundaries are conceptualised in the context of a continuum in which the experiences of refugee children range across school, home, locality and country. To illustrate the central arguments two case studies will be highlighted: a child refugee from Kosovo, the older of two brothers arriving in the UK about four years ago, who now attends a north London primary school; and several young minors, mainly from Kosovo, who attend a youth club in south London. Preliminary observations of the child, together with subsequent small group discussions and semi-structured interviews, serve to identify how the child relates to the various spaces in the school. The analysis of his drawings forms the main part of the argument. In the case of the youth club users, observations and conversations show how these young people construct their individual and social identities by accessing global resources in response to local interests.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bash, Leslie","Zezlina‐Phillips, Elena"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T11:42:28Z","doi":"10.1080/14675980500502123","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":82298,"sim:weight":0.371956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.332567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45508,"sim:weight":0.32412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47549,"sim:weight":0.322974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.318774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710639,"sim:weight":0.307372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2473,"sim:weight":0.306772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.301521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383616,"sim:weight":0.299963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48367,"sim:weight":0.284215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.279118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101388,"sim:weight":0.272767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383571,"sim:weight":0.272416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710561,"sim:weight":0.266214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.26475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.26094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.259974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710044,"sim:weight":0.241996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381950,"sim:weight":0.241513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383497,"sim:weight":0.240055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thus, it is concerned with relating the\nmetatheoretical aspects of the debate and not with the pragmatic aspects of the research and\nconcomitant methods. A deductive–inductive–deductive design, based on the theory–\nresearch–theory strategy of Meleis (1985), tested, revised and developed for nursing\nestablished health promotion theory using theory-testing criteria. To complement the\nmethodological mix, the study also used the theory (i.e. a health-promotion taxonomy) as a\nframework to contextualise the findings rather than generate theory in the way associated\nwith interpretative inquiry. While inconsistent with the traditional view linking theory testing\nwith quantitative, objective epistemology, the process enabled a theoretically robust healthpromotion\ntaxonomy to be synthesised and advanced for use in nursing in relation to a\nparadigm of social thought.","bibo:AuthorList":["Piper, Stewart"],"dc:date":"2011-05-24T15:18:47Z","doi":"10.1177/1744987106064633","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Ellis.

This paper presents the findings of grounded theory research undertaken to explore the health and illness experiences of individuals diagnosed with iNPH.  Purposive and theoretical sampling was used to recruit 26 participants who all had a confirmed diagnosis of iNPH for at least 6 months before data collection.  Data was collected through in-depth semi-structured recorded interviews (n\u003d15) and written personal biographies (n\u003d11).  Data was analysed using constant comparison and the method suggested by Glaser (1992).  Four themes emerged from the date: hope; frustration; isolation and life-long illness.  These themes are used to explore and explain the experiences of those who live with iNPH.  Greater understanding of this experience will help health care professionals to provide meaningful and effective care for patients and their families.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gelling, Leslie","McVicar, Andrew J."],"dc:date":"2011-05-26T09:31:15Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145903,"sim:weight":0.302814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.270157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643980,"sim:weight":0.247134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43782,"sim:weight":0.242648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46896,"sim:weight":0.231721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.227293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43687,"sim:weight":0.22709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.223237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99477,"sim:weight":0.220355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386691,"sim:weight":0.219988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146036,"sim:weight":0.216284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102665,"sim:weight":0.214608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.211122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.208817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145859,"sim:weight":0.204159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18013,"sim:weight":0.1984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.197691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77319,"sim:weight":0.197047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99469,"sim:weight":0.194878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":115036,"sim:weight":0.193541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Siege cultures will tend to manifest themselves in ethnocentric terms and may frequently incorporate anachronistic perspectives on social divisions. Siege cultures may therefore be said to be in a state of continual production and reproduction-indeed, of re-invention-and require the support of educational institutions organised along separatist lines. Inevitably, this will have ramifications for national education systems, which may need to respond to the pressures resulting from resistance from such cultures to the hegemony of the dominant group. Except where the central state is strong and is able to subordinate the demands of minority communities through the process of de-legitimisation or through expulsion, there will be a tendency towards unresolved tensions, conflicts and contradictions. A possible explanatory framework for this phenomenon may be derived from the metaphor of social maturation in which societies fail to change sufficiently to meet the demands of legitimate constituencies and thus inhibit the development of a properly functioning social system. This may suggest a paradigm drawn from modernist, positivistic or even Marxist traditions, and that while current trends, as viewed cross-nationally, seem to point to the rise of \u0027ethnicism\u0027, we should be alerted to the dangers of separatist schooling which reinforces the ethnocentrism of some minority communities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bash, Leslie"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T11:53:39Z","doi":"10.1080/14675980120033920","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.294527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.253534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.247343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.234196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.232457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.230743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.226086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55754,"sim:weight":0.225577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101412,"sim:weight":0.225379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.220535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.216984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44499,"sim:weight":0.211391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.209881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.209371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383497,"sim:weight":0.209099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45399,"sim:weight":0.205759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709904,"sim:weight":0.201094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47606,"sim:weight":0.200739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99028,"sim:weight":0.198699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51515,"sim:weight":0.198619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This imaging modality is a complex one and the strong\nmagnetic fields associated with MRI scanners pose a very serious risk to patients and staff.\nTherefore it is essential that MR radiographers receive appropriate training in the correct\noperation and safe use of MRI. The education of radiographers undertaking MRI\nexaminations is largely provided ‘‘in-house’’ by radiographers or applications specialists. This\ntraining is usually informal and focuses on essential safety training and the use of scanner\nsoftware. This learning is not usually formally assessed and therefore its value is not properly\nevaluated. In 2007 the authors, acting as independent consultants, developed a number of\nassessment tools to enable quick and effective evaluation of theoretical knowledge and skills\nrelated to the clinical use of MRI in a group of individuals with a range of MRI experience. A\ntotal of 47 individuals with a range of MRI experience were tested using an Objective\nStructured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Some were also given a viva voce. Our results show\nthat the majority of radiographers in our sample could not answer more than half the OSCE\nquestions correctly and a significant and unacceptable number did not convince us they could\npractice MRI safely. Very few of the examinees had adequate knowledge of image quality\nissues and parameter manipulation. A few also raised concerns over their radiographic\ncredentials.","bibo:AuthorList":["Westbrook, Catherine","Talbot, John"],"dc:date":"2011-09-22T13:35:56Z","doi":"10.1016/j.ejradi.2009.04.001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1656477,"sim:weight":0.175091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.16621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.166188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.163733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.157952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.157791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.154579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.15394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103052,"sim:weight":0.148394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.14559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56680,"sim:weight":0.144536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48414,"sim:weight":0.141954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.14151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94264,"sim:weight":0.141295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826927,"sim:weight":0.14115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.140719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.139814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99469,"sim:weight":0.136794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.134895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.13115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

During the period of popularisation of patchwork text approach teaching staff and students on the BA Learning Technology Research pathway,\nbased in the Faculty of Education at Anglia Ruskin University, have been adapting and advancing the method. They have fused the patchwork text approach with a plethora of digital technologies to create a form of assessment known as “patchwork media”. This practice based paper offers insight in to the\ncharacteristics and workings of patchwork media. Both the production of ‘patches’ and the supporting processes of online community are explored. It examines and illustrates how a fully online course has fully digitised Winter’s principles. The paper illustrates how the use of rich media can extend the benefits and possibilities of the original approach. In addition, the paper explores some of the challenges that the use of patchwork media presents to learners, teaching staff and university systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arnold, Lydia","Williams, Tim","Thompson, Kevin"],"dc:date":"2011-05-11T15:09:55Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.254192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.252491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.250351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105133,"sim:weight":0.245157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930934,"sim:weight":0.242853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160793,"sim:weight":0.242444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4152214,"sim:weight":0.236094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.235838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.234784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83543,"sim:weight":0.233553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.23303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.232266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9430072,"sim:weight":0.229513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341327,"sim:weight":0.229408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106241,"sim:weight":0.226038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5162,"sim:weight":0.225525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.22223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.220811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154791,"sim:weight":0.219111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105141,"sim:weight":0.218481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Developing themes set out in her earlier work, this article presents a rationale and developmental model for drama as narrative pedagogy. Whether narrative impairment is a cause or consequence of their difficulties, hard-to-reach or socially challenged children – exemplified by those with autism – characteristically show a limited spontaneous play repertoire, which necessarily hampers their development. However, through a play-tutoring approach in drama, especially by the teacher-in-role, significant gains may be noted. Melanie Peter uses case studies to illustrate an emerging triad of competencies that contribute to enhancing social understanding: more effective communication, greater sensitivity in interaction and creative problem-solving. The generative pedagogical dimensions support a developmental framework for using drama to explore cultural values and issues embedded in stories, towards greater narrative identity and more effective participation in a social world.","bibo:AuthorList":["Peter, Melanie"],"dc:date":"2011-05-24T14:58:31Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-8578.2009.00414.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48409,"sim:weight":0.389509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2819,"sim:weight":0.356315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47606,"sim:weight":0.342476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.325477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48240,"sim:weight":0.304124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101378,"sim:weight":0.281516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229911,"sim:weight":0.27667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.272242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160612,"sim:weight":0.256612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710589,"sim:weight":0.254726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710211,"sim:weight":0.230712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154483,"sim:weight":0.226426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98693,"sim:weight":0.220145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.208904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.206909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709915,"sim:weight":0.203619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9028057,"sim:weight":0.200314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109102,"sim:weight":0.192146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.186154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3179,"sim:weight":0.184729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We focus on the student writing experience in one compulsory Management module, (People Management: Challenges and Choices – PMCC) which was introduced as part of a broader revision of the first year Business syllabus designed to make transparent to students the discourse of Business studies and of Higher Education more generally. Against the background of Business Students entering higher education with increasing diverse biographies, expectations and constraints, many Business Schools have recently embarked on re-designing large parts of the curriculum. Our findings give impetus to future syllabus and pedagogical changes which will make the reading experience of first-year students more rewarding and also more formative for their future development as students where they will be expected to read more extensively.","bibo:AuthorList":["Emmanuel, Myrtle","Holley, Debbie","Johnson, Linda","O’Neill, Peter","Sinfield, Sandra"],"dc:date":"2011-04-21T14:55:08Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J C Bean.

{"identifier":114243,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Conference Paper"],"bibo:shortTitle":"From parent to practitioner: alternative pathways to professionalism","bibo:abstract":"This paper argues for continuing diversity in the training of childcare practitioners. It considers childcare training from the perspective of a group of mature women entering the sector as parents, revealing how some drift into childcare work because it is convenient, allowing them to extend their personal and professional lives whilst continuing to care for their own children. Although the commitment to a childcare career may be a gradual one, the research shows how the women’s broader experience of life and of motherhood enriches the lives of the children with whom they work, supporting the creation of strong community ties; a form of localized social capital rarely acknowledged but vital to children, to families and to society.\nThe contemporary focus within the UK early years sector is on professionalization of the workforce but this paper takes a sociological perspective and travels in the opposite direction. It asks policy makers to stop for a moment and consider what might be lost if an instrumental approach to raising standards is relentlessly pursued. It is not arguing against higher quality provision, quite the reverse, but seeking to reveal some of the hidden benefits arising when women are allowed a less direct route into the profession, one that integrates their personal and family needs, and allows them simultaneously to be part-time mothers, students and workers.\nThe paper is based on a doctoral study that collected background information by questionnaire from 150 students who trained over a ten-year period. It invited a sample of 33 to explore what adult education meant to them personally. The research used informal interviews but also close listening and focused intervention to clarify meaning. Considerable attention was paid to hesitations, juxtapositions and contradictions in the narratives, during the interviews and on transcription, to make visible tacit understandings.\nStudents were specifically asked to reflect on the expectations, experiences and consequences of enrolment on a Diploma in childcare, and, given the vocational nature of the course, it was anticipated that the interviews would be career-oriented. However, in practice they demonstrated a focus on present lives that suggests that childcare training can do far more than develop subject-specific skills. The students’ focus on their current ‘beings’ and ‘doings’ led to the adoption of Amartya Sen’s capability approach as this is framework concerned with daily living, particularly the exercise of individual choice. The application of this concept added depth to the understanding of the broader outcomes from childcare training, allowing a conclusion that learning to work with children is important to the students themselves, their families, the local community and the wider society but that ultimately these additional benefits also advantage the children attending day-care.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wright, Hazel R."],"dc:date":"2011-04-26T15:09:56Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.393321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383540,"sim:weight":0.382814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78564,"sim:weight":0.382164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709519,"sim:weight":0.381958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.381903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18050,"sim:weight":0.370163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.367551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58972,"sim:weight":0.362157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.356661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.348207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101388,"sim:weight":0.348077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.34587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.344086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146054,"sim:weight":0.333876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.331616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.322065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101275,"sim:weight":0.314927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.314847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383650,"sim:weight":0.309811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.306712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I wanted to explore the\ninterpretative paradigm in depth in addition to adopting an interdisciplinary approach to\nmy research.

The reasons behind such decisions form the background to this paper.\nThe research topic was a case study of a group of mature adult women returning to\neducation to train in childcare. Data capture required retrospective recall so, of necessity,\nthe major research strategy was that of interview but the flexibility gained through\nresearching students already known to me, allowed a degree of experimentation with the\ninterview techniques, particularly a shift from semi-structured to conversational style to\nfree-association interviewing. This required a means to evidence the nuances within the\ndiscourse, met by the adoption of conversation analysis techniques at the transcription\nstage. Immersion in the data allowed a holistic interpretation. This led to thematic\nanalysis, the development of typologies and creation of localized theory, and then to the\nadoption of the capability approach as a conceptual framework taking the theorization to\nhigher levels of refinement, demonstrating that my trust in the process was founded.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wright, Hazel R."],"dc:date":"2011-05-11T15:25:26Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383540,"sim:weight":0.286018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.267036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269897,"sim:weight":0.264283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.263651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351681,"sim:weight":0.258732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.258185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18050,"sim:weight":0.257636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387695,"sim:weight":0.252262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.252157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.251052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664520,"sim:weight":0.24925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.24902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17991,"sim:weight":0.248644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.24803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.247785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656477,"sim:weight":0.244787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45818,"sim:weight":0.241854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.238559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.236968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45163,"sim:weight":0.236943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The relevant literature covers three themes: technology diffusion, the technology acceptance model and task-technology fit. To explore the significance of these models to a teaching environment case study research was undertaken within a university college in north-west England. Using an ethnographic approach, with semi-structured interviews, lecturers\u0027 attitudes to the adoption of ICT were surfaced. Then the data collected was analysed by categorising the findings. One technique used to present these findings is the translation of the dialogue of each respondent into another character. This defamiliarised the taken for granted aspects of the informants’ response. Using this method respondents were categorised using two metaphors suggesting that staff can be classified within two different cultures. The first metaphor is that of the Frontier where the adoption of ICT is seen as an exploration and the discourse used relates to the relative desire for adoption of ICT. The second metaphor is that of the Frontline where the view of ICT adoption centres on attack and defence and the discourse relates to the differences in the perceived ease of adoption.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gilbert, Jenny","Kelly, Rebecca"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T09:39:28Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18074,"sim:weight":0.359406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3167,"sim:weight":0.27566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.241515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.239168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.239057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.236366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102655,"sim:weight":0.235071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53021,"sim:weight":0.229869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.227015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664532,"sim:weight":0.217761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710085,"sim:weight":0.216478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.209803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.209803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.209803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.209803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.209803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.209803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.209803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.209803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.209803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These have developed over the centuries and universities have recently responded to the agenda of New Public Management which endeavours to replace bureaucratic and inflexible management practices with innovative and entrepreneurial management. This has been achieved by focussing on outputs or targets promoting competition and defining clients as customers. In education this has led to a culture of performativity, the creation of league tables and competition between universities. Across Europe it has led to setting of minimum standards and the introduction of state surveillance through quality assurance systems.\n\nWhile globalization has resulted in the creation of one economic space and markets have integrated and gained power, nation states have fragmented and the disparity between the haves and the have-nots has increased. This effect is most clearly seen in developing countries. We briefly outline the configuration and the values of higher education in Sri Lanka and then present a case study exploring the partnership between a UK university and a Sri Lankan training institution. This involves the delivery, using a flying faculty model, of a top-up year to honours degree for students holding an Edexel HND in Computing.

The criteria used by students when expressing satisfaction are: synergy between theory and practice; specific subject themes; discussion forums and other student interaction; and, other learning support. The themes that are associated with dissatisfaction include: robustness and usability of platform; access to resources (such as articles and books); currency of study materials; and, student work scheduling. Aspects of the student learning experience that should inform the development of e-learning include: each student engages differently; printing means that students use the integrated learning environment as a menu; discussion threads and interaction are appreciated, but students are unsure in making contributions; and, expectations about the tutor\u0027s role in e-learning are unformed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gilbert, Jenny","Morton, Susan","Rowley, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28T09:35:28Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00723.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1342505,"sim:weight":0.471421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.460209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.442818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.442635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.441144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.436081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.43501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1765,"sim:weight":0.434235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14388,"sim:weight":0.427889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14087,"sim:weight":0.427688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105141,"sim:weight":0.421167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":285114,"sim:weight":0.416686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631728,"sim:weight":0.397134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.394089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82438,"sim:weight":0.392379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76053,"sim:weight":0.388038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.386876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.368545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.367712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104859,"sim:weight":0.367439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Technological\ndevelopments are one of the many causal factors for change in the organisation and use of space.\nThis paper explores the impact that technology adoption has had on space utilisation in universities.\nUsing case studies, together with vignettes from the author’s personal experience, the impact that\ntechnology has had on space organisation is tracked. Most universities need to adopt new\ntechnologies and adapt their buildings to those already available rather than attempt to predict future\ntechnologies.

{"identifier":114250,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Personalized learning and the Ultraversity experience","bibo:abstract":"This paper describes a model of personalized work-integrated learning that is collaborative in nature, uses emerging Internet technologies and is accessed fully online. The Ultraversity project was set up by Ultralab at Anglia Ruskin University to develop a fully online, 3-year duration, undergraduate degree programme with an emphasis on action inquiry in the workplace. The course design aimed to provide a highly personalized and collaborative experience. Students engage in the processes of inquiry together as a cohort, making it possible to collaborate and support each other in the online communities. The focus of this paper is on three aspects of personalization: students\u0027 use of technological infrastructure to develop online communities; integration of study in the workplace; and the work-study-life balance. Students were surveyed and interviewed after completion through questionnaire, telephone and face-to-face meeting. Transcripts were analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. This grounded approach provided evidence of impact of the design on personalized learning. The course design made the assumption that blended learning was not necessary to ensure a rich learning experience and would be a barrier to those who could not attend, and this decision is vindicated by the accounts of participants. It was also confirmed that facilitated online communities can be used to support deep learning that is focussed on action inquiry in diverse and individual workplaces. The course was designed to impact on both the work practices of the individual and the wider institution. Participants reported this as a strength. Overall, the evidence presented shows that a course design that emphasizes a high degree of trust in students\u0027 ability to self-manage learning can lead to a challenging, personalized and rewarding online student experience. Students demonstrated high levels of competence in managing work, study and life. This assertion is further borne out by the high degree of success achieved in terms of outcomes, judged by the degree results obtained by the cohort studied.","bibo:AuthorList":["Powell, Stephen","Tindal, Ian","Millwood, Richard"],"dc:date":"2011-05-24T13:52:06Z","doi":"10.1080/10494820701772710","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.483145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.469327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.46414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.462022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104855,"sim:weight":0.461676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.457165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.451026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631728,"sim:weight":0.441835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.423491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85720,"sim:weight":0.416084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105133,"sim:weight":0.41295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.408715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.407487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105141,"sim:weight":0.406543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1344660,"sim:weight":0.386881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.38451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98881,"sim:weight":0.376378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.374619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44146,"sim:weight":0.374369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78564,"sim:weight":0.368515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article examines their perceptions in relation to interprofessional working and its impact on service provision and practice.\n\nAlthough teething problems were experienced in establishing the interprofessional working necessary for success, a shared commitment to the CMP ethos enabled these to be largely overcome. Outstanding issues raised by participants concerned the boundaries around the CMPs’ new ways of working, in particular around treatment versus self-management and around the combined health and work focus of the pilots. \n\nOne of the recommendations from Dame Carol Black’s recent review of the health of Britain’s working population was for a drive to promote the understanding of the positive relationship between health and work. The experiences of the staff involved in the CMP pilots provides a useful insight into the benefits and difficulties experienced in relation to interprofessional working between different professional groups in this area.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pittam, Gail","Secker, Jenny","Ford, Fiona"],"dc:date":"2011-06-15T15:24:06Z","doi":"10.3109/13561821003590831","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":80894,"sim:weight":0.503807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65243,"sim:weight":0.447414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88253,"sim:weight":0.417945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383670,"sim:weight":0.317989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1923685,"sim:weight":0.315854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656477,"sim:weight":0.300569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1663875,"sim:weight":0.204178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.202039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.192352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83001,"sim:weight":0.187127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85579,"sim:weight":0.185407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98472,"sim:weight":0.184526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78306,"sim:weight":0.18421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1923684,"sim:weight":0.184005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66883,"sim:weight":0.179197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.178743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.17579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.175741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99204,"sim:weight":0.173062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101277,"sim:weight":0.171216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Cement pressures were also measured distally and proximally in vitro. Results and interpretation: Our in vitro results showed poor performance of the C-plug compared with the REX and SEM II plugs. In vivo, the mean migration was least for the SEM plug and most for the C-plug. The smaller sizes performed significantly better than the larger ones for all 3 plug types. The overall in vivo performance of all 3 plug types was unsatisfactory. Differences between the SEM II and REX plugs were small and therefore not significant. The SEM II performed better than the REX, the former being much cheaper and easier to insert. The Rex plug looks promising; however, the insertion device must be improved for better results.

Results indicated significant improvements in well-being and social inclusion. Ratings of participation were very positive and supported attribution of impacts to arts participation. \n\nConclusions: While the results are promising, methodological issues limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Controlled designs would enable impacts to be attributed to arts participation with greater certainty and further research is also needed to assess longer-term impacts. Commissioners need to include evaluation in funding criteria and allocate resources for this in order to help increase response rates by ensuring data collection is adequately resourced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Secker, Jenny","Loughran, Michael F.E.","Heydinrych, Kirsten","Kent, Lyn"],"dc:date":"2011-06-15T15:26:11Z","doi":"10.1080/17533015.2010.541267","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":363904,"sim:weight":0.511344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1663875,"sim:weight":0.313104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.282606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.238565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.234323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.23368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.207815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23525,"sim:weight":0.207321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.207068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.207052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.205962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266223,"sim:weight":0.205424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99436,"sim:weight":0.202957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.202466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.199105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.193248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.19168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99079,"sim:weight":0.19088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708124,"sim:weight":0.187538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.187063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Materialise medical imaging package and I-Deas finite element (FE) software were used to create accurate geometry of a hemi-pelvis from CT-scan images. Our FE results show an increase in cement mantle stresses associated with the larger femoral head. When a 22 mm femoral head is used on acetabulae of diameters 56 mm and above, the probability of survivorship can be increased by creating a cement mantle of at least 1 mm thick. However, when a 28 mm femoral head is used, a cement mantle thickness of at least 4 mm is needed. Poor bone quality resulted in an average 45% increase in the tensile stresses of the cement mantles, indicating resulting poor survivorship rate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lamvohee, Steeve","Mootanah, Rajshree","Ingle, Paul","Cheah, Kevin","Dowell, John K."],"dc:date":"2011-06-15T15:43:02Z","doi":"10.1080/10255840902718626","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K D Kuehn, W Ege and U Gopp. (2005).

World myths, legends and fairy stories as part of early child development offer a rich source of material to draw from and enlist in the therapeutic endeavour. Fairies often act in a healing capacity in mythology, or they appear as agents between the world of human affairs and the invisible forces of nature. Mythological beings also possess helping powers in advance of mortals achieving superhuman tasks, but they can also when used as metaphor, frighten children and potentially cause psychological harm. This paper suggests that mental health practitioners can utilise such powerful narratives therapeutically and in a culturally respectful and spiritually innovative way. Harnessing the child\u0027s imagination can be a powerful vehicle for a transforming experience at the psychic level with consequent positive benefits for emotional well-being.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walker, Steven"],"dc:date":"2011-05-25T13:41:48Z","doi":"10.1080/13674670903196721","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":340902,"sim:weight":0.24477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1441356,"sim:weight":0.24477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48326,"sim:weight":0.229952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387009,"sim:weight":0.218906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98693,"sim:weight":0.213618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337728,"sim:weight":0.209328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205766,"sim:weight":0.204932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.202458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99118,"sim:weight":0.199155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101389,"sim:weight":0.198661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.194759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48336,"sim:weight":0.194333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387247,"sim:weight":0.193626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99164,"sim:weight":0.190048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222531,"sim:weight":0.186613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382095,"sim:weight":0.18455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48240,"sim:weight":0.183737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18196,"sim:weight":0.183047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101352,"sim:weight":0.181377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768020,"sim:weight":0.180935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The subsequent child guidance movement spawned the genesis of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) where social workers held a pivotal and much-respected role among multi-disciplinary teams. This role has been undermined in recent years. Post qualifying social work education and training needs to recognise and reflect the potential social work contribution to modern CAMH services to enable social workers in England and Wales to engage and contribute to supporting the increasing numbers of troubled young people. This paper sets out a rationale, knowledge base and outline content for ways in which the post qualifying social work curriculum can be developed to equip social workers with the necessary skills to engage purposively in this area.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walker, Steven"],"dc:date":"2011-05-25T14:04:43Z","doi":"10.1080/02615470903236337","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":82363,"sim:weight":0.518441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.383768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65259,"sim:weight":0.370525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653144,"sim:weight":0.356504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65257,"sim:weight":0.340485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65258,"sim:weight":0.338629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15184,"sim:weight":0.324878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98709,"sim:weight":0.321612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.319314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84011,"sim:weight":0.304615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65875,"sim:weight":0.302149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83998,"sim:weight":0.301827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48326,"sim:weight":0.286806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91320,"sim:weight":0.272154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91540,"sim:weight":0.272154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645816,"sim:weight":0.268575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.268313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65255,"sim:weight":0.26702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82092,"sim:weight":0.266691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65260,"sim:weight":0.265666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A narrative that reflects the emotional nature of moral distress is presented, with the aim of providing some answers to these questions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walsh, Aileen"],"dc:date":"2011-05-24T13:19:48Z","doi":"10.1136/jme.2010.036079","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2710304,"sim:weight":0.330075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387009,"sim:weight":0.32455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47158,"sim:weight":0.324454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98693,"sim:weight":0.319868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1649312,"sim:weight":0.227856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105077,"sim:weight":0.222859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98465,"sim:weight":0.202495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101573,"sim:weight":0.201991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104958,"sim:weight":0.200461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98489,"sim:weight":0.198972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710204,"sim:weight":0.189039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387345,"sim:weight":0.185023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98620,"sim:weight":0.180303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77375,"sim:weight":0.176711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46580,"sim:weight":0.171057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.1678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47008,"sim:weight":0.15957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99216,"sim:weight":0.158203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.157928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.154279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

How seriously do the decision-makers and opinion formers perceive traffic-related issues (and in particular the health effects of road traffic) to be in the urban areas of the UK? and, how effective and acceptable is a levy on workplace parking likely to be when compared with other policy options as a means of dealing with traffic-related pollution? Ring fencing the revenue raised from workplace parking charge would appear to be an important issue, alongside the allocation of that revenue as a means of increasing acceptance. The paper considers the size of the levy to be charged in order to achieve a significant reduction in current workplace parking provision, and the case for exempting certain categories of user.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ison, Stephen","Wall, Stuart"],"dc:date":"2011-05-24T13:47:26Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":54881,"sim:weight":0.407868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81190,"sim:weight":0.277078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54540,"sim:weight":0.262276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54230,"sim:weight":0.256151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2704,"sim:weight":0.243417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46280,"sim:weight":0.240949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81868,"sim:weight":0.237286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43355,"sim:weight":0.226916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":888,"sim:weight":0.217259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54284,"sim:weight":0.209443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1421,"sim:weight":0.208201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101248,"sim:weight":0.207561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81928,"sim:weight":0.20353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352138,"sim:weight":0.201224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43218,"sim:weight":0.199728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49832,"sim:weight":0.195979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43462,"sim:weight":0.185958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1347340,"sim:weight":0.18544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53306,"sim:weight":0.180492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43566,"sim:weight":0.176332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In response to concerted lobbying, a number of sectors and user groups have been granted exemptions from the charge. This paper explores the likely effect of congestion charging and the case for exempting construction delivery vehicles. A case study of a live construction project currently being undertaken in the city of London is used to illustrate the impact of the scheme. Based on this case example, it would seem that the impact of the scheme on construction companies has been fairly benign to date, but concerns relate to the longer term effect of charging on the future regeneration of city centres. Furthermore, it would appear that there are lessons to be learnt from the industry\u0027s apparent inability to bring to bear its collective weight to lobby for exemptions, which leaves it vulnerable to similar schemes under consideration in other cities both nationally and internationally.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ison, Stephen","Dainty, Andrew","Wall, Stuart"],"dc:date":"2011-05-24T13:33:11Z","doi":"10.1108/09699980410570157","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":49832,"sim:weight":0.482613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12252,"sim:weight":0.436501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1421,"sim:weight":0.40735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81928,"sim:weight":0.397194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43566,"sim:weight":0.395741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2704,"sim:weight":0.384465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81868,"sim:weight":0.367032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":888,"sim:weight":0.358461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46280,"sim:weight":0.288821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43499,"sim:weight":0.288371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10761,"sim:weight":0.260602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.252744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.252482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.249074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.249074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.249074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.249074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.249074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.249074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.249074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper details a survey of key UK stakeholders, namely local politicians, local transport officials and UK transport academics undertaken in order to ascertain their opinions with respect to a range of market- and non-market-based approaches aimed at dealing with the effects of road traffic in urban areas of the UK. The findings deal with how effective the key stakeholders perceive various market- and non-market based approaches to be as part of a package of measures, in dealing with the problem.

The region\u0027s success in achieving its economic targets will be assessed in terms of its inherent features and emerging strategies to move from service based on the information paradigm to those based on the consultancy paradigm.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mughan, Terry","Lloyd-Reason, Lester","Zimmerman, Carsten"],"dc:date":"2011-05-25T09:07:14Z","doi":"10.1108/00400910410569542","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100215,"sim:weight":0.275038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16273,"sim:weight":0.256835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":987464,"sim:weight":0.253825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48366,"sim:weight":0.253785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91147,"sim:weight":0.253051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91219,"sim:weight":0.251632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":756172,"sim:weight":0.246462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper also focuses on the education and training issues and policy prescriptions deemed most appropriate to medium-term goal setting in the CR.

The paper argues that the owner-manager largely determines the behavioural characteristics of SMEs, and that in turn these behavioural characteristics are determined by the cultural orientation of the owner-manager. To illustrate the key issues involved, a conceptual model, the internationalisation web, has been developed. This conceptual model can be used to understand the policy implications that emerge from the arguments and to extrapolate relevant policy recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency of the support provided to SMEs wishing to operate in foreign markets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lloyd-Reason, Lester","Mughan, Terry"],"dc:date":"2011-05-24T11:49:09Z","doi":"10.1108/14626000210427375","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91147,"sim:weight":0.322059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46854,"sim:weight":0.314718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387323,"sim:weight":0.308219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1138145,"sim:weight":0.292773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43912,"sim:weight":0.289287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101336,"sim:weight":0.273662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664532,"sim:weight":0.262603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16185,"sim:weight":0.246982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145659,"sim:weight":0.246858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383594,"sim:weight":0.234942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":284569,"sim:weight":0.234344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16273,"sim:weight":0.225516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9845,"sim:weight":0.215026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.200388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.19474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.19474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.19474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.19474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.19474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.19474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":114304,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Facilitating regeneration through new enterprise creation","bibo:abstract":"This paper undertakes a comparative study of intervention strategies and the resultant impact upon new enterprise creation in the UK and Hungary. Firstly, secondary data is used to compare and contrast the actions of, and support provided by, major employer organisations faced with the need to downsize and restructure in the light of changing economic circumstances. Parallels are drawn between the need to support the local economy in specific regions of the UK, which faced extreme recession following the decline of major industries and the need to support local economies in Hungary, which face an uncertain future, but new opportunities, following the liberalisation of economic policy. Secondly, the paper reports the results of interviews with entrepreneurs and owner-managers in both countries who have received and who are receiving support and assistance to establish, grow and develop new enterprises. For many this marks a significant transition from employment to self-employment and requires the acquisition of new skills and competences together with the acceptance of high levels of risk and exposure not previously experienced. Thirdly, the paper assesses the impact of changing relationships within the local economy. This is especially significant where newly established SMEs operate as sub-contractors to the supporting organisation which takes the opportunity to out-source services and/or production which was previously undertaken in-house. The paper concludes with specific recommendations concerning the role of facilitators in influencing attitudes towards entrepreneurship and actions, which may be undertaken to encourage regeneration through the creation of new enterprises.","bibo:AuthorList":["Illes, Katalin","Jennings, Peter L."],"dc:date":"2011-05-25T09:08:47Z","doi":"10.1504/IJEIM.2002.000495","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":16273,"sim:weight":0.314313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.302268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91147,"sim:weight":0.301936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.298085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.298032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653028,"sim:weight":0.291696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.290989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.276296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Repeatedly dealing with death, serious injury, horrific crime scenes, the need to be constantly alert whether on or off duty, and being ostracised by communities, friends and family, are only some examples of what officers encounter. All take their toll on police officers: on their health, fitness and well-being, and on their view of people and the world. The toll also extends to those who are served by these officers. While this toll is recognised, there are still high levels of sickness absence, ill health, alcohol/drug-related problems as well as suicides. These are clear illustrations of the challenging nature of policing. If we look at the deeper issues of these challenges nature of policing and its struggle for good; not being recognised as whole people; not being treated as valuable parts of a community; the reality of facing death and destructiveness on a daily basis we see that, at a fundamental level, these have a spiritual component to them. This is an important but often unrecognised aspect of policing. Forces emphasise the physical and mental well-being of officers but neglect their spiritual well-being. There are sound reasons for a greater focus on this area. It is morally appropriate to address this area. This paper draws from two PhDs. It identifies the issues related to coping strategies and officer fitness, highlights how the spiritual dimension may assist in the development of coping strategies, and identifies how these issues might be taken forward.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Jonathan A.","Charles, Ginger"],"dc:date":"2011-06-20T09:54:47Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":96024,"sim:weight":0.373754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103158,"sim:weight":0.358297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48361,"sim:weight":0.342027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383560,"sim:weight":0.313013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54165,"sim:weight":0.302259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101492,"sim:weight":0.295086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101239,"sim:weight":0.283224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102735,"sim:weight":0.27462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99118,"sim:weight":0.256271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.241928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95764,"sim:weight":0.239592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929826,"sim:weight":0.230346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":114375,"sim:weight":0.229708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383630,"sim:weight":0.225908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.216344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10479,"sim:weight":0.215985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77960,"sim:weight":0.21413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48400,"sim:weight":0.212076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107298,"sim:weight":0.208959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101389,"sim:weight":0.208595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The purpose of this paper is to offer leaders practical guidance. After providing a summary of the reasons for a leader to examine spirituality in the workplace, questions are highlighted which look at how to nurture the spiritual dimension in the workplace.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach: The authors have developed a holistic framework, and use this to guide leaders through the complexities of working with the spiritual phenomenon. They draw on their experience as leaders and on Smith\u0027s research with leaders of organisations, and his PhD, which explored the possibility of a greater spiritual focus within the UK police.\n\nFindings: Eight key questions for leaders are identified as the route through the complexities of this topic. The authors share their thoughts and the research evidence related to these questions and, while there are no easy answers, these questions can be used by the reader to help them decide for themselves what to do in the context of their own organisation.\n\nPractical implications: There are many calls for leaders to embrace the spiritual dimension in their leadership role, and many explanations as to why they should do this. However, there are a number of practical issues to be considered if this is to be done effectively, and the majority of calls do not examine these questions. This paper addresses this need and identifies the important practical questions that leaders will need to consider.\n\nOriginality/value: The paper\u0027s unique contribution is to offer a framework that incorporates the spiritual dimension into a holistic approach, and guides leaders on all the areas to consider in this approach.

{"identifier":114314,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Breaking the silence: the traumatic circle of policing","bibo:abstract":"Operational police officers often work in traumatic situations. Whilst training and support is provided to officers in these areas in the UK, and some debriefing and counselling is provided, this is not fully effective in addressing the so-called ‘attitudinal’ problem of the police. We believe that one of the reasons for this is that police training does not adequately address the effects of working in traumatic conditions, and certainly does not take into account new work in the area of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which shows that trauma, and its vicarious effects, is not necessarily a mental disorder (though its symptoms may manifest as such) but is caused by physiological and emotional changes in the body. Further, studies on the social nature of trauma indicate that it is often the isolated conditions of trauma victims that can increase PTSD. Drawing on secondary data from one of the authors’ work on spirituality in the police force, we explore the connections between the physiological and emotional aspects of trauma and the conditions in which police in the UK work. We suggest that police officers’ reports of the work they do, and the way in which they learn to live with it, keeps them in an ongoing cycle of retraumatisation. We suggest that we need to take into account the physiological, social as well as psychological (or attitudinal) aspects of working in traumatic conditions if we are to provide adequate training support for police officers, so that they are not left isolated in this cycle. This has potentially far-reaching implications for the training of police officers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rees, Bronwen A.","Smith, Jonathan A."],"dc:date":"2011-07-28T13:53:08Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101492,"sim:weight":0.606422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48245,"sim:weight":0.381797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269939,"sim:weight":0.374515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103125,"sim:weight":0.368416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351915,"sim:weight":0.356914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47284,"sim:weight":0.355312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23814,"sim:weight":0.336678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77960,"sim:weight":0.330162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43866,"sim:weight":0.329609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44021,"sim:weight":0.30911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60872,"sim:weight":0.300109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46573,"sim:weight":0.299432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98886,"sim:weight":0.260936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387247,"sim:weight":0.254648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352230,"sim:weight":0.253709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22707,"sim:weight":0.249831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1441356,"sim:weight":0.249515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340902,"sim:weight":0.249515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98864,"sim:weight":0.237158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.235783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The authors examine existing approaches to leadership with a focus on their shortcomings, categorized according to the four main types of misLeadership the authors have identified - Missing, Misguided, Misinformed and Machiavellian leadership. Each of these forms of misleadership has a corollary in one of the four elements of the kind of holistic leadership that the authors advocate - the capacity for effective decision making, the adoption of a global perspective, the move to a new business paradigm to replace the current economic and social one, and commitment to a contemporary mission. \n\nFrom the authors\u0027 perspective, leaders, the led and those responsible for leadership development will gain an insight into the prevalence and causes of misleadership and into ways in which it can be identified and overcome. A range of examples and case studies is provided to enable the concepts presented here to be related to practice. As well as illustrating instances of \u0027misleadership\u0027 these also demonstrate that the emphasis in relation to the decision making models currently available to leaders may not be the most important stages of the processes involved. \n\nThe global perspective emphasized by the authors is not just about globality in the geographical sense. An important part of the way forward suggested here involves considering all aspects of humanity - the physical, mental and spiritual strength, stamina and fitness of individuals, groups and societies, in the context of a \u0027Global Fitness Framework\u0027.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rayment, John J.","Smith, Jonathan A."],"dc:date":"2011-05-25T08:45:04Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":12984,"sim:weight":0.456497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77910,"sim:weight":0.435459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383619,"sim:weight":0.41697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43029,"sim:weight":0.369015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.319554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55249,"sim:weight":0.319449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.280047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.279353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In November 2006 the Dignity in Care Campaign was launched by Ivan Lewis, minister for care services, to stimulate debate around the issue and ‘The Dignity Challenge’ was issued to health care workers (www.dh.gov.uk/dignityincare). Dignity and respect in healthcare is everybody’s business and is an issue of concern to everyone working in the NHS. \nIn 2002, Southend University Hospital NHS Trust invited service users to an open forum to talk about their experiences of receiving healthcare from SouthendHospital. A video was made of the open-forum discussion showing both patients’ positive and negative experiences. Staff present at the forum were particularly concerned about some of the comments made as they indicated that a minority of staff were not treating their patients with the dignity and respect expected as part of the hospital’s customer care policy. The video was therefore shown to the trust managers and a planned response was agreed to address concerns raised by the patient experiences. As part of this response AngliaRuskinUniversity was invited to develop, in partnership with the trust, an accredited programme that focused on how dignity and respect can be fostered. A programme entitled ‘Fostering dignity and respect in healthcare settings’ was developed and validated in December 2003. The first cohort of students completed the programme in 2004 and the programme has been running regularly since then.","bibo:AuthorList":["Crow, Jayne","Smith, Lesley","Keenan, Iain"],"dc:date":"2011-07-28T13:07:02Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90495,"sim:weight":0.701136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59081,"sim:weight":0.483701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334784,"sim:weight":0.317989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103810,"sim:weight":0.301119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664693,"sim:weight":0.25103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.248013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.245274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.237603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85579,"sim:weight":0.236341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107949,"sim:weight":0.233014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83001,"sim:weight":0.232748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56059,"sim:weight":0.231861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81039,"sim:weight":0.226485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664246,"sim:weight":0.225796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91309,"sim:weight":0.222897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43408,"sim:weight":0.217074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.215138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88253,"sim:weight":0.20735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98472,"sim:weight":0.206309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91320,"sim:weight":0.20287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this innovative collection, leading international thinkers explore the notion that one explanation for the current malaise of the “politics of ecology” is that we increasingly find ourselves negotiating “technonatural” space/times. International contributors map the political ecologies of our technonatural present and indicate possible paths for technonatural futures. \n\nThe term “technonatures” is in debt to a long line of environmental cultural theory from Raymond Williams onwards, problematizing the idea that a politics of the environment can be usefully grounded in terms of the rhetoric of defending the pure, the authentic, or an idealized past solely in terms of the ecological or the natural. In using the term “technonatures” as an organizing myth and metaphor for thinking about the politics of nature in contemporary times, this collection seeks to explore one increasingly pronounced dimension of the social natures discussion. Technonatures highlights a growing range of voices considering the claim that we are not only inhabiting diverse social natures but that within such natures our knowledge of our worlds is ever more technologically mediated, produced, enacted, and contested.","bibo:AuthorList":["White, Damian F.","Wilbert, Chris"],"dc:date":"2011-06-16T08:10:42Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":312020,"sim:weight":0.283611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.281998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.262679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17180,"sim:weight":0.258037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.257709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65362,"sim:weight":0.255839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":264524,"sim:weight":0.248149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44614,"sim:weight":0.247624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101381,"sim:weight":0.237206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.23236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.225831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44768,"sim:weight":0.224636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44499,"sim:weight":0.223427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2880,"sim:weight":0.220542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56246,"sim:weight":0.219768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98879,"sim:weight":0.218911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99153,"sim:weight":0.215501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.210571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101412,"sim:weight":0.202484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.201135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As such, tourist London can be thought of as a massive conduit of flows of riotous forms and we might follow the geographer David Gilbert in seeing that: ‘tourism has played an under-recognized role in the\nshaping of the modern city as a place to be seen and experienced’. Here we consider one aspect of tourism, namely, how the increasingly popular guided walking tours in and around London are shaping and perform the city in ways that are perhaps less physical, more mobile and transient than many other tourist-based developments, though ones that are no less material and certainly not without effects. London may also be characterised as a multifunctional tourist-historic city, where tourism and leisure overlay and overlap with the commercial city and the historic centre. As such, London also has many spaces that are connected through acts of violence of the past made present in the now. Indeed, it can be argued that London, like other cities\n- but in perhaps more concentrated ways – has its own spectro-geographies, being populated by ghosts, the murdered, their perpetrators and so on. It also appears increasingly the case that publics convene around some of these sites of violence or representations of violence and disaster in themed historical museums, guided walks, or other sites, as tourists. Various terms have been developed to describe this convening or the places of trauma where convening occurs. We have heard of dark tourism, tragic tourism, thanatourism, fatal attractions and traumascapes. Yet, all these terms seem to imply that these spaces of trauma, violence and death are the opposite of everyday spaces, that their attraction may lie in their being exceptional spaces far removed from the everyday. However, this may not quite be the case.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hansen, Rikke","Wilbert, Chris"],"dc:date":"2011-08-11T11:54:24Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1344737,"sim:weight":0.495972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101270,"sim:weight":0.477321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.461771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.452651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108321,"sim:weight":0.432511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108754,"sim:weight":0.429822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.413932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.403098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108957,"sim:weight":0.381791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931333,"sim:weight":0.352321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387059,"sim:weight":0.335766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66773,"sim:weight":0.317483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109222,"sim:weight":0.313546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46489,"sim:weight":0.303196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108497,"sim:weight":0.279038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999527,"sim:weight":0.273957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.268836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.26154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.255567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44614,"sim:weight":0.244173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although academic, government and mainstream professional interest in COSW has waned over the past decades in the UK, there are grounds to believe that this may change and that lessons can be learned from COSW in other countries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mantle, Greg","Backwith, Dave"],"dc:date":"2011-09-20T13:46:46Z","doi":"10.1093/bjsw","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":341025,"sim:weight":0.344057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93753,"sim:weight":0.343483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43045,"sim:weight":0.331865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633023,"sim:weight":0.321765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.317406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351922,"sim:weight":0.308873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.304699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.288671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.288338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43987,"sim:weight":0.271282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.263733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43845,"sim:weight":0.263672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.261797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106621,"sim:weight":0.256104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.254552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96219,"sim:weight":0.253365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46592,"sim:weight":0.251669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5629,"sim:weight":0.251594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.250898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103117,"sim:weight":0.245794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The measures we used are the separate percentage data for men and women on: smoking and employment and national income per capita (US$) and percentage growth per annum. \n\nResults: Regression analysis showed that women smokers were more frequent in countries with higher national income, but women were less likely to smoke in countries of rapid growth. Men were less likely to smoke in countries with higher national income, but more likely to smoke in countries of rapid growth. Two principle components together explained 62% of all the variance in the international data. The largest factor was positively correlated with the percentage of employed females, the percentage of female smokers and national income per capita, but negatively correlated with the percentage of male smokers and percentage annual growth. The effect of female employment was not continuous, but above a threshold of 51%, was associated with a higher prevalence of female smoking. The smaller, second factor was only weakly correlated with any smoking variables. \n\nConclusions: In his 1994 model (subsequently adopted by the WHO) Lopez looked at historical trends in `stages\u0027 of smoking prevalence. These have been associated with `stages\u0027 of economic development. We extended this analysis to look at a dynamic change (% annual growth) and a social indicator (employment). Male and female smoking is affected differentially by economic change and by level of income. These are also strongly related to the percentage of women in employment. This has implications for workplace policies on smoking.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stevens, Andy","Caan, Woody"],"dc:date":"2011-08-18T09:40:04Z","doi":"10.1177/1466424008089799","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Fagan, J Brook, E Rubenstone and C Zhang.

Using a comprehensive range of examples, which include feral cats and wild wolves, to domestic animals and intensively farmed cattle, the contributors explore the complex relations in which humans and non-human animals are mixed together. Our emotions involving animals range from those of love and compassion to untold cruelty, force, violence and power. As humans we have placed different animals into different categories, according to some notion of species, usefulness, domesticity or wildness. As a result of these varying and often contested orderings, animals are assigned to particular places and spaces. Animal Spaces, Beastly Places shows us that there are many exceptions and variations on the spatiality of human-animal spatial orderings, within and across cultures, and over time. It develops new ways of thinking about human animal interactions and encourages us to find better ways for humans and animals to live together.","bibo:AuthorList":["Philo, Chris","Wilbert, Chris"],"dc:date":"2011-06-16T08:43:08Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":641844,"sim:weight":0.409989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351207,"sim:weight":0.399302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":504125,"sim:weight":0.379708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26013,"sim:weight":0.245387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26012,"sim:weight":0.245387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13236,"sim:weight":0.208301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50382,"sim:weight":0.190993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98786,"sim:weight":0.188618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.169262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103118,"sim:weight":0.164435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.156103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99341,"sim:weight":0.155786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2880,"sim:weight":0.147307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.144303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":264524,"sim:weight":0.137673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.132917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710045,"sim:weight":0.131262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.129779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.126052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.124923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aid, pledged by donors for development and reconstruction in Sri Lanka, was conditional upon the successful continuation of progress towards a permanent solution to the ethnic conflict. The Prime Minister promised ‘a provisional administrative structure with wider powers to the LTTE’, suggesting that the Tokyo aid would enable the implementation of a new framework to re-energise Sri Lankan peace and development. However, the aid package has elicited mixed reactions from key players. In particular, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are refusing to participate in further peace negotiations until there is a more equitable distribution of resources, resulting in more aid being allocated to the areas of need in the North, East and South. That is, those areas where they wish to have greater control, and they have condemned the proposed new administrative structure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hood, Penelope J."],"dc:date":"2011-06-16T13:42:58Z","doi":"10.1016/S1572-8323","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6033,"sim:weight":0.466016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43598,"sim:weight":0.459732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6053,"sim:weight":0.440245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":215456,"sim:weight":0.4021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631151,"sim:weight":0.373337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60158,"sim:weight":0.281308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710005,"sim:weight":0.261581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661781,"sim:weight":0.250616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17011,"sim:weight":0.239178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710216,"sim:weight":0.236632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5539,"sim:weight":0.232156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5543,"sim:weight":0.223931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.223276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4007,"sim:weight":0.215245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6060,"sim:weight":0.210749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46592,"sim:weight":0.199799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48390,"sim:weight":0.19655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664548,"sim:weight":0.192593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93450,"sim:weight":0.190321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381915,"sim:weight":0.176335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The relationship between culture and chronicity is explained with reference to working styles. It deals with the notion of time and time span with regard to new technologies, and how these may impact on concentration, face-to-face communication and styles of learning. It discusses the importance of effective systems and task management, along with decision making. Finally, the paper addresses time issues pertaining to e-mail. \n\nFindings: The paper finds that the nature of information has changed from face-to-face to staring at computer screens. Research shows that over one-quarter of recipients of e-mails misunderstood the communication, even where those interacting are close colleagues, while research at three US business schools found that colleagues were more likely to be dishonest with one another when using e-mail because of the lack of face-to-face interaction. Studies have also shown that business teams co-operate less if they have not talked face-to-face.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Lyndon","Hood, Penelope J."],"dc:date":"2011-06-16T14:18:07Z","doi":"10.1108/00197851011080603","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664531,"sim:weight":0.286391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.282718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.276872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.274969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.27251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99444,"sim:weight":0.267095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.259425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Following this, almost 4,000 articles from 23 journals are assessed on the basis of their philosophical underpinnings and contribution to knowledge. Findings are reported and implications are discussed. \n\nFindings: Most strategy research, especially in higher ranked journals, comes from a positivist perspective. Across all journals, most contributions to knowledge are in the form of stretching theory. There is a limited amount of reflective work in the strategy literature. \n\nPractical implications: Given the form and content of strategy research, it is increasingly unlikely that research will make the crossover from the academic to the practitioner world. \n\nOriginality/value: This paper provides a better understanding of the process through which academic management research can be carried out and the barriers to this process.

The\npaper discusses how perceptions of taxation and the acceptability of tax changes are integral to tax policy\nformulation. It shows that changes in tax regulations and their implementation gives rise to two distinct\noutcomes. One in which government policy formulation, at least at the moral and practical level of policy\nformulation, is seen to be equitable fair and acceptable. This is because the proposed tax changes have\nan adequate cushion to mitigate what is perceived as the excess burden on individual and families at the\nmargins of the society; the other in which tax revenue increases are conditional on the level of ‘avoidance’\nand ‘evasion’. The paper examines the potential effects on the behaviour of citizens of an increased burden\nof tax on the one hand, and on the other, its impact on the increase in tax revenue. It transpired that the\neffect of tax changes depends critically on the economic cycle, time lags in implementing tax changes,\nconfidence of people in politicians to adapt a balance approach that is equitable and fair in that it is seen\nas progressive rather than regressive in its effect. The research findings, while exploratory, have interesting\nimplications for policy formulation and suggest further research is required to study the adjustment in\ntaxpayer behaviour resulting from policy changes and the processes which bring together perceptions\nand reality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Webb, John","Hussain, Javed G."],"dc:date":"2011-06-16T14:57:53Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48417,"sim:weight":0.6253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":952736,"sim:weight":0.594182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48369,"sim:weight":0.578631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":92984,"sim:weight":0.556724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1390609,"sim:weight":0.491676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47305,"sim:weight":0.461904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45338,"sim:weight":0.405198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44928,"sim:weight":0.391616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44875,"sim:weight":0.373672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98916,"sim:weight":0.371953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220830,"sim:weight":0.328332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26147,"sim:weight":0.307995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95780,"sim:weight":0.297099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93468,"sim:weight":0.296275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352138,"sim:weight":0.287837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":823348,"sim:weight":0.244753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46864,"sim:weight":0.241965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.239101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.23632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47362,"sim:weight":0.22934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Phase 1 focused on how the carers developed effective processes to facilitate the individuals in the group to represent not only their experiences but those of the collective. I describe how a critical incident facilitated this discussion and how the carers used the action research cycle to enable this change. Phase 2 enabled the group to reflect on their experiences of the group\u0027s impact upon them. The carers identified the following main themes of their experience of the group: shared experience of mental health stigma; empowerment and increased confidence; increased knowledge to enable them to care for themselves and their loved one more effectively, although this was tinged with a sense of frustration. In this process, I reflect on the vision that I had for Carers Against Stigma (CAS) as a user researcher and practitioner working with carers. I discuss the potential conflict that I faced as a practitioner and researcher initiating a carer-led group.

The position of language skills in this area of literature and policy is problematic and a new paradigm is proposed. \n\nDesign/methodology/approach: This paper considers findings from an empirical project using both quantitative and qualitative methods, first, a 1,200 company telephone survey and second, an 80 company batch of face-to-face interviews. \n\nFindings: Strong international orientation seems indeed to be a determinant of success in international trade. The decision-makers of the successful companies were notably more likely to have foreign language skills than those in the other groups and were also the only group to include self-reported skills at the highest level. However, comparison of the countries in which the firms were dealing with the languages in which decision-makers claimed skills shows very clearly that the decision-makers of the “successful” international companies were often not using their foreign language skills in business. In addition, these decision-makers also possessed better attitudes towards foreign experience and other elements of international orientation. \n\nPractical implications: The paper discusses the implications of the findings for policy-makers responsible for training and trainers themselves. The evidence supports the view that government subsidies focusing on language training might be better directed at a more varied range of activities to develop international orientation. \n\nOriginality/value: The article contributes to the development of qualitative research in this area in examining the foreign language use of decision-makers in successful international SMEs and locating this within their broader international orientation. It posits that language skills make an indirect contribution to overall international business success which is more valuable than their direct contribution to improved communication with specific foreign clients and markets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Knowles, Deborah","Mughan, Terry","Lloyd-Reason, Lester"],"dc:date":"2011-06-16T09:27:18Z","doi":"10.1108/14626000610705787","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":16273,"sim:weight":0.302626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99399,"sim:weight":0.302104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145659,"sim:weight":0.300161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383594,"sim:weight":0.267303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386651,"sim:weight":0.256035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664532,"sim:weight":0.243794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387372,"sim:weight":0.241357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43912,"sim:weight":0.236856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.236337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Qualitative research was chosen to create a holistic picture of the possible impact of relational factors on IJV performance. \n\nFindings: Trust appears to be the most important of the relational factors on IJV performance, followed by commitment, cooperation and satisfaction. Chinese cultural values, such as guanxi, also need to be taken into account as an important factor of IJV relationships. \n\nResearch limitations/implications: When researching inter-firm relationships, ideally data would be gathered from both parties. This was not possible owing to difficulties encountered in gaining access to the Chinese parent organisations. Nevertheless, the findings are of interest to British firms interested in the Chinese market. \n\nPractical implications: Joint ventures in China continue to experience high failure rates. Failure to nurture relationships with joint venture partners is one reason for failure. Despite the limitations noted above, the findings make a useful contribution to the management literature on China. \n\nOriginality/value: Whereas many researchers have studied financial and non-financial measures of joint venture performance, little has been written on relational factors and performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, Jonathan S.","Brennan, Ross"],"dc:date":"2011-06-16T14:05:55Z","doi":"10.1108/09555340910940150","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43901,"sim:weight":0.446066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58528,"sim:weight":0.314717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664531,"sim:weight":0.313035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43839,"sim:weight":0.301916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99399,"sim:weight":0.240414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":603876,"sim:weight":0.229167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.228573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98718,"sim:weight":0.226798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90187,"sim:weight":0.224085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48237,"sim:weight":0.211579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45037,"sim:weight":0.206605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387372,"sim:weight":0.206106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383420,"sim:weight":0.205559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387323,"sim:weight":0.201324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.197971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.197332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.197332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.197332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.197332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.197332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, to what extent is it important in relation to UK-Chinese joint venture relationships? Although many British companies choose the IJV option for entering China, joint ventures often result in conflict and possible dissolution. We argue that one of the key factors in IJV success or failure is the degree of understanding of guanxi on the part of the UK partner. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide a better understanding of guanxi and its relative importance in UK-Chinese joint venture relationships. The results from 25 interviews with managers involved in UK/Chinese joint ventures are discussed in the paper. Our research findings indicate that those companies that succeeded in China generally have a firm understanding of guanxi. This is largely because the majority of managers involved are Chinese. Many believe that guanxi and the understanding of guanxi is an important factor in successful UK-Chinese IJV relationships. We evaluate the argument that the significance of guanxi is already in decline, or will shortly be in decline, as a result of economic and legal reforms in China.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brennan, Ross","Wilson, Jonathan S."],"dc:date":"2011-09-22T11:52:41Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N R Abramson and J X Ai.

A joint\nventure parent company needs to understand how to interact with their partner, in order to prevent possible conflict. China’s recent entry into the World Trade Organisation,\nunderlines the importance of understanding the influence relational factors have on\nperformance. Twenty-five parent companies have been investigated for the purpose of\nthis study. The influence of relational factors is analysed alongside other important\nvariables investigated in previous studies into IJV performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, Jonathan S.","Brennan, Ross"],"dc:date":"2011-06-20T09:47:48Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Aiello.

A vast array of statistical data is usually assembled by national governments to demonstrate a closing or widening of productivity or trade ‘gaps’ with other countries or groups of countries. The authors of this book argue that far too little attention has been paid to the often subtle, but highly significant, organisational and cultural characteristics which underpin production and trade in a globalised economy. \n\nDimensions of Competitiveness suggests that awareness of the impacts of this neglected dimension of competitiveness can, together with appropriate corrective action, significantly improve corporate and national performance.\n\nWhile considering a variety of more conventional dimensions of international competitiveness, the authors challenge many established tenets. A number of policy prescriptions are outlined as a result. Attention is also paid to some of the key distributive and infrastructural roles in enhancing international competitiveness including facilitating labour and capital mobility and providing efficient transport systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lloyd-Reason, Lester","Wall, Stuart"],"dc:date":"2011-08-11T12:03:16Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83708,"sim:weight":0.301714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9847,"sim:weight":0.275225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.199877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631458,"sim:weight":0.187679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.186754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352138,"sim:weight":0.17864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90435,"sim:weight":0.176916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.174311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55754,"sim:weight":0.173251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352124,"sim:weight":0.17114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.170196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57174,"sim:weight":0.167579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.167128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.167128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.167128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.167128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.167128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.167128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.167128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.167128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":114404,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Mixed-species flocks: an example of niche construction?","bibo:abstract":"Mixed-species flocks result from co-evolved relationships between participants: inter-specific gregariousness that varies in strength in different species pairs or groups. Such inter-specific associations of birds are a characteristic of most avian communities, observed in diverse habitats from forests to grasslands, estuaries to the open ocean, worldwide in both high latitudes and in the tropics. We explore the consequences of mixed-species flocks in shaping the selective environment and discuss whether the participants in flocks should be identified as niche constructors. As a result of the decision to associate with other species, a bird alters its relationship with competitors; potentially gains access to resources; becomes safer from predators; and may change microhabitat use. The recurrent patterns in the behaviour of disparate unrelated species active in mixed-species flocks have led investigators to conclude that similar selective pressures have shaped their behaviour. However mixed-species flocks are variable in their characteristics, the birds active in them are diverse in form and behaviour, and the selective pressures that have shaped their propensity to join mixed-species flocks must be various. In forming mixed-species flocks, species with specialised roles at the centre of flocks are creating a complex social environment that represents an important biotic selective force shaping their own ecology and behaviour, and that of other species within the avian community. In this review we consider how the spectrum of inter-specific relationships in mixed-species flocks make them an interesting focus for further studies of niche construction by relocation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harrison, Nancy M.","Whitehouse, Michael J."],"dc:date":"2011-09-20T09:42:24Z","doi":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.01.013","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R W Byrne.

The Black-backed Puffback was identified as the\nnuclear species in flocks due to their abundance and frequency with which they were\nfollowed by other species. Mixed-species flocks represent another niche dimension in\nthis diverse bird community, but few of these species could be described as flock\nspecialists; most of the birds observed in mixed-species flocks in this study were\nopportunistic attendant species, including the African Pygmy Kingfisher Ispidina\npicta, not previously described as joining mixed-species flocks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gordon, Alasdair I.V.","Harrison, Nancy M."],"dc:date":"2011-06-20T14:57:40Z","doi":"10.2989/00306525.2010.519514","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Berner TO and Grubb TC Jr. (1985).

{"identifier":114410,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Building the international SME: a global policy response","bibo:abstract":"The past twenty years has seen growing academic and policy interest in the role of SMEs within a global context. There has been much debate surrounding the negative impact of globalisation on the international SME arising from increased competitive pressures. However, SMEs have long found opportunities in the global economy and as international trade has expanded so too have these opportunities.\n      The numerous benefits to SMEs engaged in international trade are well documented, with a considerable body of evidence that international trading activity stimulates increased productivity growth by strengthening competition and innovation and increasing access to new ideas and technology. International trading activity enables businesses to achieve growth and economies of scale which domestic markets alone would not provide. Exporters are consistently found to out-perform non-exporters using a variety of measures of success, including profitability, production, wages and sales volumes.\n      Despite these advantages, the SME share in the total value of international trade is often found to be markedly lower that their share in GDP, evidence of the barriers facing the SME seeking to access international markets. Accordingly the international SME has attracted the attention of policy makers, as any barriers to international trade are likely to impinge disproportionately on this group of firms which are often the most productive, R \u0026 D intensive and most growth orientated, and thus potentially the strongest contributors to a dynamic national economy.\n      This paper is based on a study undertaken by the OECD/APEC to gain a better understanding of the barriers to internationalising (defined as all those constraints that hinder the firm\u0027s ability to initiate, to develop, or to sustain business operations in overseas markets) faced by SMEs, and to share knowledge of government interventions to reduce those barriers.\n      In general, there seems to be a close match between the perceived barriers as reported by Member Economies and those that are perceived by SMEs. For the most part, support measures are appropriate to the key barriers reported by the international SME. Some mismatches do appear however. There appears to be something of a policy gap with regard to external barriers falling within the \u0027business environment\u0027 dimension. Here, governments appear to underestimate the barriers facing the SME as they attempt to access international markets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lloyd-Reason, Lester","Mughan, Terry"],"dc:date":"2011-07-28T13:37:44Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":114423,"sim:weight":0.687857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91147,"sim:weight":0.399686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387323,"sim:weight":0.34124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664532,"sim:weight":0.314799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383594,"sim:weight":0.29097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103055,"sim:weight":0.280643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145659,"sim:weight":0.2709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9845,"sim:weight":0.267634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99151,"sim:weight":0.265041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381902,"sim:weight":0.258215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.253504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.253504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.253504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.253504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.253504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.253504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.253504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.253504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.253504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.253504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A qualitative research methodology was employed and the findings provide evidence relating to three important areas: firstly, the types of business support programmes available to retailers seeking to internationalise from the UK, secondly, the barriers encountered by retail companies expanding overseas, and thirdly, how government and private organisations can assist in helping retailers overcome these hurdles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hutchinson, Karise","Fleck, Emma","Lloyd-Reason, Lester"],"dc:date":"2011-07-28T13:47:14Z","doi":"10.1080/09593960903331378","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23097,"sim:weight":0.39737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1117655,"sim:weight":0.376181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99169,"sim:weight":0.346394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106890,"sim:weight":0.344243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44207,"sim:weight":0.284942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101336,"sim:weight":0.274043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9845,"sim:weight":0.265314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383594,"sim:weight":0.260845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16185,"sim:weight":0.239319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43873,"sim:weight":0.229904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1636197,"sim:weight":0.225804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539967,"sim:weight":0.22403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43497,"sim:weight":0.219455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.218399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.218399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.218399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.218399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.218399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.218399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.218399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In it, we explore the extent to which inquests offer the opportunity to increase our understanding of the situation of older people who are “found dead.” This is a kind of death that might be categorized as a “bad death” and, as such, one that will involve the coroner. Research that has been conducted on older people who have been found dead indicates that coroners’ records are an inadequate source of information. We argue that this is because the system of death certification in England and Wales is focused on the medical cause of death. In consequence, the social circumstances surrounding those who are found dead remain unrecorded. We cannot judge therefore the extent or seriousness of this category of “bad deaths” nor whether social intervention in such cases might have been warranted. We further argue that proposals for reform, which were motivated in large part by the desire to improve the chances of detecting cases of concealed homicide as revealed by the Shipman Inquiry, have missed an opportunity to reconceptualize and broaden the role of the coroner in a way that would increase our knowledge and understanding of the circumstances surrounding other “bad deaths.”","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, John","Johnson, Julia"],"dc:date":"2011-08-11T14:04:17Z","doi":"10.1080/13576270802383774","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43959,"sim:weight":0.282757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43729,"sim:weight":0.261934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3447,"sim:weight":0.255147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101327,"sim:weight":0.217492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.212271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2905,"sim:weight":0.209073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18196,"sim:weight":0.208419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653231,"sim:weight":0.203074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336346,"sim:weight":0.201529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.198155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43317,"sim:weight":0.196484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101412,"sim:weight":0.191287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98725,"sim:weight":0.184015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.182001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102723,"sim:weight":0.177759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43714,"sim:weight":0.17408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99216,"sim:weight":0.172466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.172315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43408,"sim:weight":0.16806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.164553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Whilst the College of Radiographers have emphasised the importance of imaging personnel embracing this research ethos, there is little available data on the level of research activity within sonographic practice or on the factors that influence a sonographer\u0027s involvement in research activities. This work attempts to address these deficiencies. A questionnaire was sent to 300 UK-based sonographers of whom 218 responded (72%). The questionnaire was specifically designed to establish the level of involvement in research, the utilisation of research findings, attitudes towards research and perceived barriers to active research involvement. Responses were analysed investigating any correlations with the population demographics. The data collected showed the majority of sonographers (89%) were enthusiastic about research but with only 33% and 60% currently or previously performing research, respectively, and 73% using research findings to modify their clinical practice. Certain barriers to an active research involvement were shown, with 63%, 55% and 40% citing lack of time, education and collegial support, respectively. A range of statistical findings were linked to particular sonographer groups. The importance of good organisational structures and effective support from fellow health professionals was highlighted. The results confirm sonographers\u0027 appreciation of the benefits of research and it is suggested that if this enthusiasm is translated into effective research strategies, research output from ultrasound and other clinical departments should be enhanced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Elliott, Vicki","Svensson, Jon","Wilson, Stephanie E.","Brennan, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2011-10-20T09:06:20Z","doi":"10.1016/j.radi.2008.06.003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.272778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.25744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55530,"sim:weight":0.25233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656477,"sim:weight":0.241232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104462,"sim:weight":0.227755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44175,"sim:weight":0.223665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.216324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This research, they argue, may merely serve to increase our lack of understanding in this area, and often results in myths and misconceptions upon which SME policies and support programmes have been developed and introduced. They go on to suggest that academic models are often poorly suited to the problems faced by SMEs within the international trading environment. In many instances, the contributors find SMEs at the vanguard of the challenge to accepted business practices: it is these challenges that underpin the text.\n\nIllustrating that today’s SMEs are faced with the critical issue of how to create and maintain a sustainable competitive advantage in light of the increased complexity of international trade and global business linkages, this Handbook will prove invaluable to both academics and practitioners involved in business and management and entrepreneurship.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lloyd-Reason, Lester","Sear, Leigh"],"dc:date":"2011-09-20T09:23:48Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91147,"sim:weight":0.471083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664532,"sim:weight":0.397418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58828,"sim:weight":0.342018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103055,"sim:weight":0.31047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45128,"sim:weight":0.270909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.246901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.241773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Buddhist economics differs significantly from mainstream (neoclassical) economics in its ontological underpinning. This means that assumptions about human nature are different: the core values of mainstream economics are self-interest and competition in the pursuit of maximum welfare or utility, while in Buddhist economics, ‘self’ includes oneself, society and nature, which are all simultaneously interconnected. The core values are compassion and cooperation through which well-being is achieved leading to higher wisdom (pañña). Employee volunteer programmes (EVPs) are regarded as one example of corporate citizenship activities. This paper explores the consequences of introducing EVPs using a Buddhist economic framework in three different companies in Thailand. When a Buddhist economic approach is adopted by EVPs, the programme can be embedded into business practices including human resource development and the organisational development process, which may lead to the cultivation of pañña. This may be of value to organisations in the West.","bibo:AuthorList":["Prayukvong, Wanna","Rees, Bronwen A."],"dc:date":"2011-08-18T09:19:43Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103690,"sim:weight":0.264728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145887,"sim:weight":0.19925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664548,"sim:weight":0.194006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664727,"sim:weight":0.187789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.183855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.178565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.170575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":114428,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Conference Paper"],"bibo:shortTitle":"From fragmentation to ontologically reflexive pluralism","bibo:abstract":"States that pluralism is a problem that is confronted by both insiders and outsiders when they enquire into the nature of economics: the fact that there are many diverse organising principles about one\nand the same phenomenon. Pluralism both relativizes differences and magnifies the\ndecision-problem. As a consequence, the merits or otherwise of pluralism are quickly\nbrought into focus. This paper aims to examine whether the pluralist treatment of different issues in economics is a good or bad development. More specifically the paper seeks to explore how economics can arrive at a position where pluralism fosters a form of\nconceptual and methodological openness that is critically tolerant i.e. one where alternative ideas are not dismissed out of hand but at the same time have to stand up to an accepted framework of critical analysis in order to gain acceptance within the cannon of economic analysis. Opposition to the pluralist project in part stems from a misunderstanding of the nature of pluralism: pluralism does not advance the acceptance of all theoretical and\nmethodological frameworks concerning certain issues/phenomena in economics (i.e.\nrelativism). Pluralism in the context of a Kuhnian incommensurability of paradigms is thus to be rejected. A pluralist approach can be beneficial as long as different strands of thought are connected. The key to making pluralism work is the actual exchange of ideas and not a plurality without conversations. This is akin to Mill’s espousal of free speech as a mechanisme of subjecten ideas to criticism. Habermas has argued that diverse theoretical and empirical approaches are needed to support informed social criticism. Thus it is\nimportant to remember that social sciences can still produce truth in their own mutually\nexclusive discourses. We contend that it is not possible to advance a concept of pluralism that is based on tolerance and respect of other perspectives but which is devoid of criticism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Negru, Ioana"],"dc:date":"2011-08-18T08:44:17Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":79025,"sim:weight":0.486048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44460,"sim:weight":0.272465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103044,"sim:weight":0.238306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.228253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.224536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44865,"sim:weight":0.221166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46580,"sim:weight":0.214541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43653,"sim:weight":0.209715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145179,"sim:weight":0.209368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.206576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.205968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710115,"sim:weight":0.201867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.198048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81239,"sim:weight":0.196317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710204,"sim:weight":0.193099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18068,"sim:weight":0.192865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352224,"sim:weight":0.192799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.190404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43534,"sim:weight":0.189382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103052,"sim:weight":0.186675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Written principally from an academic perspective, this paper outlines the background to the development of community forests, a rationale for the research project, and the conceptual design of the multimedia system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spaul, Martin W.J.","Evans, Simon H.","Unsworth, Stanley A."],"dc:date":"2011-08-11T13:54:48Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103736,"sim:weight":0.311239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710191,"sim:weight":0.278024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9340185,"sim:weight":0.24609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.237278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145543,"sim:weight":0.233419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.229738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.214444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The principal concern is not with the sustainability of any particular landscape used as a tourist resource, but rather with the role that suitably interpreted landscapes can play in the general establishment of a sustainable relationship with nature by increasing environmental awareness and building motivations for policy and lifestyle changes. Although these general sustainability issues provide the main focus of this paper, they are discussed through the vehicle of a particular set of landscapes and their interpretation: ancient woodlands constituted as leisure and tourism venues. The perspective from which this paper is written is that of the designer of interpretative materials; in particular, materials delivered via the ‘new media’ – web sites, computer-based kiosks, etc – with their characteristics of high information volume, small physical footprint and high engagement. However, since realising the potential of such communication strategies is not a matter of the blind accumulation of computer-based materials, this paper is concerned solely with the cultural milieu of, and the strategic environmental context of, the interpretation of historic landscapes for tourists – squarely with the ‘what’ rather than the ‘how’ of communication.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spaul, Martin W.J.","Evans, Simon H."],"dc:date":"2011-08-18T08:40:58Z","doi":"10.1080/13683500508668216","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664587,"sim:weight":0.282322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664638,"sim:weight":0.279701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101516,"sim:weight":0.266823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386835,"sim:weight":0.265155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931333,"sim:weight":0.260705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.254944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709918,"sim:weight":0.250079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652783,"sim:weight":0.243844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.240541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664716,"sim:weight":0.23323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.230404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.230404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.230404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.230404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.230404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.230404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.230404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.230404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.230404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.230404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":114447,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The re-thinking of university education","bibo:abstract":"The last two decades have pushed creativity and individual genius to the margins whereby children who display an enquiring mind that goes beyond the boundaries of the national curriculum and learning outcomes are regarded as “troublemakers” who do not fit in. We have stifled and failed those who are in need of intellectual challenges that go beyond the “course text book” by systemising and “procedurising” education in production like packages. The education system has “unlearned” society how to think critically by the continuous quest for examination success and certified status. We have reached the stage where education itself has become “uncritical” and has alienated teachers, lecturers, administrators and researchers from the true quest of its endeavours – that of free thought and expression, innovation, tolerance, equity, justice, integrity, rigour and transparency. \nThis “uncritical” stance I argue has beset business education since the 1960’s, when its focus has been primarily on outputs not suited to the needs of those of who they purport to serve, a point eloquently made by C Wright Mills in his seminal publication “The Sociological Imagination”. The criticism that business management lacks relevance to real world problems is not founded solely by my personal perceptions but upon some fundamental themes that have been propounded in the name of “academic utility” that pervades business education and qualifications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Armitage, Andrew M.D."],"dc:date":"2011-08-10T15:05:47Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Armitage.

{"identifier":114448,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"From sentimentalism towards a critical HRD pedagogy","bibo:abstract":"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach for the teaching and delivery of HRD practices, professional skills and theory that challenges the modernist orthodoxy of contemporary organisational life and the requirements of professional bodies. Design/methodology/approach: First, the territory of a critical HRD pedagogy is defined within practices that respect human freedom and individual dignity as opposed to instrumentalism and target setting. Second, it will advocate an approach for a HRD pedagogy that has its roots within the lost paradigm of sentimentalism that emphasises the belief in the goodness of humanity informing the romantic notions of human imagination, creativity and respect for the individual that is realised through the dialogical process. Findings: The findings, evinced by vignettes, advocate a critical HRD pedagogy and the development of professional skills that base their values and ethics within emancipatory practices if organisations are to create and support sustainable learning environments rather than those located within the conventional wisdom of modernist orthodoxy. Practical applications: This paper calls for a critical HRD pedagogy and learning environments where individuals are engaged in the transformation of their socio-historical-political worlds and advocates dialogue is central to classroom practice if it is to realise the potential and creative impulses of individuals. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the critical HRD discourse in the development of knowledge, skills, values and professional practice by addressing the constraints of classroom practice in its response to the demands and tensions of professional bodies. It explicitly develops a critical HRD pedagogy that has implications for the assessment of HRD programmes and of their resourcing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Armitage, Andrew M.D."],"dc:date":"2011-09-20T10:46:26Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382960,"sim:weight":0.612449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.20794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.196335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18068,"sim:weight":0.193185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.191326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.190458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.178918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.178541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46522,"sim:weight":0.17793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386857,"sim:weight":0.176132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.175951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.175258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.175108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.173065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.173065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.173065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.173065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.173065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.173065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.173065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Human Capital models have largely resulted in short-term capitalistic restructuring and low cost savings within organisations, which are not sustainable within the long term. To achieve competitive advantage, it is accepted that organisations should aspire in the long term to high performance working. High performance working has been defined in terms ‘of the collective use of certain work organisation and human resource practices. Globalisation models have relied upon the management of human resources by locating the lowest cost model for delivery of services. This paper contends from research with HR professionals and managers, however, that the translation of high performance working still relies upon the psychological contract with workers. This work presents that this represents the locating of the lowest cost delivery for services or products represents solely a short-term model, which is not culturally sustainable. The consideration for the wellbeing of the workforce is not only paramount but will facilitate greater innovation and sustainability of competitive advantage, which will outweigh any short-term cost advantages.","bibo:AuthorList":["Keeble-Ramsay, Diane","Armitage, Andrew M.D."],"dc:date":"2011-09-20T11:39:36Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664727,"sim:weight":0.272142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352225,"sim:weight":0.247436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.245932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43887,"sim:weight":0.240112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929843,"sim:weight":0.236855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90435,"sim:weight":0.236405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.234956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study, which adopted the psychological contract as its guiding conceptual framework, therefore set out to investigate the roles and expectations of supervisors in their supervision and management of dissertations on taught part-time master’s programmes in order to add to the dearth of professional knowledge and praxis in this area of academic life. Thus the origin for this research was the need to generate new knowledge concerning the praxis of supervisors who supervise master’s degree dissertations in the Ashcroft International Business School at Anglia Polytechnic University within the area of Continual Professional Development (CPD). As such this study sets out to gain insights and generate new knowledge into the strategies and approaches that supervisors use to deal with a diverse range of students and subject specialisms.\n\nThe literature and previous studies regarding this issue is limited with the exception of Harrow and Loewenthal, Hetrick and Trafford, Bennett and Mansell and Woodhouse and it is anticipated that the findings that emerged from this study will be useful to both dissertation supervisors, and others within the higher education sector who are engaged in the facilitation of one-to-one counselling scenarios during the educational process. It envisaged that the findings will also serve as the means to inform policy, practitioner-based knowledge and practice in an under researched area of academic activity.\n\nAs such an insider practice-based ethnographic research methodology was used to study the praxis of fourteen master’s degree dissertation supervisors located in the Continuing Professional Development curriculum area of the Ashcroft International Business School at Anglia Polytechnic University. The fieldwork for this study consisted of semi-structured interviews and seven sets of case note evidence covering thirty eight supervisor-student dissertation meetings over a 3 year period.\n\nThe research evidence of the study indicates that supervisors work within subject and methodological silos when supervising their students. However the findings also show that supervisors give both academic and pastoral support to their students during the process of supervising dissertations. The findings revealed that the supervisory process can be conceptualised as a three stage process and that three types of student can also be identified that shows the different approaches they adopt when undertaking the dissertation stage of their postgraduate studies.\n\nThe conclusions of the study advocate the need for supervisors to exchange ideas and best practice more readily regarding their professional praxis of the supervision process.

{"identifier":114453,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Undertaking a structured literature review or structuring a literature review: tales from the field","bibo:abstract":"The diversity of sources of literature within the management disciplines has resulted in a growing need for a systematic methodology to map the territory of its associated theories and models. As such, when scoping out a doctoral or policy based study the Structured Literature Review (SLR) can be considered as a means by which critical literature central to and underpinning the research can be rigorously and systematically mapped out. However, there is little guidance, or evidence, of this being the case when undertaking small scale projects for example undergraduate or masters degree dissertations. This paper reports four case studies using semi-structured interviews of masters degree students following management programmes who undertook a Structured Literature Review based dissertation and the issues and problems they had to encounter during their journey. The findings from the case studies suggest that the approach to SLRs, whilst suited to doctoral level and policy based research is not appropriate when dealing with undergraduate and masters dissertations and projects. The case study findings identified that these students conducting a SLR had to deal with a new set of conceptual, methodological and data collection problems relating to this ‘unorthodox’ approach to conducting a postgraduate research dissertation. The findings show that students had to confront new paradigms of enquiry that are not normally taught or found in ‘traditional’ research texts and research methods courses that are taught on degree programmes. However, the findings do reveal that students gained a greater depth and insight into the subject they were researching through a more rigorous and structured approach. The paper then presents alternative remedies by way of the Rapid Structured Literature Review (RSLR) research strategy which is argued as an appropriate approach in conducting small scale literature based research projects when used with undergraduate and masters degree students rather than the SLR, which is better suited for other types of research such as doctoral and policy based activities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Armitage, Andrew M.D.","Keeble-Allen, Diane"],"dc:date":"2011-09-20T09:50:00Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":451636,"sim:weight":0.413427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55554,"sim:weight":0.338551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160787,"sim:weight":0.330669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160783,"sim:weight":0.326363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155856,"sim:weight":0.323065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102655,"sim:weight":0.318852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16185,"sim:weight":0.312108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.306575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1559155,"sim:weight":0.30042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.299621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.299374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.297513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.296239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.296239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.296239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.296239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.296239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.296239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.296239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.296239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Historically, team work and job rotation, as well as supporting human resource practices, appear to have had little impact on increased job satisfaction. As a set of conceptual approaches High Performance Working (HPW) stems from strands of post-Fordist practices. Further, it is a theme that both the UK government and UK professional bodies, for example the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development are investing time in promoting as providing competitive advantage and facilitating the potential to increase productivity both for the nation, and organisations, within the UK. Yet despite these aspirations, and a number of organisations committing to the ideology of the High Performance Working Organisation (HPWO), there remains little consideration of the complexity of employer-worker relationships underpinning the potential or failure of adopting HPW. Whilst the HPW considers \u0027bundles of practices\u0027, which might include strategies for employee relations and HR practices bundles, it lacks details in terms of the underpinning features of employee relations within the wider economy. Moreover, it is the context of performance which remains critical since the value to organisations lies with looking at the chain of links that runs from management intentions through management practices and employee responses to organisational outcomes. This paper explores, through narratives from managers and HR practitioners, the employee relations within the organisation, which impact upon the likelihood of successful introduction of HPW. The experience of change within the employer-worker relationships within the United Kingdom (UK), post 2000 remains a focus. The research data was collected from a wider project, which has incorporated 300 managers and HR practitioner respondents from the UK, who have participated in surveys, focus groups and provided narratives. For the purpose of this paper, the narratives were taken as a follow up from respondents from wider research to provide interpretations. By the consideration of social psychological models, these are contrasted with thinking about the perceptions around the employer-employee participation required for HPW. As such, it argues that the narrative data insights into the interpretation of issues surrounding the organisation aspiring towards HPW, which might not be gained by quantitative methods or large scale survey. Given the complexity of the organisation, in viewing narratives by way of considering the assumptions and problems individual workers construct, it is possible to facilitate views and explanations of the potential impact for and upon the interpretation of HPW. The paper argues that any weaknesses within the portrayal of the experiences of implementing HPW have lain, historically, where research has been undertaken by largely quantitative survey. Further failure to address the opportunities for methodological triangulation to gain deeper insights from the utilisation of research tools has been a feature of HPW research to date. Yet the utilisation of narratives potentially incorporates deeper insights from the worker\u0027s perspective than might be gained otherwise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Armitage, Andrew M.D.","Keeble-Ramsay, Diane"],"dc:date":"2011-09-20T10:47:44Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664727,"sim:weight":0.361367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.2823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708259,"sim:weight":0.281741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101228,"sim:weight":0.255988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383317,"sim:weight":0.255976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43601,"sim:weight":0.2504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101370,"sim:weight":0.249026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.248651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Continuities and discontinuities from Daniel Defoe\u0027s literary work to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Cast Away","bibo:abstract":"Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe has been widely discussed as a key example of 18th century British and – in the wider sense – European colonial writing that confirms the supremacy of Western culture while stressing transcultural desires and fears. Of particular interest is the relationship between Crusoe and Friday, which has been highlighted as a ‘paradigmatic colonial encounter’ (Said 1991). However, in some of the more contemporary ‘Robinson stories’ that follow in the footsteps of Defoe’s novel, the traditional cultural encounter between the civilized Self and the primitive Other has been omitted, and Robert Zemeckis’s Hollywood movie Cast Away is a good example of this tendency. Focusing on Cast Away, this study explores 1) how far the omission of this encounter leads to a break with colonial dichotomies, and 2) which aspects of colonial discourse continue to be widely disseminated via Hollywood productions. By linking psychological research with postcolonial and transcultural theory, it amends current film analysis and interpretations of contemporary “robinsonades” (e.g. Ingram 2001, Weaver-Hightower 2007 and 2006) while critically interrogating popular perspectives on transculturality and globalization (such as Welsch 1999). In particular, the essay reveals that, despite the loss of the encounter, a revision of traditional individualism and a certain dose of filmic parody, the neo-colonial capitalist identity promoted in the movie remains very much in line with Defoe’s colonial paradigm.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rings, Guido"],"dc:date":"2011-12-01T14:28:25Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109759,"sim:weight":0.309357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710348,"sim:weight":0.21672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383590,"sim:weight":0.210557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.193422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.191949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313617,"sim:weight":0.187346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45754,"sim:weight":0.186165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.175373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56246,"sim:weight":0.174356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44743,"sim:weight":0.172986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.171185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.170103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.167355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.165243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.164307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46636,"sim:weight":0.163608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710015,"sim:weight":0.162946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46828,"sim:weight":0.156659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98480,"sim:weight":0.15615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.151555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Be it as a potential mirror of popular attitudes, ideas and preoccupations, or as regards the likely impact on common views and opinions on migration, research cannot afford to ignore the filmic portrayals. In this context, this article explores cultural self-representations by British-Indians in one popular example of British-Asian cinema: Chadha\u0027s Bend it like Beckham. Considering the contextual patterns of European migrant cinema, key questions are: 1) how does the film express cultural differences and to what extent does this follow traditional concepts of culture?; 2) how is the interconnectedness of cultures articulated and how does this relate to current notions of interculturality and transculturality? The paper shows how contemporary films by celebrated directors such as Gurinder Chadha, Damian O’Donnell, Hark Bohm and Philippe Faucon fall into the trap of traditional concepts of culture that break with the strong intercultural or transcultural perspectives voiced by the same directors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rings, Guido"],"dc:date":"2011-12-01T14:26:01Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48286,"sim:weight":0.330606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47198,"sim:weight":0.323299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":988244,"sim:weight":0.311138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.308573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99117,"sim:weight":0.295766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47288,"sim:weight":0.28989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":114121,"sim:weight":0.285849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.285502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709927,"sim:weight":0.27702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.275538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89116,"sim:weight":0.254311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98711,"sim:weight":0.246495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.241198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051961,"sim:weight":0.235419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43963,"sim:weight":0.230067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.227356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48370,"sim:weight":0.220415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48378,"sim:weight":0.220348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43018,"sim:weight":0.215804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446416,"sim:weight":0.214661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Hone, now best known for publications such as The Political House that Jack Built (1820) and The Queen’s Matrimonial Ladder (1820), pirated Southey’s works, released competing versions of his poems and opposed his politics. Southey called for the imprisonment of pressman of Hone’s kind and yet, toward the end of his life, used his influence to help Hone financially. The two men came closest to each other in the post-Waterloo years of depression, poverty and radicalism, when Southey feared revolution and called for writers expressing opinions similar to his own of the 1790s to be gagged, and when Hone parodied his poem praising the old and new king — A Vision of Judgement (1821).

{"identifier":114469,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Thesis"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Stress, appraised control, and salivary immunoglobulin A.","bibo:abstract":"Salivary IgA is the primary antibody of mucosal immunity. It has been suggested that chronic stress may lower levels of IgA and lead to an increased susceptibility to respiratory illness. It is also suggested that acute stress increases IgA during active coping (that involves mental effort or controllability, such as time-based mathematics or memory tests) and decreases it during passive coping tasks (with no mental effort required or uncontrollable, such as the passive viewing of disgust images). However, tasks often classed as stressors have produced consistent IgA effects in areas of passive coping and chronic stress. These inconsistencies might be a consequence of methodological issues, such as sampling procedures, or may reflect individual differences, for example how a task is appraised. This thesis examined appraisal effects with focus on control over a stressful event and a potential relationship with salivary IgA. Three different study designs were used to examine stress, appraised control and salivary IgA. To alter appraisal during passive coping, disgust images were presented as either real pictures or as fake effects from fictional films to change the participant\u0027s perception of control during the image presentations. The role of appraised control during a chronic stress situation was explored in caregivers, and finally, appraised control and subjective stress were investigated in relation to IgA daily for a week in undergraduates, alongside perceived stress and hassles from the prior month. Viewing disgusting images increased perceived stress, irrespective of whether the images were presented as real or fake. Crucially, control was lower and salivary IgA increased only in the group that were told the images were real. Appraised control over a chronic stressor of caregiving did not affect IgA, but neither did perceived stress. Finally, in undergraduates, stress measured at the same time as sampling showed a lower level of IgA on days rated the highest compared to lowest on stress, and appraised control had a negative correlation with IgA when averages were used over the week, but only in a sub-group of participants. Perceived stress or hassles from the prior month did not relate to IgA. The main conclusions are that a participant\u0027s appraisal of passive coping tasks can be altered and that this may lead to a change in their IgA response. The overall results challenge the view that IgA is a stress marker, as the only consistent effect of stress on IgA was its consistency. Yet inconsistent IgA responses are likely to be a recurring issue in research due to the sensitivity of IgA to a number of different methodological practices that may cause a direct effect, or may alter appraisals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farley, Carol J."],"dc:date":"2011-11-08T08:43:34Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S K Agarwal, Marshall Jnr and G D.

The approach aimed to enhance motor adaptation, engendering adaptation in psychosocial domains of quality of life. It employed a specially developed therapeutic treatment chair, in an unloading toward loading strategy, to regulate and control percentage of weight-bearing by manipulation of buoyancy (Archimedes principle). Participants were bilateral spastic hypertonia, Cerebral Palsy children, aged 10-15 years. Mixed-method methodology was used to investigate effectiveness of treatment, employing a small sample in a multiple case study. In conclusion, the developed approach enables aquatic therapy to be employed to improve motor function adaptation on land and consequently enhancing adaptation in other psychosocial domains - perceived competence, empowerment and motivation - thus improving quality of life for children with cerebral palsy, sustained at a one-year post-intervention test.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shelef, Arie Niv"],"dc:date":"2011-11-08T09:07:51Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14776,"sim:weight":0.441492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9024488,"sim:weight":0.389983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":691724,"sim:weight":0.313783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":894226,"sim:weight":0.265553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43982,"sim:weight":0.214438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43302,"sim:weight":0.169448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336200,"sim:weight":0.168388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337555,"sim:weight":0.161523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107200,"sim:weight":0.160091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46759,"sim:weight":0.154081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158974,"sim:weight":0.148448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101267,"sim:weight":0.141187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.139995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222953,"sim:weight":0.138465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.1382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.137198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.137015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.13534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387387,"sim:weight":0.133154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.132347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":114471,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Thesis"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The process of recovery for people diagnosed with personality disorder: a case study of The Haven.","bibo:abstract":"The study investigates the process of recovery for people diagnosed with personality disorder. This is related to the application of the new meaning of recovery from mental illness as explored by members of The Haven which, as the service setting for the study, addresses the problems of a client group that suffers significant social exclusion, known to impact on demand for health and other public services. It aims to examine efforts which attempt to reverse this social exclusion as an aspect of the recovery process. An earlier inquiry by the author yielded a new understanding of the diagnosis of personality disorder as defined by service users, and contributed to a change in the national agenda when the Department of Health responded by providing new national guidance and funding for pilot projects throughout the country. This resulted in The Haven, the service context for this current study. As yet, internationally, there is no agreed rationale of recovery for those diagnosed with personality disorder and few researchers have sought the views of service users regarding the issue. The following study is the first internationally known research about personality disorder and recovery. A Participatory Action Research approach was chosen for this study and The Haven Research Group, comprised of the author and Haven clients, formulated proposed research questions and conducted Focus Groups and Individual Client Interviews with 66 participants, over a period of three years. The group has been concerned with the effectiveness of The Haven as a recovery tool from the perspective of service users and carers. An examination of emerging themes, and the interplay between themes, gives insight into what participants consider to be the key steps to recovery for someone with a personality disorder diagnosis. From this thematic analysis a map is proposed of the journey of recovery for people with the diagnosis. Findings offer contributions to knowledge in terms of the service model and propose a new construct regarding recovery in personality disorder. This is defined as a journey of small steps highlighting recovering as a process, rather than recovery as a goal, leading to the emergence of the new concept of Transitional Recovery. As an alternative to the historically sequential path of rehabilitation and proposed recovery, this study offers a new, socially inclusive way of working with people who have a personality disorder diagnosis where they may choose to retain a haven while continuing to develop and progress on their chosen path in the wider world.","bibo:AuthorList":["Castillo, Heather"],"dc:date":"2011-11-08T09:01:30Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G Adshed and C Jacob.

To date there has been very little quantitative analysis of drum tuning with respect to performance sound, studio recording and music production. Digital signal analysis has been used to quantify a number of acoustic related factors to drum setup and tuning. This is concerned with the evaluation of a drum\u0027s free vibration once excitation has occurred. Novel analysis of membranophone response is performed with respect to tuning an \u0027equalised drumhead\u0027. Such analysis has not previously been performed on cylindrical drums with two heads. The findings show that it is indeed possible to tune a drum to a chosen, uniform frequency response and to a quantified accuracy. With reference to previous, non-scientific literature, the fundamental frequency of each drum in the modern drum kit is shown for the first time to be objectively tunable to correspond to a musical pitch. The research also investigates the role of the resonant head in tuning cylindrical drums. Unique analysis of the interaction between the two membranes shows for the first time that the ratios of the modal frequencies present in a drum sound are not fixed and can be manipulated to more desirable ratios. The fundamental frequently present is shown to be the same for both batter and resonant heads due to the strong coupling effect of the (01) modes. Furthermore the current research shows how this ability to manipulate the frequencies present in the drum can be extended to the drum kit as a whole and how the envelope profile of cylindrical drums with two heads can be manipulated via tuning and damping. This research therefore provides an original contribution to the knowledge of drum tuning for both scientific and musical purposes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Richardson, Philip"],"dc:date":"2011-11-08T08:49:05Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K U Ingard.

Foraging is one behaviour that may be particularly important in this respect; many species will continue to work for food even when it is freely available. The role of substrate, and in particular particle size, on the foraging behaviour of goldfish (Carassius auratus) was examined through three repeated measures experiments. In the first, tanks were set up with five uniform substrates: plastic grid, coarse sand, fine gravel, pebbles, and cobbles. In the second, fish were provided with a choice between coarse sand and fine gravel, fine gravel and pebbles, and pebbles and cobbles. In the third, they were provided with two choices between coarse sand and cobbles, one where the sand contained more food and one where the cobbles did. Our results show that particle size significantly affected the amount of time goldfish spent foraging, and that goldfish exhibited foraging behaviour even in the absence of a substrate they can manipulate. Goldfish foraged longest when provided with coarse sand. Fish foraged significantly longer over smaller particle size substrates when given a choice,\nalthough they did not distinguish between the two finest substrates, coarse sand and gravel. Increases in total time spent foraging were achieved through more, rather than longer, bouts. Food density did not significantly alter preference for smaller particle substrates. In general, coarse sand (1.5 mm) was found to be the most appropriate substrate in terms of facilitating natural foraging behaviours. These findings are discussed with respect to the welfare and husbandry of goldfish and aquarium fish in general.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Andrew C.","Gray, H."],"dc:date":"2011-11-14T12:20:19Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26012,"sim:weight":0.351768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26013,"sim:weight":0.351768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43880,"sim:weight":0.325106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631548,"sim:weight":0.244268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933163,"sim:weight":0.23458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.224905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496191,"sim:weight":0.223953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Plant exudates are exploited both routinely and opportunistically by at least sixty nine species of strepsirrhine, platyrrhine and catarrhine primates. Gummivory is particularly prevalent among the callitrichids, cheirogaleids and galagos in terms of the number of species reported to consume gum, its contribution to their diet, and the number of plant species they exploit for it. While some marmosets, galagos and the fork-marked lemur are thought of as gum specialists, exudates may account for more than 10% of the diet in many other species. Gum feeding may increase further during periods of dry season resource scarcity, with some, most notably Parkia pod gums, acting as a keystone resource for many New World monkeys. Exudates from at least 250 plant species in 170 genera and 63 families are eaten, with Fabaceae and Anacardiaceae be-ing the most frequently exploited. The Callitrichidae were examined for patterns in the amount of gum they consumed. Differences in the prevalence of gummivory were linked to morphological ad-aptations, particularly dentition, and habitat seasonality. Cluster analysis of the plant families ex-ploited by different primate genera revealed similarities based on the number of families they ex-ploited for gums.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Andrew C."],"dc:date":"2011-12-19T12:28:39Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana and Iquitos Moynihan M.

These are then examined for mixed-species troops of saddleback (S. fuscicollis) and mustached (S. mystax) tamarins. An important distinction is made between gums produced by tree trunks and branches as a result of damage and those produced by seed pods as part of a dispersal strategy as these may be expected to differ in their biochemistry. Feeding on fruit and Parkia seed pod exudates was more prevalent in the morning whereas other exudates were eaten in the afternoon. This itinerary may represent a deliberate strategy to retain trunk gums in the gut overnight, thus maximising the potential for microbial fermentation of their β-linked oligosaccharides. Both types of exudates were eaten more in the dry than the wet season. Consumption was linked to seasonal changes in resource availability and not the tamarins’ reproductive status pro-viding no support for the suggestion that gums are eaten as a pri-mary calcium source in the later stages of gestation and lactation. The role of availability in determining patterns of consumption is further supported by the finding that dietary overlap for the trunk gums eaten was greater between species within mixed-species troops within years than it was within species between years. These data and those for pygmy marmosets (Cebuella pygmaea) suggest that patterns of primate gummivory may reflect the interaction of prefer-ence and availability for both those able to stimulate gum production and those not.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Andrew C."],"dc:date":"2011-12-19T12:28:23Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Adrian and M Assoumani.

New measures of database performance are required when users are familiar with search engines, and expect full text availability.\nObjectives:  This research ascertained which of four bibliographic databases (BNI, CINAHL, MEDLINE and EMBASE) could be considered most useful to nursing and midwifery students searching for information for an undergraduate dissertation.\nMethods:  Searches on title were performed for dissertation topics supplied by nursing students (n \u003d 9), who made the relevance judgements. Measures of recall and precision were combined with additional factors to provide measures of effectiveness, while efficiency combined measures of novelty and originality and accessibility combined measures for availability and retrievability, based on obtainability.\nResults:  There were significant differences among the databases in precision, originality and availability, but other differences were not significant (Friedman test). Odds ratio tests indicated that BNI, followed by CINAHL were the most effective, CINAHL the most efficient, and BNI the most accessible.\nConclusions:  The methodology could help library services in purchase decisions as the measure for accessibility, and odds ratio testing helped to differentiate database performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stokes, Peter","Foster, Allen","Urquhart, Christine"],"dc:date":"2011-12-20T10:55:45Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1471-1842.2008.00822.x","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H Greisdorf and A Spink.

Physicians often gathered their own books which were sometimes donated to create early medical libraries. The explosion of information, the demands of qualification accrediting bodies and technological developments have also helped to promote the work of health libraries. The professionalisation of health occupations has tended to move their library support from hospitals into academic settings. Librarians are increasingly concerned with promoting their services and teaching patrons to use library resources. While some health sciences librarians see the availability of health information on the internet as a threat, to those that can see ways to exploit it, it may serve to enhance their role.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wakeham, Maurice"],"dc:date":"2011-12-20T16:36:51Z","doi":"10.1080/13614530903279237","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Peg Burnette and Jo Dorsch.

Concepts such as the \u0027four Ps\u0027 (product, price, place and promotion), marketing plans, the marketing mix, segmentation, promotion and evaluation are identified and discussed in relation to health libraries.\nCONCLUSION: In increasingly complex health service and information environments, the marketing and promotion of library services is becoming more important if those services are to justify the resources given to them. Marketing techniques are equally applicable to physical and digital library services.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wakeham, Maurice"],"dc:date":"2012-01-04T12:30:55Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1471-1842.2004.00540.x","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Swaffield.

A programme of academic-oriented language support, including both the APU-originated CD-ROM Excel at Academic English and specific workshop sessions, has been developed. This programme is piloted with the 2000-2001 cohort, and accompanied by action research which includes focus group interviews and mid-year evaluation of the support and development programme. It has led to radical overhaul of elements of the course itself, with widespread implications for support and development for international postgraduates studying at APU.","bibo:AuthorList":["Griffiths, Sylvia","Wisker, Gina","Waller, Sharon","Illes, Katalin","Wu, Su"],"dc:date":"2011-06-15T15:35:02Z","doi":"10.1080/14703290110056344","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.391487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.388919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.379561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8313,"sim:weight":0.377253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55554,"sim:weight":0.368687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387358,"sim:weight":0.367303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.366763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.364635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270217,"sim:weight":0.359934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.354473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.35262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1134246,"sim:weight":0.348214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16185,"sim:weight":0.347714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46811,"sim:weight":0.344261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664559,"sim:weight":0.343348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43997,"sim:weight":0.342608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.341979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.339183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85336,"sim:weight":0.336622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.332892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Moreover, that, employers would seek to gain their commitment by adopting the high working practices of high performance working (HPW) for organisations to become successful through their strategic approach to the human resource (HR). It is against Watson\u0027s model that this paper seeks, in order to gain insights, to explore the perceptions of current HR professionals of their organisations post-2000. Design/methodology/approach: A survey design is used for the study to collect data over a four-week period in February 2006 from 100 HR professionals. Using a seven-point Likert scale questionnaire, adapted from Watson\u0027s model, the study is conducted in two phases. The first initial pilot study that surveys 30 HR professionals and after modification, this is extended to a further 70 HR professionals as Phase 2. The respondents are primarily drawn from organisations in the South East of England and they are employed in both public and private sector large organisations and SMEs. Findings: The findings show that Watson\u0027s model for HPW was inconsistent with the choices selected by the respondents within the survey. Rather than choose descriptors from the model that solely reflect traditional (mechanistic) organisations or high performance organisations (organic), respondents chose descriptors with many combinations to reflect where they perceive their organisation\u0027s practices fell, e.g. organic or rigid/bureaucratic. Practical implications: This paper demonstrates a need for an appreciation of the potential gap between employer\u0027s aspirations and employee\u0027s perceptions of organisational actions. In so noting, it recognises that the psychological contract depends upon the perceptions of both parties. Whilst the high level commitment sought by employers from employees, through HPW, may rely totally upon these very perceptions of employees (employability contract vs psychological contract). If not, perceptions of the “reality” within the organisation may not reflect rhetoric of, or aspiration towards, HPW. As a result, this research adds to the understanding of the dynamics and results from the management of change towards HPW. Therefore, it provides also early indications to further research needed when considering the importance of investigating such dynamics to successful implementation of HPW. Originality/value: Whilst these results are early indications into working practices post-2000, what they suggest is that HR professionals generally perceive a move towards HPW practices being adopted by other organisations, rather than within their own working environment. It appears to be the most compelling feature of the study to date, is that most of the participants do not report their review of the current practices of their company as generally falling towards Watson\u0027s HPW model practices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Keeble-Ramsay, Diane","Armitage, Andrew M.D."],"dc:date":"2011-09-20T11:37:02Z","doi":"10.1108/17542731011009595","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664727,"sim:weight":0.403403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44175,"sim:weight":0.273978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101370,"sim:weight":0.25758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81370,"sim:weight":0.255517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340561,"sim:weight":0.246417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101228,"sim:weight":0.235886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Such local based evidence, if found, would encourage the inclusion of CSR as part of strategic management of companies in Israel. The investigation focused on a sample of leading companies in Israel, forming part of the TA-100 stock exchange index, and was undertaken between 2005 and 2006. The research used quantitative investigation of secondary data on financial performance that is available for companies traded on the stock exchange. It included social responsibility ranking undertaken by the association of \u0027Business for social responsibility in Israel\u0027 – MAALA. This data was used to compare financial performance between groups of companies with different levels of social responsibility. The research found that higher social responsibility for companies in Israel was associated with higher financial performance, in comparison to their counterpart companies ranked as lower in social responsibility. However at the extreme, a very high level of social responsibility is associated with decline in financial performance. The research conclusion was that companies in Israel face the same CSR-to-CFP relationship, as their counterparts in leading western economies. This provides the rationale for Israeli companies to incorporate social responsibility as part of their business strategy aimed at improving financial performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marom, Yeshayahu"],"dc:date":"2011-11-08T08:58:28Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G Burrell and G Morgan.

{"identifier":363616,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"From locked cupboard to University Library: libraries for nurses in the UK after 1955","bibo:abstract":"This paper presents an outline of the history of library provision for nurses in the second half of the twentieth century. The few libraries for nurses that existed in the fifties were usually attached to Schools of Nursing and often run by volunteers, clerical assistants or nurse tutors. In an organisation where the emphasis was on training and skills development rather than education and reflection and the prime aim was maintaining a health service with limited resources, provision of books and journals for theoretical learning had a low priority. In turn nurses gained a reputation as people who did not read.\n\nIn order to respond to problems of staff morale, recruitment and retention, in the last decade of the century attempts were made to make nursing more attractive by giving pre-registration learners student status, encouraging a research-based approach to learning and absorbing it into higher education. However many of the problems facing libraries would not be quickly resolved. \n\nAn attempt will be made to explain library provision for nurses with reference to the generation of knowledge in nursing and its relationship to library based knowledge. This will touch on the role and status of the nurse, the nature of her work and training, the ideological foundations of the nursing profession and the impact that these have on the provision of library services.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wakeham, Maurice"],"dc:date":"2012-02-09T15:30:31Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G Thompson.

This study examines the effect of the integration programme on service users. Previous research into health and social care integrations predominantly centre on process issues and pay much less attention to outcomes. No study has evaluated the impact of fully-integrated care services for the whole user group of older people.  Theory-led programmatic approach was used in this study. Multi-method data collection and analysis were employed to uncover and examine the causal links, the contextual conditions, the implementation process, causal mechanisms, and intended and achieved outcomes of the integration programme. This study reveals an improvement in the physical functioning of one in three occupational equipment users; a rise in the level of satisfaction of 85% of occupational health and 82% of physiotherapy users; older people with complex problems and high-level needs were able to be helped to live at home; and waiting time for both assessment and for services within two weeks and four weeks were below the national achievement and the ministerial targets. It also reveals a lack of change outcomes in social care, and service users’ low level of satisfaction with social care services, which appear to be associated with the privatisation of long-term social care and the predominant aim in social work of achieving maintenance and prevention outcomes. The integration programme’s goals—unifying the care system, easier and simpler access to services and a single and quick assessment—were not fully reached, mainly because of users’ low awareness of the integration, incompatible ICT systems and lack of funding. This study contributes to knowledge on how the total integration in Cambridgeshire has benefited users and how theory-led programmatic approach can be used in this area and in the study of this kind of complex social programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hu, Mei"],"dc:date":"2012-02-20T12:49:01Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91704,"sim:weight":0.519863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666846,"sim:weight":0.493784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103670,"sim:weight":0.483524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":199795,"sim:weight":0.439661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731320,"sim:weight":0.421728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43727,"sim:weight":0.357421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43408,"sim:weight":0.354997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.338784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81039,"sim:weight":0.333674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.333672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496274,"sim:weight":0.307214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.302853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664721,"sim:weight":0.287041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.286789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383611,"sim:weight":0.275059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145895,"sim:weight":0.274766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.2685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91075,"sim:weight":0.268322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668527,"sim:weight":0.266425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.261179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Sale-and-leaseback has become an increasingly common approach during the last two decades for the holding of British banking-halls. One measure used in making property investment decisions is the all risks yield (ARY). Investors and their advisors have a need for a predictive framework which they can use for predicting those retail bank premises likely to achieve the highest ARY when assembling investment portfolios of such properties. A predictive framework necessitates the identification of those factors significantly influencing the yields of British banking-halls. This research aims to develop such a framework. Triangulation methodology was adopted to establish and test the predictive framework. A literature review established theory before a qualitative study, based upon semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire, was used to establish the influencing factors. A cross-sectional study of auction data then formed the basis of the quantitative regression study. The qualitative and quantitative studies validated that four factors were significant in influencing yield. These were tenant banking company, lot size, super-region and the macro-economic cycle index. A toolkit comprising a predictive framework for those banking-halls likely to produce the highest ARY was produced. This is capable of being used by professional practitioners and investors in predicting high yield for portfolio building purposes. The predictive framework was developed based upon the quantitative data from those three banks with the most premises sold by sale-and-leaseback. It formed a baseline from which further studies can build to test its significance for other banks. Consequently, a more robust predictive framework can be developed for banking-hall investments. Further research can also be conducted to develop predictive frameworks forecasting yields for investment in other commercial retail sectors, based upon the findings of this research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tipping, Malvern"],"dc:date":"2012-02-20T12:22:41Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"100m Sony leaseback (2005) Estates Gazette,","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"100m Sony leaseback (2005) Estates Gazette,"},{"rawReferenceText":"(2006). 46.6m taken at C\u0026W‟","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"46.6m taken at C\u0026W‟","dc:date":"2006"},{"rawReferenceText":"Abbey falls into £2m VAT trap (2006) „Abbey falls into £2m VAT trap‟,","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"Abbey falls into £2m VAT trap (2006) „Abbey falls into £2m VAT trap‟,"},{"rawReferenceText":"(2006).

{"identifier":363619,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Thesis"],"bibo:shortTitle":"A critical comparative analysis of racial integration laws and its impact on professional team sports","bibo:abstract":"The following research aims to examine the interaction of law, either hard law (legislation) or soft law (governing body regulation), on achieving a balance between racial equality and success in sport. Nearly all national jurisdictions have legislated to some degree in an attempt to affect equality or equality of opportunity for its citizens. This might be based on achieving equality of opportunity or by means of affirmative action. The research aim is to ascertain how far racial discrimination laws have positive or negative impacts on the success of sports in different countries. The research also has a series of supplementary objectives:\nto ascertain and consider critically the extent to which the law in various jurisdictions (Malaysia, South Africa, England and the United States) has been used to promote equality; to develop a sequential model to describe general trends to predict the influence of affirmative action and equal opportunity legislation upon the potential success of countries’ sporting achievements; to review tensions inherent in reconciling the equality of citizens at a national level and their impacts upon the international sporting success of that nation; to establish a correlative relationship between the types of anti-discrimination law within nations and the impact of these upon the degree of international sporting success of those nations. The research conducted concentrates primarily on qualitative methods by first adopting a doctrinal approach in a comparative legal study of four jurisdictions (Malaysia, South Africa, England and the United States). A non-doctrinal approach is then adopted and a qualitative intrinsic case study completed, including interviews concerning the subject area. Thus, the research has used multi-method qualitative approaches. The research indicated different anti-discrimination approaches taken in achieving equality. This can be typified by countries such as the United States or England based primarily on meritocracy and countries such as South Africa and Malaysia based primarily on preferential treatment. There is evidence to suggest that these approaches do have a certain correlation, albeit not similar in the outcome of achieving equality for selection. From the evidence presented, the overall study illustrates that racial discrimination laws in the four jurisdictions produced a mixed outcome in relation to the success of professional team sports. Specifically, England and the United States witnessed a positive impact in terms of achieving international success in sports even though there are inherent difficulties in reconciling the equality of citizens at a national level. For Malaysia and South Africa, the result tends to be positive in general at this stage although it is equally recognised that this approach might result in some negative impacts in the long run. The research however is subject to certain limitations which are outside the scope of this thesis, but it is recognised that these might affect the overall success of professional team sports within those countries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khoo, Teng Guan"],"dc:date":"2012-02-20T12:11:56Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6581,"sim:weight":0.491763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7441,"sim:weight":0.467349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77929,"sim:weight":0.444394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93553,"sim:weight":0.435282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95108,"sim:weight":0.425718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":212795,"sim:weight":0.421789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95628,"sim:weight":0.421338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94845,"sim:weight":0.411727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93562,"sim:weight":0.408352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94711,"sim:weight":0.397142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":221303,"sim:weight":0.382898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7268,"sim:weight":0.378494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95728,"sim:weight":0.37665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":221087,"sim:weight":0.360171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95724,"sim:weight":0.354105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94797,"sim:weight":0.348285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":120209,"sim:weight":0.343825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47285,"sim:weight":0.340667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":221527,"sim:weight":0.338457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7157,"sim:weight":0.319504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It\nis designed to develop a foundation which can shape and enhance the policy and provision of the CSLD. It seeks to answer two questions: How do Salvation Army officers sustain and develop their personal spiritual life in the context of an activist, missional organisation? In what ways can the Centre for Spiritual life Development facilitate and support this process? The research methodology is qualitative, bringing responses to a written questionnaire and semi-structured interviews into mutual critical dialogue with the conceptual framework, which is drawn from the theology and history of evangelicalism and evangelical spirituality, and the theory of theological and vocational education. This has generated a rich description of spiritual life development in Salvation Army officers in the 21st century, leading to new understanding. The empirical research focused upon a particular constituency, delegates to the\nInternational College for Officers, thus facilitating understanding of the difference\nencountered in an organisation that has both global and local influences. It confirmed\nan expected diversity of understanding and practice in three major areas; definitions\nof, and practices leading to, spiritual life development; the means used by officers\ndevelop their spiritual lives; and the relationship between practice and the spiritual life. The work contributes to academic knowledge about The Salvation Army by locating the organisation, and Salvationist spirituality, within the framework of evangelicalism. A proposal to encourage a holistic understanding of spiritual life development using a process of reflection based upon the integration of, and interrelationships between, ‘knowing, being and doing’, offers a way forward that is applicable in a range of contexts. The evolution of my professional practice during the period of the research demonstrates that the foundations of new policy and practices are taking shape. It therefore contributes to the field of practical theology, as the integration and mutual critique of practice, spirituality and educational theory have led to new understanding and new practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shakespeare, Karen"],"dc:date":"2012-02-20T12:09:13Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Charles R Foster, Dahill Lisa E, Golemon Lawrence A and Barbara Wang Tolentino.

{"identifier":363621,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Thesis"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The internationalisation process of small and medium-sized management consultancies in the UK","bibo:abstract":"This thesis focuses on how small to medium-sized management consultancies internationalise, as this is an under-researched area. Investigation focuses on\nidentifying the factors that facilitate international market success for these small\nto medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the challenges they encounter, and how those challenges have been overcome. The relevance of SME internationalisation theories is explored for SME management consultancies in the UK. The study is exploratory, phenomenological and framed within an interpretive research paradigm. Primary data was gathered qualitatively using multiple (9)\ncase studies, collected principally through semi-structured interviews. This empirical research, one of the first to focus solely on SME management consultancies, finds the owner/founders as the key driver of internationalisation. Their past experience enables an international outlook and brings established networks to firm formation. The findings highlight the relevance of intangible resources: the firms’ skills, competencies and networking capabilities, as integral to successful internationalisation. Additional key critical success factors are niche market specialisation, firm reputation, firm location, ability for service provision\nmodification and the role of technology. There are observed firm size-related\ndifferences in the challenges these firms face, with smaller-sized firms being more\nvulnerable to challenges from the external environment, including the 2008 financial crisis. Firms are able to overcome these challenges with the help of their\nnetworks. Other challenges stem from the firm’s service provision: difficulty in finding skilled staff and communication with clients. The findings suggest applicability for other knowledge-intensive firms. The research contributes to closing the gap in literature on how firms successfully provide services internationally and in so doing advances theoretical understanding of SME service internationalisation. This theory-building research demonstrates partial relevance of Stage Theory, Networking Theory, and Born Global Theory, but overall the resource-based view was found as the most\nrelevant to understanding the internationalisation process of SME management consultancies. This sets a foundation for further research on the internationalisation process of other knowledge-intensive firms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Deprey, Brynn Darin"],"dc:date":"2012-02-20T12:05:59Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383594,"sim:weight":0.476426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383420,"sim:weight":0.349429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45037,"sim:weight":0.341985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269906,"sim:weight":0.294353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387323,"sim:weight":0.287656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.284361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383342,"sim:weight":0.250852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46854,"sim:weight":0.238566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104148,"sim:weight":0.201596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383675,"sim:weight":0.197607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99068,"sim:weight":0.187734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44617,"sim:weight":0.187369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45128,"sim:weight":0.17641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99451,"sim:weight":0.170118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387372,"sim:weight":0.166524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.158165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.124831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":363623,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Thesis"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Supporting Buddhist identity in long-term care situations","bibo:abstract":"The Triratna/FWBO Buddhist movement has been associated with younger people and a lifestyle in which single sex residential communities and work projects (TBRLs) have\nbeen prominent. There is now a trend towards a wider range of lifestyles including fewer people living communally. Demographic changes include 50+ average age for ordained members and some people developing Long-Term Care (LTC) needs, with limited family and financial support. This raises questions as to the extent to which ‘Buddhist identity’ can be supported in LTC situations, with informal care, mainstream LTC services and possible care-based TBRLs all relevant.Data-gathering was initially on the basis of a general investigation of LTC issues in Triratna/FWBO using an eclectic, primarily qualitative design which had features of both a case study and a cross-sectional survey. 17 interviews included participants with current LTC needs, others asked to anticipate future care preferences, and people with relevant expertise. A questionnaire was formulated to explore attitudes to possible care-based TBRLs, with 107 participants and numerous additional comments. There was a strong consensus that Buddhist-based LTC services would, for example, provide better vegetarian diets and have an understanding of Buddhist names taken at ordination. These features were included in a conceptualisation of Buddhist identity which contrasted ‘Buddhist’ and ‘Non-Buddhist’ life, and noted ‘Dreams’ and ‘Nightmares’ as to LTC. Effective basic\ncare was seen as essential to the general level of well-being needed for Buddhist\npractice, whilst a higher level of support might facilitate access to Buddhist ‘life goods’, and assist people in self-verifying themselves as committed Buddhists through ongoing practice. Informal support from fellow Buddhists was available in many contexts, but not at levels of intensity and duration characteristic of some family-based care, and it was seen as modulated by perceptions of burden, ‘busy-ness’ and other factors. There was a ‘legacy of suspicion’ of mainstream LTC, mainly focussed on residential care, with acknowledgement of some good/respectful carers and care services. TBRLs in LTC were generally welcomed, being seen as suitably altruistic work which might feature an atmosphere of ‘mutuality’ between staff and clients who were Buddhist or of Buddhist sympathy. Comparative material was used here from Methodist, Jewish and Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender (LGBT) communities in LTC contexts, with the last\nof these conceptualised as comparable to the Western Buddhist community as a currently emerging identity in terms of later life services. Practicality and feasibility\nwere discussed with reference to existing TBRLs, and experience of paid-for care input\nbetween Buddhists. The latter appeared supportive of Buddhist identity and readily\nlinked to the personalisation agenda in social care. Buddhist-friendly services were\nseen as a possible context for generativity, and the concept of ‘a natural part of life’ was explored in terms of the emergence of LTC in the Triratna/FWBO movement, and of Buddhism as a gradually more familiar identity which might be encountered in the sphere of LTC.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hillary, Martin Ambrose"],"dc:date":"2012-02-20T11:57:00Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Durham.

The purpose of this study was to gather data and listen to the voices and opinions of families of children with TS in order to examine the extent to which the existence of a child with TS, in the family, affected their FQOL. The research was conducted according to the mixed methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Data was collected concerning the research population that included all the families who have a child with TS living at home, and registered at the Tourette Syndrome Organisation in Israel. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were\nconducted with 10 of these 25 families of children with TS. The questionnaire was analysed statistically and the interviews were analysed using a content analysis method. Conclusions derived from the research findings allowed the emergence of the ACEIST model, including five new sub-domains of FQOL that reflect the experiences of the studied families: Advocacy, cooperation, explanation,\ninformation, and severity of TS. This is a new way to view FQOL of families having a child with TS, very precise and operative and specific to those families. This ACEIST model fills the gap in knowledge identified in this field, contributing to knowledge regarding FQOL of families who have a child with TS. The new model has practical implications for the education, social and health policies in Israel regarding families who have a child with TS.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khoury, Rita"],"dc:date":"2012-02-20T11:49:18Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A. et al.,(2005).

{"identifier":363625,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Thesis"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Bcl-xL deamidation in oncogenic tyrosine kinase signalling.","bibo:abstract":"I have been interested in the molecular mechanisms of Haematopoietic malignant diseases such as leukaemia and lymphoma, especially those involving oncogenic tyrosine kinases. About 30 of the 90 tyrosine kinases in the human genome have been implicated in cancer (Blume-Jensen P, 2001). The oncogenic tyrosine kinases (OTKs), such as Bcr-Abl (product of chromosomal translocations of two genes bcr and abl) in Chronic Myelogenous Leukaemia, and Erythroblastic leukaemia viral\noncogene homolog 2(Erb-B2) in mammary and other cancers, mediate their transforming effects via a diverse array of signalling pathways involved in DNA damage, cell survival and cell cycle regulation (Deutsch E, 2001; Skorski T, 2002; Kumar R, 1996).\nMy work has been centred around the analysis of a mouse cancer model that is driven by an oncogenic tyrosine kinase – p56 Lck-F505 expressed on CD45 knock- out background (Baker M, 2000). The investigation of this mouse model has revealed that oncogenic inhibition of deamidation of the Bcl-xL survival protein plays a critical role in protecting thymocytes from DNA-damage induced apoptosis. Cells that would normally be eliminated due to accumulating DNA damage are instead preserved with an increasing load of double-stranded breaks, leading to genomic instability, chromosomal abnormalities and transformation. This work was published in Cancer Cell (An oncogenic tyrosine kinase inhibits DNA repair and DNA-damage-induced BclxL deamidation in T cell transformation. Zhao R, 2004). Following that I have tried to\nelucidate the different roles of the two  deamidated species of Bcl-xL in apoptosis, and also the molecular mechanisms of DNA damage- induced Bcl-xL deamidation in order\nto understand the inhibition of Bcl-xL deamidation by oncogenic tyrosine kinases.\nRecently I have shown that Bcl-xL deamidation, whereby two critical Asn residues are converted to iso-Asp, cripples the ability of the protein to sequester pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins such as Bim and p53- upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), thereby explaining its loss of pro-survival functionality. In vivo, DNA damage causes intracellular alkalinisation that is both necessary and sufficient to deamidate Bcl-xL, promoting apoptosis: no enzyme is necessary for this process. In pre-tumourigenic thymocytes alkalinisation is blocked, so preserving Bcl-xL in its pro-survival mode. Furthermore murine tumours are protected from genotoxic attack by native Bcl-xL, but enforced alkalinisation and consequent Bcl-xL deamidation promotes apoptosis. This part of work was published in Plos Biology (DNA damage-induced Bcl-xL deamidation is mediated by NHE-1 antiport regulated intracellular pH. Zhao R, 2007). Through collaboration with Prof AR Green’s research group at the Department of Haematology of the University of Cambridge, I have also analysed the Bcl-xL deamidation pathway in human myeloproliferative disorders, e.g. Polycythemia vera(PV) and Chronic Myelogenous Leukaemia (CML). We found that the oncogenic tyrosine kinases involved in these disorders, i.e. Jak2V617F and Bcr-Abl also inhibit the Bcl-xL deamidation pathway in DNA damage responses. These findings shed light on potential therapeutic application of the Bcl-xL deamidation pathway in human malignancies. This piece of work was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Inhibition of the Bcl-xL deamidation pathway in myeloproliferative disorders. Zhao R, 2008). Overall the cited work has led to several important new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in oncogenesis: first, that Bcl-xL deamidation is important in the cascade of events leading from DNA damage to apoptosis; second, that oncogenic tyrosine kinases inhibit these events in both the murine and human context; third, that up-regulation of the NHE-1 antiport and consequent intracellular alkalinisation are critical events in this DNA damage-induced cascade leading to apoptosis. In the process I have demonstrated the first in vivo mechanism for the deamidation of an internal protein Asn. Essentially, a completely new and unexpected signalling pathway has been uncovered that seems to pertain to all murine and human haematopoietic cell lineages that have been investigated so far.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhao, Rui"],"dc:date":"2012-02-29T16:22:03Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Green AR GA and Alexander DR.

While this is one of the ‘lesser known phyla’ the group forms an important element of Antarctic non-marine ecosystems. My work has centred on four interrelated themes: i) taxonomy, predominantly Tardigrada and with an Antarctic bias though including wider global species and high taxon groupings (I have also worked on other taxa such as Fungi-imperfecti and freshwater invertebrates); ii) biodiversity of tardigrades, particularly Antarctic habitats; iii) data-based studies based on the terrestrial Tardigrada and Antarctic freshwater crustaceans; and iv) biogeographic analysis of these databases. The thesis presented consists of papers published in major, peer-reviewed journals, along with book chapters published and in press. Several of my papers have been cited 10-30 times according to the ISI Web of Science citation system. Highlights of my work include being the first to publish a paper on the global terrestrial biogeography of a phylum and showing the extant limno-terrestrial tardigrade fauna reflect the early tectonic break-up of the Laurasia, West and East Gondwana super continents between 65 and 135 million years ago.","bibo:AuthorList":["McInnes, Sandra J."],"dc:date":"2012-03-19T15:53:49Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":64159,"sim:weight":0.438309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55410,"sim:weight":0.434271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88210,"sim:weight":0.388851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65128,"sim:weight":0.35681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382175,"sim:weight":0.278406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58047,"sim:weight":0.241882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58019,"sim:weight":0.227794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382177,"sim:weight":0.216616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31144,"sim:weight":0.211619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31020,"sim:weight":0.197885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.197188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97878,"sim:weight":0.19424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732009,"sim:weight":0.19143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9019729,"sim:weight":0.18914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9541378,"sim:weight":0.189019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.173548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77541,"sim:weight":0.170661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62227,"sim:weight":0.168737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.16844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.16844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It will be suggested here that Ratcatcher\u0027s multi-sensory investment in a \u0027low-plane reality\u0027 works to reclaim some of the possibilities that Kracauer and other modern film theorists conferred upon the medium of cinema. However, in contrast to Kracauer\u0027s insistence on the \u0027redemptive\u0027 mission of cinema, it draws from the recent body of \u0027new materialist\u0027 theory in order to reframe cinema\u0027s relations with things. Through attentiveness to what Elizabeth Grosz calls the \u0027in-between of things\u0027, this paper develops an argument about the materiality of things that also accounts for the materiality of the cinema as a thing, and for the immanent relations it establishes with other media forms. The paper draws from the concept of intermediality, to suggest that this heightened awareness of materiality emerges most powerfully in Ratcatcher\u0027s creation of an interstitial space between film, art and the real. In turn, the paper suggests that it is ultimately in privileging the still life of things that Ratcatcher most powerfully foregrounds cinema\u0027s affective and aesthetic potential.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kendall, Tina"],"dc:date":"2012-04-23T12:47:28Z","doi":"10.1080/17400301003700327","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.275188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.217852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108957,"sim:weight":0.209269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The project was motivated partly by the dearth of such learning practices on the Legal Practice Course.

This in turn has led to a change in the way in which they want to participate, and are participating in research and in particular in their roles as researchers alongside adults.    This paper seeks to add to the debate regarding children as researchers by exploring the reality of their participation in research. A critique of existing models of children’s participation is followed by an account of observations made during two participatory research projects. Although existing models offered a variety of criteria against which to measure participation, none allowed for the multidimensional nature of participation that emerged from the data to be fully described. The subsequent development of a dual axis model of participation, used to reflect on the participatory processes, is then described.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moules, Tina","O\u0027Brien, Niamh"],"dc:date":"2012-04-23T09:12:12Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.322774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.29561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.263241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.255434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Antheil’s inexorable essay in noise was appropriately realised through instruments of his present – mechanically-operated pianos, percussion instruments, airplane propellers, electric bells and sirens – enabling a level of complexity of temporal organisation hitherto unknown. Antheil’s ideas also gained enthusiastic support from Ezra\nPound who, in Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony (1924), argued that music should delineate itself principally by its passage through time, rather than by its ‘state’ at any moment in time. In the process, Pound reasserts the notion of the primacy of a predominantly temporally-informed mode of perception: music as a phenomenon existing in time-space, and articulating time-form. Ballet mécanique seeks to embody a realisation of these concepts, ‘wherein time functioning in music differs from ordinary time and the series of deductive and also physical phenomena that follow it.’ In Ballet mécanique, the compression and expansion of events within time moments, the metamorphosis of events within a past-present-future paradigm, the utilisation of simultaneous time-series, and the placing of events in time frames that lie beyond the scope of human memory recall, are all enabled through a quasicomputational mode of composition. Whilst the manipulation of sound material in such ways\nis often the very stuff of music compositional practice, the use of machines in Ballet mécanique allowed for the construction of a previously unimagined (and unimaginable) temporally-constructed soundscape.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jackson, Paul"],"dc:date":"2012-03-29T10:21:30Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.256011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108179,"sim:weight":0.247679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.210446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.193225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109076,"sim:weight":0.192198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108303,"sim:weight":0.181322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.164274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.139734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86064,"sim:weight":0.132708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For centuries art has inspired many an intrepid traveller, and tourism provides an insatiable market for indigenous art, authentic or otherwise. This book explores the complex association between tourism and visual culture throughout history and across cultures. How has tourism been linked to images of colonial expansion? Why are we so intrigued by lost places, such as Tutankhamun\u0027s tomb or Machu Picchu, South Americas lost city of the Incas? What is the relationship between art, tourism and landscape preference? What role did commercial tourist photographers play in the imagination of Victorian Britain? Drawing upon examples from across the globe, this exciting new contribution to a popular subject illustrates how tourism and visual culture intersect with one another and in the process become contested ground. - summary from Copac record","bibo:AuthorList":["Lübbren, Nina (ed.)","Crouch, David (ed.)"],"dc:date":"2012-04-23T13:43:29Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Crouch and N Lubbren.

More specifically, the hypothesis was that there would be intraseries consistency in the distances travelled (spatial consistency) and the characteristics of the crime sites selected (environmental consistency) by serial sexual offenders. For spatial consistency to be tested, the distances travelled from home to offend and the criminal range for each offence series were analysed. Support was found for spatial consistency, and, in line with much overseas research, it was also found that the offenders typically did not travel very far from home to offend (median distance of 3 km). The environmental consistency measure was made up of various physical, temporal, and contextual variables that described the environmental characteristics of an offence. As hypothesised, it was found that offenders displayed intraseries environmental consistency in offence site selection beyond the level of that expected by chance. The implications of this both for understanding offender spatial decision making and for geographical profiling are discussed.

{"identifier":4895815,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Transition within transition: how young people learn to leave behind institutional care whilst their carers are stuck in neutral","bibo:abstract":"This paper discusses findings from a qualitative longitudinal study which explored the process of leaving long-stay institutional state care in Romania during 2002–4, a period at the heart of accelerated EU enforced childcare reform. 28 young people were interviewed before leaving care and 17 were tracked up to 8 months after discharge. 18 practitioners were also interviewed. The findings confirmed Pinkerton\u0027s (2006) emphasis on the impact of global and national factors on the individual experience of leaving care. This study took place in a country undergoing widespread change. The care leavers\u0027 irreversible transition took place within the simultaneous professional transition of their carers and that of the community with which they needed to integrate. This insight is widely relevant in the current\ncontext of public funding cuts and changes in welfare policy in many countries, including the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries.\nBridges (2009) was used to understand the experiences of care leavers and their carers. Bridges stresses the role of the leader in creating protective conditions for traversing three unavoidable transition stages: 1. ending old\nidentity/behaviour; 2. a neutral zone of deconstruction and transformation; and 3. a new beginning. Preparation for leaving care can be viewed as learning to end care, followed by the neutral zone which begins at discharge. When lacking family support, formal carers are the young people\u0027s main transition guides. However, their professional transition also needs management. Because of top-down, accelerated childcare reforms, the Romanian carers\u0027 transitions appeared stuck in the neutral zone, affecting preparation for leaving care. Yet, the availability of learning opportunities after discharge changed the nature of the neutral zone for most of the sample who did better than expected at follow-up. This, supported by Bridges\u0027 proposal that learning during transition influences future coping, offers a foundation for new theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anghel, Roxana"],"dc:date":"2012-04-23T13:01:48Z","doi":"10.1016/j.childyouth.2011.08.013","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.338318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.298183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.267034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108065,"sim:weight":0.147908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Altering procedures gives the appearance of change without necessarily improving practice. Do social workers have sufficient knowledge to make the decisions that they are responsible for? This paper examines whether a restricted knowledge base contributes to social workers missing or misjudging signs of maltreatment. The paper also looks at evidence suggesting that social workers are resistant to developing new ways of working. A more positive approach to developing expert knowledge and engagement with the inter-professional knowledge base is proposed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Akister, Jane"],"dc:date":"2012-04-10T14:34:01Z","doi":"10.1080/09503153.2011.620090","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Walker and J Akister.

Occupational therapists appear to have difficulty specifying goals and measuring the outcomes of interventions.\nAims: To measure the outcomes of therapies offered by occupational therapists and to assess concurrent validity of the Van du Toit Model of Creative Ability (VdT MoCA) assessment.\nMethod: The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), VdT MoCA assessment and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) were used. Changes in mean scores on the measures were assessed using appropriate tests. Correlations between measures were assessed using Spearman’s non-parametric test. Results: Mean post-therapy scores were significantly higher than pre-therapy scores on all three measures. VdT MoCA assessment scores pre- and post-therapy were highly correlated with GAF scores. The COPM outcome scores were uncorrelated with VdT MoCA assessment and GAF scores. Conclusions: The results offer a promising indication that occupational therapy interventions may increase functioning and thus aid clients’ recovery. The VdT MoCA assessment is promising as a measure of improvement in functioning. Further research is needed to confirm these results and to further explore issues around occupational therapists’ use of outcome measures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Samsonraj, Rajkumar S.P.","Loughran, Michael F.E.","Secker, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2012-04-24T12:38:12Z","doi":"10.3109/09638237.2011.638000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.237306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":363904,"sim:weight":0.179564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108284,"sim:weight":0.172982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.148558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This qualitative study complements previous evaluations of Pathways to Work by exploring customers’ perceptions of the impact of the Condition Management Programme (CMP) offered to claimants with long-term health conditions.\nMethods: 39 customers took part in focus groups held at the seven sites where Pathways was originally piloted. The main focus of the discussions was on perceptions of the ways in which participation had impacted on health, well-being and return to work. The discussions were audio-recorded and fully transcribed for analysis using a text analysis framework to enable the development and refinement of categories and overarching patterns in the data. \nResults: Perceived impacts on health and wellbeing included a more positive outlook, social contact, changed perceptions of conditions and improvements in health. Some customers also reported an increase in their vocational activity and others felt ready to embark on new activities. Factors associated with positive outcomes included the extent and quality of contact with CMP staff and practical advice about condition management. Factors impeding positive employment outcomes related mainly to obstacles to returning to work.\nConclusions: The results indicated that CMP can assist customers to learn about and manage their health conditions and increase their vocational activity, and that CMP therefore provides a promising means of enabling people with long-term health conditions to regain a fulfilling, productive life.","bibo:AuthorList":["Secker, Jenny","Pittam, Gail","Ford, Fiona"],"dc:date":"2012-04-24T09:42:46Z","doi":"10.1177/1757913911414772","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":363904,"sim:weight":0.264477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper reports the first phase of a study intended to support the development of stronger evidence. Objectives for the first phase were to map current participatory arts activity, to identify appropriate indicators, and to develop measures for use in the second phase of the research. A survey of participatory arts projects for people with mental health needs aged 16 to 65 in England, identified via the Internet and relevant organisations, was carried out to map the scale and scope of activity and to establish the nature of current approaches to evaluation. The results indicate that the scope of activity, in terms of projects’ settings, referral sources, art forms and participation is impressively wide. In terms of scale, however, projects reported low funding and staffing levels that may have implications for the feasibility of routine evaluation in this field. Current approaches to evaluation were limited, but entailed considerable effort and ingenuity, suggesting that projects are keen to demonstrate their benefits. The survey has enabled us to build on the best evaluation practice identified to develop a measure for assessing the mental health, social inclusion and empowerment outcomes of arts participation for people with mental health needs. For the second phase of the study we will work with arts and mental health projects, using the measure alongside qualitative work in a realistic evaluation design, in order to identify the characteristics of effective projects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hacking, Sue","Secker, Jenny","Kent, Lyn","Shenton, Jo","Spandler, Helen"],"dc:date":"2012-04-24T09:31:06Z","doi":"10.1177/1466424006064301","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"ODPM Mental.

Demand for instruments to monitor mental well-being at a population level and evaluate mental health promotion initiatives is growing. This article describes the development and validation of a new scale, comprised only of positively worded items relating to different aspects of positive mental health: the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). Methods: WEMWBS was developed by an expert panel drawing on current academic literature, qualitative research with focus groups, and psychometric testing of an existing scale. It was validated on a student and representative population sample. Content validity was assessed by reviewing the frequency of complete responses and the distribution of responses to each item. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the scale measured a single construct. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach\u0027s alpha. Criterion validity was explored in terms of correlations between WEMWBS and other scales and by testing whether the scale discriminated between population groups in line with pre-specified hypotheses. Test-retest reliability was assessed at one week using intra-class correlation coefficients. Susceptibility to bias was measured using the Balanced Inventory of Desired Responding. Results: WEMWBS showed good content validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the single factor hypothesis. A Cronbach\u0027s alpha score of 0.89 (student sample) and 0.91 (population sample) suggests some item redundancy in the scale. WEMWBS showed high correlations with other mental health and well-being scales and lower correlations with scales measuring overall health. Its distribution was near normal and the scale did not show ceiling effects in a population sample. It discriminated between population groups in a way that is largely consistent with the results of other population surveys. Test-retest reliability at one week was high (0.83). Social desirability bias was lower or similar to that of other comparable scales. Conclusion: WEMWBS is a measure of mental well-being focusing entirely on positive aspects of mental health. As a short and psychometrically robust scale, with no ceiling effects in a population sample, it offers promise as a tool for monitoring mental well-being at a population level. Whilst WEMWBS should appeal to those evaluating mental health promotion initiatives, it is important that the scale\u0027s sensitivity to change is established before it is recommended in this context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tennant, Ruth","Hiller, Louise","Fishwick, Ruth","Platt, Stephen","Joseph, Stephen","Weich, Scott","Parkinson, Jane","Secker, Jenny","Stewart-Brown, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2012-04-16T15:05:10Z","doi":"10.1186/1477-7525-5-63","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Watson, Clark LA and Tellegen.

More recently, music therapy has become a widespread practice, and this book reflects the variety of settings within which music therapists are now working with children together with their families. The contributors are music therapists with experience of working with children and their families in a range of different environments, such as schools, hospices, psychiatric units, child development centres and in the community. They describe their approaches to family work with client groups including children with autism, learning disabled toddlers, adopted children and looked after teenagers. Their experiences demonstrate that involving the family in a child\u0027s music therapy can be beneficial for everyone, and that it is possible to address relationship issues within the family as part of the treatment. This book will provide useful insight into the growing area of music therapy with children and their families, and will be valuable for music therapy professionals and students, as well as other medical and teaching professionals who work with families.","bibo:AuthorList":["Oldfield, Amelia (ed)","Flower, Claire (ed)"],"dc:date":"2012-04-10T14:23:35Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.28068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It shows how, in recent years, music therapy has changed and grown as a profession, and it provides an insight into the trends that are emerging in this area in the 21st century. Collating the experiences of a range of music therapists from both mainstream and special education backgrounds, \"Music Therapy in Schools\" explains the procedures, challenges and benefits of using music therapy in an educational context. These music therapists have worked with children of all ages and abilities from pre-school toddlers in nursery schools to teenagers preparing for further education, and address specific issues and disabilities including working with children with emotional and behavioural problems, and autistic spectrum disorders.

As Michael Rosen noted in his PhD thesis, trying to represent the writer’s point of view puts one in contention with the most respected theorists and critics: \"According to some I am dead (Barthes). To others whatever I intend is irrelevant (Wimsatt and Beardsley). And to yet others, the whole task is pointless because whatever I think that my writing-language is signifying, it is not (Saussure, Derrida); and anyway, in the final instance it\u0027s only the reader who knows what\u0027s written (Fish).\" In this paper I trace the development of my re-telling of the Lincolnshire folk tale, ‘Yallery Brown’, and how the processes of researching and adapting it for performance as a chamber opera, and subsequently for solo storytelling, helped shape the printed versions published by Scholastic and Ginn. I also present the idea of a ‘narrative environment’, a term I’m appropriating from interior design, and extending Henry James’s notion of the ‘house of fiction, to imagine a fantasy, multi-dimensional space in which stories are re-configured, re-interpreted and re-combined with other whole stories, fragments of stories, poems, songs, images, objects - part of a symbiosis which is not simply self-replicating but dynamically evolving.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gowar, Mick"],"dc:date":"2012-04-19T15:16:18Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.270441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.245948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86055,"sim:weight":0.228078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.224453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.221634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108987,"sim:weight":0.216656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I examine how they intersect, how the Spy System of Sidmouth worked to entrap potential rebels, and why there were so few radical responses to them. In 1820 the British government approached the possibility of revolution in two ways: repressive legislation; and the entrapment of potential rebels. In 1820 there were three ‘rebellions’ that, to varying extents, had their roots in government fomented plots: the Cato Street Conspiracy in February; the Cathkin rebellion in April; and the Bonnymuir rising in the same month. These three \u0027rebellions\u0027 are linked responses to demands for reform that had become increasingly heated following the ending of the wars. The results of these \u0027rebellions\u0027 were three public stages of execution. Five Cato Street \u0027conspirators\u0027 were executed together in London in May 1820; a 69 year old weaver, identified  as leader of the Cathkin rising, was hanged and beheaded in Glasgow Green in August, and two of the Bonnymuir men were executed in Stirling a month later. The killing of these men sent out a British-wide message that any rebellion would not only be detected, but also brutally crushed and it effectively put an end to the notion that a British revolution could be successful. These conspiracies revealed, as they were intended to, a strong well-organised state that was always vigilant, and always ready to deal with dissent, with methods that, though they may be morally reprehensible, were both innovative and effective.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gardner, John"],"dc:date":"2012-06-18T12:45:10Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":29199,"sim:weight":0.24593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108960,"sim:weight":0.211485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.211476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108857,"sim:weight":0.203955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.201635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.194838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.169962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108972,"sim:weight":0.163876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108703,"sim:weight":0.112483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Semistructured interviews were carried out with 21 academics who are both teachers and researchers. They proved to be committed to using research in their teaching. Students were encouraged to engage with research through the recommendation of resources, seminar discussion, and researchers’ own work for reading and illustrating methodologies. Respondents claimed to be making significant use of the APU library website, online databases and journals. The majority of them were also recommending the same resources to their students. Convenience, speed and variety of information sources were quoted as some of the advantages of the new e-environment.

The audio programming environment SuperCollider is used to define a series of musical functions and these functions are then distributed in time.  Each musical function includes a variety of parameters allowing significant variation between evaluations and these variations represent a significant part of the compositional detail.  The distribution in time is generally quite linear in this case, although there are a number of occasions in the scheduling where degrees of randomness are allowed to influence the timing and ordering of events.\nIn addition, the functions mentioned above include code for the conversion of algorithmic data into a format suitable for its display in conventional musical notation in real-time.  This means that the violinist’s part is not determined in detail until, usually, just before the moment of performance.  The general style and mood of the music is, however, quite predictable.\nThe result of this programming is, it is hoped, a balance between composed, improvised and performed electroacoustic music.  Although there are very few predetermined pitches or durations, the piece has clearly recognizable musical characteristics and structures and so to that extent represents an amalgamation of different styles of and approaches to music.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hoadley, Richard"],"dc:date":"2012-11-01T11:27:14Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The way that dancers interact with prototypical interfaces comprising clusters of sensors generating music algorithmically provides a method of investigating human actions in this environment.

Participants performed identification and discrimination tasks on morph series containing the self-face and a friend\u0027s face (self–Friend 1), two friends\u0027 faces (Friend 2–Friend 3), and two unfamiliar faces (Unfamiliar 1–Unfamiliar 2), presented in upright and inverted orientations. For upright faces, categorical perception effects were observed for both familiar morph series but not for the unfamiliar morph series, suggesting that robust representation is a requirement for categorical perception in facial identity. For inverted faces, categorical perception was observed for the self–Friend 1 morph series only. This suggests that categorical perception is tied to configural processing for familiar non-self-faces, but can be observed for self-faces during featural processing—consistent with evidence that self-face representations contain strong configural and featural components. Finally, categorical perception is not enhanced by the presence of the self-face relative to other familiar faces when upright, but shows a trend of being enhanced for self-faces when inverted, adding to the debate on the ways in which robustly represented faces can elicit categorical perception.","bibo:AuthorList":["Keyes, Helen"],"dc:date":"2012-11-22T11:58:48Z","doi":"10.1080/17470218.2011.636822","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Monocular accommodative facility was measured in nine myopes and nine emmetropes for distance and near. Subjective facility was recorded with automated flippers and objective measurements were simultaneously taken with a PowerRefractor. Accommodative facility training (a sequence of 5 min monocular right eye, 5 min monocular left eye, 5 min binocular) was given on three consecutive days and facility was re-assessed on the fifth day. The results showed that training improved the facility rate in both groups. The improvement in facility rates were linked to the time constants and peak velocity of accommodation. Some changes in amplitude seen in emmetropes indicate an improvement in facility rate at the expense of an accurate accommodation response.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allen, Peter M.","Charman, W.

The research project explores ways of enabling and encouraging quality student reading through the development of a University Reading Strategy, a set of best-practice ideas and guidelines drawn from discussions with academics, support staff and librarians.\n\nThe purpose of the paper is to review current issues around reading, particularly in the HE sector, in contemporary literature. The literature review is intended to provide a backdrop for the research project, giving benchmark information against which the developing Reading Strategy may be considered.\n\nThe literature review considers the UK Government’s current agenda for enhancing skills levels throughout the adult population. Economic and social challenges to traditional understandings of autonomous learning in HE are reflected in changes in learning and reading styles, and in the changing use of academic libraries. Alongside this the digital environment, within which most young people are comfortable and competent, continues to change reading habits and demand different information seeking skills. Public and academic libraries have to find ways to survive and grow in the new Web 2.0 world. Academic learning through new modes of reading has to be increasingly recognised. \n\nIn spite of these changes the printed book remains a key element in academic library services. Students continue to demand print texts and the textbook market appears to be thriving. This literature review suggests that traditional reading skills remain at the heart of university education, but that new modes and media for reading can be used creatively to enhance student learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Garfield, Diana"],"dc:date":"2012-07-11T08:49:33Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Barnett.

{"identifier":9597662,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Thesis"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Mature students in higher education: the career of a cohort of mature students in a public sector institution","bibo:abstract":"An attempt has been made to chart the changes and development seen in the careers of a cohort of mature students over a period of three years. In earlier chapters it was shown that mature students were highly motivated and felt themselves to be deeply committed to the degree course. This continued to be an important factor that ensured that all but one mature students finished the course. The almost universal lack of confidence observed in this cohort at the beginning of the course may have been caused by the perception that mature students were going to be taking a role usually associated with much younger people and one which might appear to be inappropriate for an adult. Moreover,this new role would have to be learned and there seemed to be no guide lines to help. Most of these mature students had never met somebody of their own age embarking on such an undertaking; they had no \"role-model\" to follow. The question of role identity had not been forseen as a problem by those mature students starting a first degree course designed primarily for s/l, although many were apprehensive about their situation as adults in an activity which was largely associated with late adolescence - a period which they had already gone through. In order to cope with this problem the majority of mature students found it was necessary to keep the two roles they were playing separate - their mature student role at CCAT and the \"adult\" role in the home or away from CCAT. This separation was more marked in those who had family responsiblities who made up the majority in this cohort. The single students of both sexes were among the younger mature students and identified more easily with the s/l and the role of student. A certain embarrassment felt by some mature students at an apparent incongruity of being a middle-aged student was emphasised by the reactions of family and friends. Male students were made aware by outside social pressures that a drop in income was a considerable burden to bear. The worry of being able to keep up mortgage repayments, for example, was an ever-present strain. The hope of enhanced career opportunities at the end of the course helped to sustain them. The categorisation of respondents into those who were critical of the course, those who were enthusiastic about it and those who adapted to the demands made upon them, was developed. These groupings remained almost unchanged throughout the three years but the varying attitudes used did not seem to make any difference in how the mature students coped with the problems that they found. The critics hoped that some of their ideas for improving the course, which would help s/l too, might be put into practice. It was their initiative that led to some lecturers providing a \"hand-out\" to those who attend a lecture so that note-taking at the time is unnecessary. The enthusiasts kept up the level of their enthusiasm and the majority of theme hope to go onto further studies e.g. post-graduate teacher training or a higher degree. The adapters, who tended to be among those who were less conforming to the demands of tutors, found that the added confidence gained from the course enabled them to continue to study in the way that suited them best personally, and reinforced their own self-reliance in their ability to cope with the course. All mature students found it necessary to be well organised to be able to cope with the dual role of student and life outside the college, but felt that the effort was worth while for the benefits they received from the course. The great majority would advise prospective students to be aware of the time needed to get the most advantages and enjoyment out of the time spent as students at CCAT, but to go ahead if the opportunity presented itself. Those who had the support and encouragement of their families acknowledged the difference this made. Some said that it would have been impossible for them to have managed without it. The founding of the Mature Student Club could be seen as an effort on the part of mature students to reinforce the perception of themselves as separate and different from s/l. The mutual support and sharing of similar problems found within this organisation helped them to find an acceptable role within the student body. Staff also welcomed the presence of mature students for their evident commitment and high motivation. It was acknowledged that mature students helped to maintain a higher academic standard within the degree course because of their presence. The fears expressed by the Careers Officer at CCAT about the problems caused by lack of mobility for women when looking for work after the course had finished was not in evidence within the cohort itself. All eventually expected to build on the experience gained by being a degree student, although most were realistic in acknowledging that it might take longer than if they were geographically more mobile. The advantages of having survived a hard three years of work were thought to far outweigh the disadvantages of a diminished income and a complete absence of any spare time. The longitudinal approach of this research enabled a number of changes to be observed. Gradually, as they successfully negotiated the academic requirements of the course - the first year examinations, continuous assessment and essay assignments - confidence built up. By the time of the final examinations mature students felt that they knew what was expected of them and were able to rise to the necessary academic standard. The fact that only one student \"dropped out\" appeared to speak well for the admission procedures adopted by the staff at CCAT when dealing with mature students, i.e. they had chosen those that they perceived could \"cope\" with the academic and social demands of the course. Alternatively, it may suggest that most mature students successfully adapted to what, at first, may have been perceived as a personally challenging experience but which became, especially in the first year, a threatening, institutional environment. Familiarity with the institution and their fellow students helped to remove some of the apprehension that was initially felt and criticism of school leavers fell away. The majority reported an awareness of the benefits arising from the mix of ages and backgrounds found on the course and felt that they had a useful contribution to make.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zeitlyn, Alice"],"dc:date":"2012-10-02T12:15:54Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":9597663,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"RNA biomarkers in colorectal cancer","bibo:abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) develops and progresses through a systematic selection for (epi) genetic alterations that drive the transformation from normal colon epithelium to adenocarcinoma. These changes affect both noncoding RNAs and mRNAs and so define the clinical behaviour of cancer cells within a distinctive host genetic and environmental context. Although earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment modalities have decreased mortality from CRC, prognostic stratification and adjuvant therapy selection after surgery remain dependent on broad descriptive classifications, opportune histological markers of poor prognosis and chemotherapy efficacy data derived from diverse CRC populations. Crucially, there is significant inter- and intra-individual variability in response to, and tolerance of, chemotherapy treatments. These limitations explain the small clinical benefit of new agents studied in contemporary phase III trials. Molecular assays have the potential to address these constraints and there has been intense interest in the identification of clinically relevant molecular biomarkers. These must be easy to obtain and quantify and ideally represent steps in well-understood carcinogenic pathways or host-response mechanisms. Although some biomarkers can provide broad prognostic information based on CRC subtype (e.g. MSI status) or can somewhat predict response to targeted therapies (e.g. KRAS), no RNA-based biomarkers have entered routine clinical practice. This is due, in part, to the genetic heterogeneity of both patients and CRC. In addition, serious underlying issues with regards to study design, poor technical protocols, inadequate quality controls and inappropriate data analysis prevent successful translation of research results. Consequently, the identification of clinically relevant panels of biomarkers will depend not just on further advances in our understanding of CRC biology, but will need to be coupled with appropriate study designs and more suitable, standardised and transparent techniques.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bustin, Stephen A.","Murphy, Jamie"],"dc:date":"2012-11-08T10:41:27Z","doi":"10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.10.003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":9597665,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The use of narratives to reveal the secret data of organisational life","bibo:abstract":"This paper considers the use of narrative exchanges in the form of letters and conversations as a legitimate research method when collecting “secret data” within organisational settings. It refers to narrative exchanges the authors’ undertook over a three‑month period, regarding their different perspectives on their University Staff Appraisal System. It explores personal tensions and anxieties that reside within the “secret data” of organisational life. It also reveals a concern regarding “professional commitments” with colleagues and the “managerial” edicts that dominate their work environment. From a “critical management” perspective, the paper initially provides an overview of the postmodern position and its impact upon organisational power relationships and knowledge, as individuals strive to attain and gain their authentic, personal voice within the domination of modernistic organisations. It then explains the methodological approach used for the narrative exchanges and describes the context and relationship of the two colleagues. Commencing from a discussion of organisational policy and postmodernist critiques the conversations increasingly developed into a dialogical meditation on the relationship between “self” and “other”. These narratives revealed, through their autographical, autobiographical and at times surreal discourses, messages that are often absent from conventional research data. The paper concludes with a perspective regarding critical management in which individual values, dignity, honesty and respect are upheld. Thus, narrative exchanges of this kind allow dialogical conversations in which statements are agreed, accepted, challenged or sometimes synthesised to be used as a means to explore and collect legitimate “secret data” of organisational life within an environment that respects the ethical and value systems of the participants engaged in narrative exchanges.","bibo:AuthorList":["Armitage, Andrew M.D.","Thornton, Alan"],"dc:date":"2012-11-22T12:05:43Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":9597666,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Critical pedagogy and learning to dialogue: towards reflexive practice for financial management and accounting education","bibo:abstract":"Mainstream accounting historians study accounting in terms of its progressive development of instrumental techniques and practices, this being counterpoised to critical accounting that sees the world as\nsocially constructed, and intrinsically linked to organisational, social\nand political contexts. This is exemplified by the notion of the\n“governable person”, and how standard costing and budgeting are part\nof the complex social, and organisational management practices that\nhave developed to regulate individual action in the name of economic\nefficiency. Furthermore, it has been suggested that little critical\nanalysis has been provided of the specific ways in which power may\noperate through accounting education or the forms that a more radical\neducation might take in the reproduction of social structures, and the\nmaintenance of forms of subordination. In responding to these\nconcerns, this paper will advance a response to be found within a\nFreirean critical pedagogy that espouses emancipatory and authentic\neducational practices underpinned by the dialogical process, these\nbeing central to reflective and reflexive learning environments. Tales\nfrom the field are then offered as insights as to how critical pedagogy, dialogue, and the reflexive turn are articulated within classroom\nsettings in order to create empowering, and emancipatory learning\nenvironments before offering some implications for practice. It\nconcludes that critical pedagogy, dialogue, and the reflexive turn are\ncentral to the pursuit of individual liberty and freedom in the\neducation process requiring educators to have a heightened awareness\nof reflective and reflexive pedagogical practices, which can only\nemerge if learning environments are conducted through the dialogical\nprocess, which supports human freedom, and an ethics of respect.","bibo:AuthorList":["Armitage, Andrew M.D."],"dc:date":"2012-11-22T11:49:35Z","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Armitage.

Whereas mainstream accounting historians study accounting history in terms of\nthe progressive development of modern techniques and practices, a Foucauldian analysis challenges the\nvery notion of its historical progress. Hopwood,  in his comments concerning\nthe archaeology of accounting systems has questioned the traditional notion of its historical progress\nshowing how research into its practices has become ‘what it is not’. Miller and O’Leary have also\ndiscussed the ‘governable person’, showing how standard costing and budgeting are part of the complex\nsocial and organisational management practices that have developed to regulate individual action in the\nname of economic efficiency. Further, the public finance and accountancy management\nprofessions have not adopted what might be termed a “critical stance” towards its practices, being trapped\nwithin a modernist target setting culture. As such, I will discuss\nthe context in which financial management and accountancy operates and the response found within a\ncritical pedagogy that espouses emancipatory and authentic educational practices underpinned by the\ndialogical process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Armitage, Andrew M.D."],"dc:date":"2012-11-22T11:45:11Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":9597668,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The rapid structured literature review as a research strategy","bibo:abstract":"A diversity of sources of literature encompassed by the management disciplines appears to result in a growing need for a systematic methodology to map the territory of management theory. As such, when scoping out a study, structured literature review (SLR) can be considered as a means by which any critical, central literature might be considered. However, there is little guidance, or evidence, of this being undertaken for the purposes of small scale projects such as undergraduate or masters’ dissertations. This paper reports four case studies of master’s degree students following management programmes of undertaking a structured literature review (SLR) and the issues and problems they had to encounter during their journey. The findings from the case studies suggest that in terms of time to complete and the volume of output required in terms of word count, Tranfield, et al’s approach to SLRs, whilst suited to doctoral level research is not appropriate generally when dealing with undergraduate and masters research projects. Therefore, this paper provides accounts of the experiences of four students who undertook SLR for their undergraduate or master’s degree dissertation. The paper identifies that these students had to deal with a new set of conceptual problems relating to this “unorthodox” approach to a postgraduate research dissertation in coming to terms with new paradigms of enquiry that are not normally taught as part of a traditional research methods course. This was despite gaining a greater depth of insight into the subject area through a more rigorous and structured manner. The paper presents alternative remedies by way of a rapid structured literature review (RSLR) model. This would appear to be more appropriate to the conducting of small scale literature based research projects when used with undergraduate and master’s degree students than SLR identified for other research activities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Armitage, Andrew M.D.","Keeble-Ramsay, Diane"],"dc:date":"2012-11-29T09:48:50Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These constructs, relating to the structure of networks, the nature of the relationships or ties within them, the content of these ties, the context of the network overall, and the degree to which a network is purposive or goal-directed, are found to have relevance in shaping strategy and measuring performance for social enterprise networks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brady, Andrew","Haugh, Helen"],"dc:date":"2012-11-27T10:00:56Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":9597670,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The Screaming Pope: imagery and leadership in two paintings of the Pope Innocent X","bibo:abstract":"The image of authoritarian figures and leaders inspired many of Francis Bacon’s paintings. Among these, his interpretation of the Portrait of Pope Innocent X (1650) by Velázquez represents an exemplary way of revealing the complex dilemmas incorporated within a leader. However, whereas in Velázquez’s portrait the Pope appeared regal, serene and inquisitive, Bacon’s Study after Velázquez’s Portrait of Pope Innocent X (1953) seems to explore the isolation conferred by his authority. The obsession of Bacon with this painting may suggest a wider challenge to contemporary organizational mythology — top managers, businessmen, politicians, CEOs, bankers, etc. — experiencing a sort of leadership crisis, in a moment when their public image is being questioned and their social status threatened. Is it, then, possible to visualize how our contemporary images of power may become transfigured, challenged and contorted? The dialogue between these two representations of Innocent X inspires questions about the representation and re-interpretation of authority and leadership and it aims at responding the question of What do images of leaders as depicted by portraiture contribute to our understanding of leading and leadership? This paper follows the analytical framework proposed by Guthey and Jackson concerning a ‘visual genealogy’ of images of leaders. The notion of establishing a ‘genealogy’ of representations of leadership draws upon the work of Michel Foucault, concerning the ways through which Western culture creates subjects and, most specifically, how images of leadership are created through portraiture and art. The interest in the Pope acknowledges the significance of his figure as leader of the Catholic Church, one of the most important institutions in European history; here, however, the intention is to establish a dialogue between Bacon’s view on leadership in the figure of Innocent X, on the one hand, and on the other the original portrait by Velázquez, both seen in the context of contemporary discussions about leadership and charisma. Here, portraiture is approached as an aesthetic expression that can be used as a means of enquiring into certain aspects of leadership. Both perceptions coincided in their interpretation of leadership as focused on the charismatic individual; yet each of these two representations evidences a rupture, a questioning of this view. Velázquez, in a troppo vero (too real) depiction of the Pope, shows an efficient and cruel leader while offering his personal interpretation of the politics of his time. Bacon’s interpretation goes further, by representing a powerful yet isolated leader, whose excessive individuality has produced a cage in which he remains trapped. Separated from his subjects, this view resembles the excessive attention that the individual is given when understanding leadership and its potential problems. This paper adds to the exploration of aesthetic expressions as a means of enquiring into organizational and social issues, for example, the case of leadership. It evidences the potentialities of considering specific artistic expressions, such as portraiture, as heuristic devices towards understanding some of the processes through which leadership is socially constructed, and the mechanisms promoting one notion or another of leadership in different historical periods.","bibo:AuthorList":["Acevedo, Beatriz"],"dc:date":"2012-11-27T10:14:05Z","doi":"10.1177/1742715010386859","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It does so by exploring symbolic readings of organisations’ relations with drugs and drug‐taking. Our focus is recent coverage of, and organisational responses to, the UK tabloid media’s exposé of fashion supermodel Kate Moss’s alleged cocaine use. We consider that the celebrity endorsement in this particular case highlights the ambiguities created by the symbolic associations between the organisation and the ‘image’ projected by the celebrity. Overall, we use this case to explore symbolic relationships between drugs, sex, femininity and organisation. Through highlighting these connections, we question further the rationality of organisational responses to employee drug use and, utilising Derrida’s extension of Plato’s notion of the pharmakon, consider whether workforce drug testing might be fruitfully seen as a symbolic mechanism for scapegoating and sacrifice in order to protect the organisation’s (masculine) moral order.","bibo:AuthorList":["Acevedo, Beatriz","Warren, Samantha","Wray‐Bliss, Edward"],"dc:date":"2012-11-27T10:17:15Z","doi":"10.1080/14759550903250759","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Following a tradition stemming from the artistic movements of the twentieth century, Salcedo has been acknowledged as one of the most intriguing and original artists in her exploration of public tragedy, the delicate issue of human rights and the trace of violence in those who are left behind. Salcedo’s undertaking does not address those tangible manifestations of evil; instead, her work goes beyond the surface, inviting the spectator to a journey inside … into memories and feelings, into fears and intimate spaces. In this article, I offer a discussion regarding places, intersections and motivations in Salcedo’s oeuvre and suggest some echoes between certain philosophical foundations of her work in relation to human rights in the case of Colombia. This article addresses the invitation for this Special Issue on Arts and Human Rights, focusing on the case of Colombia, where a systematic and ongoing crisis has damaged fundamental human rights for those affected by the civil conflict.

A UK-based review","bibo:abstract":"This paper focuses on the role of food tourism in delivering sustainability agendas by examining how the agriculture and tourism sectors have struggled to realise measurable successes because of constraints, conflicting ambitions and low levels of social capital. It focuses on the United Kingdom, which has tasked regional development agencies to adopt food tourism as a means to grow local economies, create jobs and improve natural resources and diversify. In 2009/10, 16 interviews and six workshops were conducted with stakeholders to gauge industry challenges and needs in implementing food tourism. Based on qualitative findings, a model was developed which maps five emergent themes (knowledge exchange, the supply chain, fear of change, regionalisation and marketing) alongside five sustainability principles (strong and just society, good governance, sustainable economy, working within environmental limits and using sound science responsibly). The paper argues that if food tourism is to deliver its purported sustainable benefits, the policy environment must cultivate significant social capital through the cooperation of different industries with varying needs, motivations and challenges through joint marketing schemes, more localised distribution channels and enhanced policy engagement. Scotland and Wales are more successful than England, but overall food and tourism are not yet in effective partnership.","bibo:AuthorList":["Everett, Sally","Slocum, Susan L."],"dc:date":"2012-12-13T10:14:04Z","doi":"10.1080/09669582.2012.741601","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The findings suggest that the traditional authority enjoyed by external financial auditors is being, and will be, increasingly challenged by IT audit specialists. The role of the professional bodies, responsible for the education and training of financial audit professionals, in particular, is highlighted as key to the outcome if they are to fend off challenges in this growing arena and retain jurisdictional control.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kotb, Amr","Roberts, Clare","Sian, S."],"dc:date":"2012-12-04T10:52:01Z","doi":"10.1016/j.cpa.2012.03.003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The interviewees were a sub-sample of respondents (n \u003d 188) who completed a paper-based questionnaire on similar topics, who were recruited through a poster placed in a family planning clinic, web-based advertisements on workplace and university websites, and through direct approaches to social groups. The bodily metaphors used when discussing contraception were analyzed using an interpretative phenomenological analytical approach facilitated by Atlas.ti software. The dominant bodily metaphor was mechanistic (i.e.,\"body as machine\"). A subordinate but influential bodily metaphor was the \"natural\" body, which had connotations of connection to nature and a quasi-sacred bodily order. Interviewees drew upon this \"natural\" metaphorical image in the context of discussing their anxieties about hormonal contraception. Drawing upon a \"natural,\" non-mechanistic body image in the context of contraceptive decision-making contributed to reluctance to use a hormonal form of contraception. This research suggests that clinicians could improve communication and advice about contraception by recognizing that some users may draw upon non-mechanistic body imagery.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walker, Susan H."],"dc:date":"2012-12-13T09:50:51Z","doi":"10.1080/03630242.2012.728190","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Yet, by the 1980s, animals had all but disappeared from human geography. Reanimated geographies of animals emerged on the back of newer cultural geographies and their engagement with post-structuralism, but also out of political–economic approaches to food and agriculture, and a wider environmental and ethical focus, and have moved into newer areas that problematize nature/culture dualisms – the historical and cultural separations of humans from animals – and seek to bring animals into a reconstructed, more-than-human geography which acknowledges wider ranges of actors in the making of everyday social life.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilbert, Chris"],"dc:date":"2012-12-06T09:45:55Z","doi":"10.1016/B978-008044910-4.00557-5","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A reform of teaching practices within economics needs to be pre-requisited on intellectual diversity and a curriculum that is characterised by both plurality and reflexive, critical skills. As an orientation, pluralism is essential for becoming a critical and reflexive thinker. This paper argues that although plurality can be perceived as a first step in achieving pluralism in economics, economists – both mainstream and heterodox – need to go beyond a plurality of perspectives in order to concentrate on developing critical and reflexive skills amongst their students.","bibo:AuthorList":["Negru, Ioana"],"dc:date":"2012-12-13T09:52:03Z","doi":"10.1504/IJPEE.2010.034683","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Green economics has on its agenda a more integrated approach of the economy, the environment and the social. As such, its approach is inherently interdisciplinary. And the concern with the environment calls on a way of relating to the latter in which care, as an orientation, a task and way of acting all play a crucial part. This paper examines the theorising of care in economics, and undertakes to demonstrate that the question addresses categories underpinned by strict economic as well as \u0027non-economic\u0027 presuppositions about the world we live in. By taking care of labour as our category of analysis, and taking as our vantage point the two way relationship between material and non-material well-being, the paper proceeds to show how the various disciplines come together in a fully fledged theory of care in economics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bigo, Vinca","Negru, Ioana"],"dc:date":"2012-12-13T09:53:52Z","doi":"10.1504/IJGE.2011.042552","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is an approach that recognizes that long-term ecosystem behavior involves continual change at small and large spatial and temporal scales. There are a number of situations in which it is appropriate to adopt an open-ended approach to restoration including: in remote and large areas; where ecological limiting factors will be changed by future climates; where antecedent conditions cannot be replicated; where there are novel starting points for restoration; where restoration relies strongly on processes outside the restoration area; in inherently dynamic systems; where costs are high and where the public demands ‘wildness’. Where this approach is adopted managers need to explain the project and deal with public expectations and public risk. Monitoring biotic and abiotic components of the project are very important as an open-ended approach does not equate to ‘abandon and ignore it’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hughes, Francine M.R.","Adams, William M.","Stroh, Peter A."],"dc:date":"2013-01-03T11:24:51Z","doi":"10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00874.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Participants were classified as normal, Meares-Irlen sensitive, and borderline sensitive. Reading speed was measured with and without coloured overlays, using the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test and the change in speed was calculated. Participants classified as normal did not show any significant benefit from reading with an overlay. In contrast, a significant reading advantage was found for the borderline and Meares-Irlen participants. Current symptom rating was found to be a significant predictor of the change in reading speed, however the previous symptom rating was not found to be a reliable predictor.

In juxtaposition, and immanent, are multiple requirements for the self to be harmed, in various ways, for the purposes of achieving organizational progress. This post‐structuralist composition explores how these requirements are inscribed, and desired, in different ways during ontotheological and neo‐primitive processes of sacrifice, neomasochism, simulacra, exclusion, and theodicy. These processes permit the possibility that the harming of the self can be justified (utility/include) and also discounted (diminish/exclude). It is argued, that relations of self and harm constantly arise, and change, during non‐integratable affects and events of radical alteration; namely where self questioning (loss of self) and questioning of self (identity) occur. However, it is argued, neo‐primitive organizing constantly refuses ethical responsiveness to self harm, through the inscriptive superimposition of exchange relations of lack, debt and guilt.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gray, Lloyd"],"dc:date":"2012-12-20T10:34:47Z","doi":"10.1080/14759550802079291","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

HEIs need to enhance the perception and relevance of entrepreneurship education, so students and staff recognise the value of its combination of innovation, creativity, collaboration and risk-taking skills to a wide range of disciplines\u0027. This paper focuses on a ground breaking programme specifically designed to address these criticisms of the way in which enterprise and entrepreneurship is taught in universities. There are a huge number of programmes on offer across within European Higher Education with the words \u0027enterprise\u0027 and \u0027entrepreneurship\u0027 in the title, but what makes the BA (Hons) Enterprise and Entrepreneurial Management unique is the close involvement of entrepreneurs right from the outset, including course design, module content and delivery. This is achieved through an \u0027entrepreneur in residence\u0027 network, with Walter Herriot, Managing Director of St John\u0027s Innovation Centre, Cambridge, one of the world\u0027s leading incubation centres, as Director. This enables leading entrepreneurs to be embedded in fabric of the programme through playing a very active role in the continued development of the curriculum, content, and delivery of the pathway. Additionally, each student is allocated an entrepreneur as mentor for the duration of the three year programme. This paper firstly explores the key issues raised by the policy community and others calling into question the appropriateness of the way in which enterprise and entrepreneurship is taught. It then looks at the way in which UK universities are responding to these comments.

The paper seeks to argue that though some conceptualization of virtual presence has been made in the literature, this only took account of one\u0027s presence among a community of “known” others. Increasingly, however, in blogging and other online communities, users do not necessarily know the “others” but they nevertheless interact with them and develop friendships and lasting relationships. This stresses the multidimensional character of the study; one which sees presence as the core topic by considering different perspectives to it. An exploratory case study is conducted with a backpackers\u0027 blogging site, its members and audience; a setting that was considered suitable for finding answers to the research questions. The data are analysed qualitatively following a thematic analysis approach. It was found that the invisible and unknown audience has an important role to play in backpackers\u0027 presence online. In particular, the study highlights the role played by the audience in shaping the blogging experience and the sense of presence that this experience develops.","bibo:AuthorList":["Panteli, Niki","Yan, Lin","Chamakiotis, Petros"],"dc:date":"2013-01-14T09:19:04Z","doi":"10.1108/09593841111182241","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In the months that followed the option of revolution also seemed to be barred with eight men, who were convicted of High Treason for plotting rebellion, being executed in front of massive crowds in London, Glasgow and Stirling. With these killings, the last for High Treason for almost 100 years, the British government advertised to the public that radical organisations were weak, disorganised, and that any rebellion would be ruthlessly crushed. With the failure of the final radical rallying point that was the Queen Caroline affair, ‘a curious period of relative stasis followed’ as Marilyn Butler asserts. Radical ideas now had to be disseminated through new routes, one of the most effective of which was to attack the established church and its more notorious members. \n\nThe Reverend Charles Ethelston was a central figure at Peterloo.  He was the clerical magistrate who was said to have read the Riot Act, sent in the troops, and signed the warrant for the arrests. After the event he was the subject of attacks by a range of writers, poets, and artists, including: Samuel Bamford, William Benbow, George Cruikshank, William Hone, Percy Shelley, and a number of anonymous squib writers. This paper will explore these reactions to the clerical magistrate and how these attacks widened to include the established church and figures such as William Hay and the Archbishop of Clogher, Percy Jocelyn.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gardner, John"],"dc:date":"2013-01-17T12:32:13Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The data were gathered as part of the Athens Area Study conducted by the University of Piraeus, University of Central Greece, and Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences. \n\nGay employees were found to be less satisfied according to all job satisfaction measures. Affect theory proposes that the extent to which one values a given facet of work moderates how dissatisfied one becomes when one\u0027s expectations are not met. Furthermore, the data enable us to estimate that gay employees’ job satisfaction is not associated more (as compared with heterosexuals’ job satisfaction) with adverse mental health symptoms. This finding is crucial given the rising interest between job satisfaction and life satisfaction. Finally, wage gaps against gay employees are found after accounting for basic asymmetries. Interestingly, however, the wage gaps grow for very dissatisfied employees and shrink for very satisfied employees. \n\nAs long as the general patterns in Greece suggest that homosexual employees face labor market discrimination, gay employees will report being less satisfied at work. Actually, in this study, job satisfaction is associated with wage inequality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Drydakis, Nick"],"dc:date":"2013-01-17T12:24:05Z","doi":"10.1108/01437721211280371","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Unemployment and even starvation were a part of life for the 95% of people in Britain who had no access to political representation. After the massacre at St. Peter’s Fields in Manchester in August 1819, when troops trampled their way through an unarmed crowd, it seemed that the opportunity to gain representation through peaceful protest had failed. The public executions of eight men for High Treason in 1820 also showed that any revolt would be ruthlessly crushed. The third avenue to representation, patronage from a person in a position to change the government, appeared when Caroline of Brunswick, the estranged wife of the Prince Regent, returned to Britain to claim her rights as queen after the death of her father-in-law George III. The impact of Caroline’s return seemed to threaten the Government itself, and because of this it produced strange alliances, when radicals, and even republicans like Percy Shelley, appeared to support a queen. However the strangest alliance is probably the relationship between the rabble-rousing proprietor of the Political Register, William Cobbett, and Queen Caroline. That the son of a small Sussex farmer\ncould become the queen’s address writer, and at the same time subvert her cause to his own radical agenda is something that had never occurred before\nthis political moment. This paper will explore the relationship between Caroline and Cobbett, and in doing so will examine an extreme example of the\ninteraction between ‘high’ and ‘low’ literature.\nRésumé La fin de la guerre avec la France en 1815 a occasionné une grave récession en Grande-Bretagne eu égard à l’annulation des commandes de\nmatériels de guerre et la démobilisation de 200 000 militaires qui se sont ainsi retrouvés le chemin du marché du travail. Chômage et famine étaient le lot quotidien pour les 95 % de personnes en Grande-Bretagne, qui n\u0027avaient pas\naccès à la représentation politique. Après le massacre de champs de St. Peter à Manchester en août 1819, lorsque les troupes piétinaient sur leur chemin une foule sans armes, il semblait que la possibilité d\u0027acquérir la représentation\npar le biais de manifestations pacifiques ait échoué. Les exécutions publiques de huit hommes pour haute trahison en 1820 ont également montré que toute révolte pourrait être impitoyablement écrasée. La troisième avenue de représentation, le patronage d\u0027une personne en mesure de changer le\ngouvernement, est apparue quand Caroline de Brunswick, l\u0027épouse du Prince Régent, retourna en Grande-Bretagne pour revendiquer ses droits en tant que Caroline and Cobbett\nJohn Gardner, Ph.D. Cambridge, UK\n130\nReine après la mort de son beau-père George III.

Educated Muslim women appear to have a great deal of expression, interest and passion to offer the process. The study investigates the new emerging social sub group of professional Muslim women in Sierra Leone society and explores their views and experiences of identifying and attempting to overcome the burdens of patriarchy, oppression and exploitation perpetrated by religious, social and cultural beliefs. The research and thesis consider in what ways these women and their views ‘fit’ in or challenge society and their perceptions of the potential they have as models to impact on the lives of Sierra Leonean Muslim women nationwide.\nUsing feminist influenced research practices in order to focus on the stories and voices of these women, the study contributes to the growth of knowledge related to the emergent changing roles and perceptions of Muslim women in present day Sierra Leone. This qualitative and interdisciplinary research develops a critical focus and deliberately combines literary sources in an informative context, with feminist research methods of interviews and focus groups on issues of gender equality and empowerment. Through the interviews and focus group discussions conducted, the research portrays the perceptions of the emerging social sub group of professional Muslim women, a cross section of grass-root Muslim women and a selection of male Muslims regarding empowerment, knowledge, culture, independence and oppression. These are also illustrated as the ways the participants embrace the concept of feminism and adapt it by drawing on their Sierra Leonean, Islamic, cultural and social traditions.\nThe research examines the various ideologies that stifle the growth of Sierra Leonean Muslim women from their perspective and it analyses the strategies used by the professional women to tackle the oppressive and repressive customs and stand up against patriarchy. It was discovered through the findings that the research gives an insight into the determination and the conviction of professional Muslim women in advocating for social change and in making their voices heard. As an outcome, it is evidenced that this emerging social sub group of Muslim women appear to be inspiring self-development moves and changes not only among the uneducated grass-root majority, but in the fold of their Muslim men-folk, resulting in a visible impact of self development and self empowerment among Sierra Leonean Muslim women.","bibo:AuthorList":["Taqi, Fatmatta, B."],"dc:date":"2013-01-24T10:28:58Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

One reason for this neglect might be the misperception of testimonial literature as predominantly focussed on contemporary themes, but this categorization does not consider hybrid forms such as the testimonial novel, which explicitly combines explorations of the past and the present, nor does it address the contemporary relevance of Spanish colonialism for neo-colonial patterns in contemporary Latin American society, economy and politics. However, in its unique link to the subversive potential of traditional chronicles, and in its integration of new concepts of historiographic metafiction, the new testimonial literature provides a very interesting ground for further explorations of literary portrayals of the Conquest, and Belli’s La mujer habitada from 1988 plays in our understanding a significant role as one of the hybrid forms of testimonial narrative that lead to a paradigmatic change in the genre, usually dated half a decade later. This study will investigate Belli’s key work in the context of her earlier poems and the development of the New Historical Novel in order to assess how La mujer habitada dissolves the official image of a heroic humanist Conquest by body metaphors closely connected to indigenous cosmology. While there is clear evidence of meta-reflection and auto-criticism in her work, this essay argues that Belli does not always manage to maintain the same critical distance towards indigenist patterns of thought.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rings, Guido"],"dc:date":"2013-02-04T10:19:21Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The results of the experiment to date suggests that this approach to feedback can have a positive effect on student performance as they make the transition from formative assignment to summative examination but that the main beneficiaries of that performance improvement are students who did well in the assignment rather that students who had average or poor performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adcroft, Andy","Willis, Robert"],"dc:date":"2013-02-04T16:07:36Z","doi":"10.1080/02602938.2012.714740","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There were three main objectives of this study: firstly, to investigate the spread and distribution of H. axyridis in Europe from the start of the invasion process; secondly, to study its ecology in Great Britain; and thirdly, to examine its effects on native ladybirds in Britain. \nIn Europe, collaborations with a network of scientists allowed the collation of H. axyridis occurrence data from across the continent.  In Great Britain, a web-based public survey (www.harlequin-survey.org) was used, leading to the receipt of over 10,000 verified records of H. axyridis between 2004 and 2008.  National land cover data enabled the habitats used by H. axyridis to be identified across Great Britain.  These datasets were analysed in order to study the spread and ecology of H. axyridis in Europe and Britain.  Fieldwork over a three year period (2006 to 2008) was carried out to examine changes in ladybird species assemblages during the invasion phase of H. axyridis in eastern England.  Laboratory work was conducted to detect intraguild predation by H. axyridis, through PCR analyses of gut contents of field-collected ladybirds.\nIn Europe, H. axyridis has spread since 2001 at the rate of approximately 200km yr-1.  It has become established in at least 23 European countries.  The established range extends from Norway in the north to southern France in the south, and from Ukraine in the east to Great Britain in the west.  In the first five years of establishment H. axyridis spread north through Britain at the rate of 105km yr-1 and west at the rate of 145km yr-1.  Evidence of the production of two generations per year was found, giving H. axyridis an advantage over most native ladybirds in Britain.  Although H. axyridis was very common in urban habitats, it increasingly used semi-natural habitats.  In addition, whilst the species was most common on deciduous trees, it was increasingly found on herbaceous plants.  Aceraceae, Rosaceae and Malvaceae were the dominant plant families used by H. axyridis, especially for breeding.  In eastern England H. axyridis increased from 0.1% to 40% of total ladybirds in three years, whilst native aphidophagous ladybirds declined from 84% to 41% of total ladybirds in the same period.  Three species in particular experienced declines: Adalia 2-punctata, Coccinella 7-punctata and Propylea 14-punctata.  Harmonia axyridis was the most abundant species by the end of the study.  Detection of intraguild predation by one coccinellid on another, in the field in Europe, was shown for the first time using PCR techniques: A. 2-punctata DNA was detected in the gut of one of 112 field-collected H. axyridis.\nHarmonia axyridis has spread very quickly since 2001 and has become one of the most widely distributed coccinellids in Europe.  Populations of native aphidophagous ladybirds were negatively affected by the arrival of H. axyridis, partly through intraguild predation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Peter M.J."],"dc:date":"2013-02-11T10:40:56Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Das mag auf die Marginalisierung dieses Themas im spanischen Literaturkanon zurückzuführen sein, der sich auch weiterhin mehr mit dem unmittelbaren Erbe des Faschismus beschäftigt. Zu legitimieren ist eine solche Forschungslücke aber weder mit Blick auf die ausführliche Diskussion im neueren und neuesten Abenteuerroman – etwa bei Hernández (1992, 1995), Muñoz (2002), Pimentel (2003) und Asensi (2003), noch erscheint sie im Interesse einer strukturell fundierten Vergangenheitsbewältigung, denn Kontinuitäten und Brüche nationaler Identitätskonstruktion spiegeln sich in ehemaligen Kolonialmächten wie Spanien insbesondere auch in der Darstellung der Kolonialzeit. Matilde Asensis El origen perdido liefert als hyperrealistischer Bestseller einer derzeit sehr erfolgreichen Autorin eine ausgezeichnete Grundlage zur Hinterfragung der Geschichtsbilder im spanischen Abenteuerroman. Unter Berücksichtigung der dortigen Intertextualität, zu deren Erarbeitung auf quijoteske Grundmuster, den sprachpolitischen Paradigmenwechsel von Lapesa zu Eco und neuere Theorien zum kulturellen Gedächtnis zurückgegriffen wird, ist auf eine weitgehende Dekonstruktion kolonialer Hegemonialvorstellungen zu verweisen. Insbesondere werden darauf aufbauende hierarchisch fixierte eurozentrische Kultur- und Gendervorstellungen mittels transkultureller Konzepte aufgelöst, der Roman stabilisiert allerdings auch Kernaspekte exotischer Objektifizierung und Romantisierung, die Asensi aus indigenistischen Diskursen entliehen haben dürfte.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rings, Guido"],"dc:date":"2013-02-19T11:56:17Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":9636582,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Die Konquista als Karneval. Eroberte Eroberer in Armas Marcelos Las naves quemadas","bibo:abstract":"Während zu der Aufarbeitung von Konquista und Kolonialzeit im lateinamerikanischen Roman mittlerweile relativ viele Studien vorliegen, bleibt ihre Behandlung im neueren, mitunter als postkolonial oder postmodern etikettierten spanischen Roman weitestgehend unbeachtet. Das mag auf die Marginalisierung dieses Themas in den Werken der zum zeitgenössischen Literaturkanon gehörenden spanischen Schriftsteller zurückzuführen sein, die in ihrem unbeirrten Fokus auf das Erbe des Franquismo die Relevanz der Kolonialzeit für eine postfranquistische spanische Identitätssuche zu vernachlässigen tendieren. Mit Blick auf die zahlreichen Aufarbeitungsversuche im neueren und neuesten spanischen Roman, so etwa bei Juan José Armas Marcelo (1982), Ramón Hernández (1992, 1995), José Luis Muñoz (2002) und Matilde Asensi (2003), erscheint jedoch dringender Bedarf für eine Annäherung an spanische Perspektiven. Armas Marcelos Las naves quemadas bietet wegen der im Rahmen dieses literarischen Entwicklung frühen und in vieler Hinsicht vorbildhaften Behandlung der Thematik eine gute Grundlage hierzu. Eine Verbindung von Thesen aus seiner Essayistik mit dem Ansatz der bachtinschen Literaturtheorie führt zu der Arbeitshypothese, dass der Roman das offizielle humanistisch geprägte Konquistabild mittels karnevalesker Dekonstruktionsstrategien auflöst. Die literarische Perspektive inszeniert Eroberer, die zur Verbreitung renaissantistischer Ideale unfähig erscheinen und im Rahmen unterschiedlichster Obsessionen nicht nur das weiblich imaginierte Andere der neuen Welt brutal unterdrücken, sondern zugleich immer auch ihre eigene Erniedrigung, Marginalisierung und Eliminierung vorbereiten. Bei aller Dekonstruktion kolonialer Perspektivik und gleichzeitig auffallender Distanz zu indigenen Interpretationsansätzen vermag sich allerdings auch Armas Marcelo nicht völlig von neokolonialen Denkmustern zu lösen.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rings, Guido"],"dc:date":"2013-02-19T11:52:47Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It focuses particularly on the successful accomplishment of communication, rather than on failed or mis-communication, and identifies the strategies employed to achieve it. The paper shows that disparate linguistic skills need not impede communication provided that participants are equipped with adequate strategic competence. It further considers what attributes of this particular group of lingua franca users might have contributed to the development of this communicative competence and what implications this might have for the educational needs of lingua franca users in general.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ife, Anne"],"dc:date":"2013-02-19T11:43:54Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Originating from a wave of immigration during the 1970s, a considerable part of the community now consists of a second, UK-born generation. This explorative study seeks to address, first, the extent of the intergenerational language shift from Bangla to English, and second, the patterns in Ethnolinguistic Vitality (EV) perceptions amongst a group of educated second-generation Bangladeshis. This study is located within the theoretical framework of EV. A questionnaire was used to elicit information on language usage patterns and perceptions of EV. The results suggest a strong shift from a very Bangla-centric first generation to a second generation that shows strong preferences for the use of English across all communicative domains. Bangla language maintenance seems to play a limited role even in the home/family domain – a domain that has traditionally been seen as a stronghold of minority community languages. This raises issues with regard to heritage language transmission from the second to the third generation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rasinger, Sebastian M."],"dc:date":"2013-02-21T14:32:27Z","doi":"10.1080/01434632.2012.707202","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Academic staff experienced in teaching by ODL considered this to be a gap in students’ educational experience and, furthermore, that opportunities for early engagement of students in their online course could be enhanced. The aim of this paper is to explain the rationale for an online induction, to outline the activities undertaken by students and staff and to consider whether online induction is an effective strategy for online learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Winnard, Yvette","Elliott, Vicki"],"dc:date":"2013-02-26T15:19:47Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":9636617,"ep:Repository":6,"dc:type":["Conference Paper"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Four visions of judgement","bibo:abstract":"The notion that stories are not owned but merely exist to be used whatever way the author wishes to is well illustrated by Southey’s ‘A Vision of Judgment’, now little read compared to Byron’s dominant counter-blast.  William Hone’s response to both of these poems, ‘A New Vision of Judgement’, printed along with a corresponding cut by George Cruikshank, connects these two versions and radicalises them. \n\nHone raises, with particular directness, the question of who can properly claim ownership of a particular narrative? Who owns a nursery rhyme such as The House that Jack Built, or an expensively published poem such as Don Juan, or a laureate poem such as A Vision of Judgement, or the story of the Peterloo massacre or the Bible? Hone takes these circulating texts and claims each of them in the name of his own radical agenda. In an age of print culture, representations are not owned, they are only used, and anyone with access to print has the power to use them in any way they will.\n\nIn this paper I will examine the relationship between these three men, and their circle, through their ‘Visions’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gardner, John"],"dc:date":"2013-02-28T11:39:14Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
