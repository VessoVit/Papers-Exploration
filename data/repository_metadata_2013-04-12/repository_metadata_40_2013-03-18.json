Furthermore, some records are susceptible to improper alterations that make them untrustworthy.  Trusted Digital Repositories (TDRs) and Trustworthy Digital Objects (TDOs) seem to be the only broadly applicable digital preservation methodologies proposed.  We argue that the TDR approach has shortfalls as a method for long-term digital preservation of sensitive information.  Comparison of TDR and TDO methodologies suggests differentiating near-term preservation measures from what is needed for the long term.\n  \nTDO methodology addresses these needs, providing for making digital documents durably intelligible.  It uses EDP standards for a few file formats and XML structures for text documents.  For other information formats, intelligibility is assured by using a virtual computer.  To protect sensitive information—content whose inappropriate alteration might mislead its readers, the integrity and authenticity of each TDO is made testable by embedded public-key cryptographic message digests and signatures.  Key authenticity is protected recursively in a social hierarchy.  The proper focus for long-term preservation technology is signed packages that each combine a record collection with its metadata and that also bind context—Trustworthy Digital Objects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gladney, Dr. Henry M."],"dc:date":"2009-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15587,"sim:weight":0.833446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15654,"sim:weight":0.807221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929316,"sim:weight":0.792833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929315,"sim:weight":0.78598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15591,"sim:weight":0.780877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15629,"sim:weight":0.77519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15630,"sim:weight":0.771183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15655,"sim:weight":0.741269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929313,"sim:weight":0.7015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15649,"sim:weight":0.671931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15656,"sim:weight":0.61369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2809705,"sim:weight":0.471218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931117,"sim:weight":0.465238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.454215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2809706,"sim:weight":0.447712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6189606,"sim:weight":0.425282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.423013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.422188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2809622,"sim:weight":0.416732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112840,"sim:weight":0.405813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Moreover there appears to be a lack of awareness as to exactly what data are held and whether they are being\nmanaged. In response to these concerns the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) issued a call for\nproposals to develop and implement a Data Audit Framework suited to the needs of the UK higher education research communities. The Data Audit Framework (DAF) Development project was funded to produce an audit methodology, online toolkit, and a registry. Four additional implementation projects were funded to test the toolkit and promote its uptake. This paper outlines the audit methodology, introduces the online toolkit, and provides feedback on implementing the Data Audit Framework.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Sarah","Ross, Seamus","Ruusalepp, Raivo"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B Aitken.

Archivists have grappled with the question of how to achieve this for about 15 years.  We focus on limitations to preservation, identifying precisely what can be preserved and what cannot.  Our answer comes from the philosophical theory of knowledge, especially its discussion about the limits of what can be communicated.\n  \nPhilosophers have taught that answers to critical questions have been obscured by \"failure to understand the logic of our language\".  We can clarify difficulties by paying extremely close attention to the meaning of words such as \u0027knowledge\u0027, \u0027information\u0027, \u0027the original\u0027, and \u0027dynamic\u0027.\n\nWhat is valuable in transmitted and stored messages, and what should be preserved, is an abstraction, the pattern inherent in each transmitted and stored digital record.  This answer has, in fact, been lurking just below the surface of archival literature.\n  \nTo make progress, archivists must collaborate with software engineers.  Understanding perspectives across disciplinary boundaries will be needed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gladney, Dr. H.M."],"dc:date":"2008-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15583,"sim:weight":0.833446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15629,"sim:weight":0.79731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929316,"sim:weight":0.776865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15591,"sim:weight":0.766391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929315,"sim:weight":0.765133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15630,"sim:weight":0.710617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15655,"sim:weight":0.68885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15654,"sim:weight":0.686529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929313,"sim:weight":0.661424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15656,"sim:weight":0.592149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.510589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.497649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.496697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.482927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.449062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.448636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.442295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.442295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.442295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.442295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The current article responds by sketching how a modest software development\nteam could implement and deploy a previously described conceptual solution, Trustworthy Digital Object\n(TDO) methodology, for the technical component of digital preservation. It emphasizes scholarly and\ncultural digital content, but could be extended to discuss bureaucratic records.\n\nCurators cannot afford unique technology, but must exploit marketplace offerings. Macro economic facts\nsuggest shifting most preservation work from repository institutions to their users. Much of the software\nneeded is available. It has, however, not yet been selected, adapted, integrated, or deployed for digital\npreservation.\n\nOur earlier articles describe conceptual solutions for all known challenges of preserving a single object,\nbut do not deal with software development or collection scaling. We describe a practical strategy for\ndetailed design and implementation of software to automate the clerical component of digital\npreservation. Tools for daily work can embed packaging for preservation without much burdening their\nusers. Document handling is complicated by human sensitivity to communication nuances. Our\nengineering section therefore suggests how project managers can master the many pertinent details.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gladney, Dr. H.M."],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Feigenbaum.

Yet, research into their long‐term viability and the meaningful accessibility of their contents remains in its infancy. In general, as we have pointed out elsewhere, ‘after more\nthan twenty years of research in digital curation and preservation the actual theories, methods and technologies that can either foster or ensure digital longevity remain\nstartlingly limited.’ Research led by DigitalPreservationEurope (DPE) and the Digital\nPreservation Cluster of DELOS has allowed us to refine the key research challenges – theoretical, methodological and technological – that need attention by researchers in digital libraries during the coming five to ten years, if we are to ensure that the materials held in our emerging digital libraries are to remain sustainable, authentic, accessible and understandable over time. Building on this work and taking the theoretical framework of archival science as bedrock, this paper investigates digital preservation and its foundational role if digital libraries are to have long‐term viability at the centre of the\nglobal information society.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ross, Professor Seamus"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931117,"sim:weight":0.490319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2809706,"sim:weight":0.452166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.432202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.392149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.391861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.360587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.359772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The construction of this toolkit is a dynamic process and this is the second stage in this process.  The DRAMBORA toolkit represents the latest development in an ongoing international effort to conceive criteria, means and methodologies for audit and certification of digital repositories. The intention throughout its development has been to build upon, extend and complement existing efforts. A key requirement has been to establish a toolkit that contributes towards a single process for repository assessment. The importance of international cooperation and collaboration, and the potential dangers associated with divergence were acknowledged very early on within the DCC and DPE\u0027s work in this area.\n\nPerhaps the most notable efforts to date within this context are those invested within the RLG/NARA Task Force and the nestor working group to develop criteria for audit and certification of trustworthy digital repositories. Further significant work was led by the Center for Research Libraries (CRL). The results of these efforts have been foremost within our considerations throughout the development of this toolkit, and in the DCC-led pilot audits that preceded it. The DCC/DPE working group has engaged with representatives of other groups to agree upon a set of principles, representing the fundamental, objective baseline criteria for preservation repositories and these, and their underlying concepts, are profoundly important within the toolkit. It is anticipated that self audit based on DRAMBORA can be facilitated if undertaken in association with one or both of the check-lists, and vice versa.. The risk-based approach assists efforts to match a repository against these lists of requirements. Only with a clear view of an organisation\u0027s business context and its implicit risks can an auditor effectively utilise these requirements. The toolkit contextualises these lists so they can be more effectively applied. In addition to these resources, we have also sought to incorporate and adapt ideas and concepts from an additional, diverse range of sources, including a wide range of international information standards, many with their basis in the risk management industry, aiming to broaden ever further the perspectives that our international colleagues have already established.","bibo:AuthorList":["MCHUGH, MR ANDREW","RUUSALEPP, MR RAIVO","ROSS, PROFESSOR SEAMUS","HOFMAN, MR HANS","Digital Curation Centre and DigitalPreservationEurope"],"dc:date":"2007-03-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1394783,"sim:weight":0.594614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585531,"sim:weight":0.367288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931120,"sim:weight":0.3508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15592,"sim:weight":0.273651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.242784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.236542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.226067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To bridge the discrepancy, it often helps to mine scientific texts to aid the understanding of the database. Mining relevant text can be significantly aided by the availability of descriptive and semantic metadata. The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) has undertaken research to automate the extraction of metadata from documents in PDF([22]). Documents may include scientific journal papers, lab notes or even emails. We suggest genre classification as a first step toward automating metadata extraction. The classification method will be built on looking at the documents from five directions; as an object of specific visual format, a layout of strings with characteristic grammar, an object with stylo-metric signatures, an object with meaning and purpose, and an object linked to previously classified objects and external sources. Some results of experiments in relation to the first two directions are described here; they are meant to be indicative of the promise underlying this multi-faceted approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kim, Dr Yunhyong","Ross, Prof Seamus"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Adobe Acrobat PDF specification,","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"Adobe Acrobat PDF specification,"},{"rawReferenceText":"E Riloff, J Wiebe and T Wilson.

It takes a brief look at the digital imaging project and funding landscape to see whether there are other models, which JISC might adopt for future work. So far we have not found any adequate model that provides the building blocks necessary to manage distributed digital imaging projects. While the JIDI model is not complete, it does have many of the key elements that a digital imaging model would require and it has shown itself to be extensible. The recommendations of this review should inform the development of the JISC Distributed Image Service (JDIS) and may contribute to the efforts of funding bodies to structure their funding  initiatives. The provision by JDIS of more effective co-ordination of JISC imaging services and resources will be part of the core of the Distributed National Electronic Resource (DNER). It is essential to bear in mind that here we are only dealing with one type of digitisation, specifically digital imaging. However, the findings and learning points are clearly relevant to a much broader spectrum of concerns for those funding or managing\ndigitisation programmes, including the JISC.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ross, Seamus"],"dc:date":"2000-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.642704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732171,"sim:weight":0.626352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15613,"sim:weight":0.6174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15636,"sim:weight":0.50181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.45258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.449098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.448666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.431856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.425395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Research projects in this area tend to be small and driven by particular institutional problems or concerns. As a consequence, proposed solutions from experimental projects and prototypes tend not to scale to millions of digital objects, nor do the results from disparate projects readily build on each other. It is also unclear whether it is worthwhile to seek general solutions or whether different strategies are needed for different types of digital objects and collections. The lack of coordination in both research and development means that there are some areas where researchers are reinventing the wheel while other areas are neglected. \n\n\nDigital archiving and preservation is an area that will benefit from an exercise in analysis, priority setting, and planning for future research. The WG aims to survey current research activities, identify gaps, and develop a white paper proposing future research directions in the area of digital preservation. Some of the potential areas for research include repository architectures and inter-operability among digital archives; automated tools for capture, ingest, and normalization of digital objects; and harmonization of preservation formats and metadata. There can also be opportunities for development of commercial products in the areas of mass storage systems, repositories and repository management systems, and data management software and tools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hedstrom, M.","Ross, S.","Ashley, K.","Christensen-Dalsgaard, B.","Duff, W.","Gladney, H.","Huc, C.","Kenney, A.

The multi-year URN effort resulted in an underutilized facet of Internet naming architecture embodied in two main IETF standards (RFCs 2141 and 2611).  \n\nURNs were intended to help deal with the problem of resources whose location in the global file Internet file system changed by separating symbolic names from locations, but for a variety of reasons have not enjoyed wide adoption. The divisive and drawn out negotiations surrounding the evolution of this standard reflects the difficulty of the task from a technical point of view and fundamental disagreements about the functional characteristics of generalized naming systems.\n\nLong before the culmination of the URN efforts, OCLC Research introduced PURLs as an open toolset to make it easier to exploit the natural idiom of indirection built into Web infrastructure. PURLs facilitate the management of symbolic resource names by organizations otherwise motivated to promote persistence of resources and their names, and are in use in limited, but significant applications in the Internet realm.\n\nPURLs take advantage of existing, off the shelf, open source software to make it easier to manage resource names.  The PURL system is itself open source, freely available to all.  For all this, PURLs have not become ubiquitous, nor have the classic problems of 404: Document Not Found gone away. This talk will describe the PURL system and discuss its strengths, as well as factors that have mitigated against wider adoption.\n\nFor further information: http://www.purl.org","bibo:AuthorList":[],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15622,"sim:weight":0.356057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930966,"sim:weight":0.211045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.197543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.195114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.176559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.169201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.161515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is done by examining some of the difficulties faced by scientists engaged in scientific research who may have problems working within the constraints of current copyright and database legislation, where property claims can place obstacles in the way of research, in other words, the public domain. The article then looks at perceptions of the public interest and asks whether copyright and the database right reflect understandings of how this concept should operate. Thirdly, it considers the relevance of public funding for scientific research in the context of both the public domain and of the public interest. Finally, some recent initiatives seeking to change the contours of the legal framework are examined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Waelde, Dr Charlotte","McGinley, Ms Mags"],"dc:date":"2005-03-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43107,"sim:weight":0.766183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105669,"sim:weight":0.754022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85217,"sim:weight":0.695545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51462,"sim:weight":0.680879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43122,"sim:weight":0.624013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43131,"sim:weight":0.621903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43126,"sim:weight":0.616897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1058390,"sim:weight":0.608929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69568,"sim:weight":0.566493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43121,"sim:weight":0.542393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43130,"sim:weight":0.538024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9715,"sim:weight":0.490731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710500,"sim:weight":0.484362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145423,"sim:weight":0.441388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1098921,"sim:weight":0.429465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98506,"sim:weight":0.408862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100533,"sim:weight":0.314571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43993,"sim:weight":0.302049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43119,"sim:weight":0.298826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15412,"sim:weight":0.27821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However there has been little substantial progress towards resolving the key technical challenges: first, ensuring the future ability to use producer’s information with computers whose design cannot today be known; and second, creating durable evidence so that each future user can prudently decide whether to trust saved information.\n\nWe outline a solution to these challenges—a solution that we call the Trustworthy Digital Object (TDO) method.  TDOs provide reliable packaging for any type of digital object, no matter how distant its eventual recipients are in time, space, and organizational affiliation from the information sources.  Each preserved object carries its own provenance audit trail.  Information producers can prepare documents for archiving without help or permission from anyone.  Archivists can add metadata without communicating with producers.  Consumers can test the authenticity of preserved documents without human assistance.\n  \nDeep analyses and searching peer critiques are important as preludes to implementation and deployment of any proposed digital preservation solution.  Early twentieth-century philosophy and pictorial models help clarify dilemmas expressed in Archivaria articles and elsewhere.  Our analysis leads us to suggest that the TDO method achieves technical quality against which any method of digital preservation should be judged.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gladney, Dr. H.M."],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Raymond Leppard.

The focus is on national archives and\nscience data archives which have to ingest and integrate data from a broad spectrum of vendor-specific relational\ndatabase management systems (RDBMS).

It enables, to a reasonable level of authenticity, complete detachment\nof databases from their vendor-specific environment. The user can add archival descriptive metadata according to\na customizable schema. A SIARD database archive integrates data, data logic, technical metadata, and archival\ndescriptive information in one archival information package, independent of any specific software and hardware,\nbased upon plain text files and the standardized languages SQL and XML. For usage purposes, a SIARD archive\ncan be reloaded into any current or future RDBMS which supports standard SQL.

Trustworthy Digital Object (TDO) representation and packaging makes any digital content reliably meaningful to consumers, no matter how distant these are in time, in space, and in social affiliation from their information sources.  The current article focuses on digital document authenticity and on evidence a consumer can use to decide whether to trust the content.\n\nSuch considerations are necessarily epistemological.  Arguing the issues must start by conveying as unambiguously as possible what we mean by words like ‘authenticity’ and ‘evidence’ and by distinguishing  between statements that are ‘objective’ and those that are ‘subjective’.  Our analysis applies Wittgenstein’s teaching to pictorial models of digital and conventional communication.\n\nThis analysis leads us to identify an ethical imperative for digital preservation, and to suggest that the TDO method defines a quality standard against which any method of digital preservation should be judged.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gladney, Dr. H.M."],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Bearman and J Trant.

On the one hand IT offers us new ways of creating, using, and making available information and on the other hand it also requires new approaches just because of that, and because of the different nature of digital information. Nonetheless to date a huge mass of digital information resources is available e.g. on the world wide web, and is growing every minute. Accessibility in this respect is a crucial feature of this digital information. How can that be achieved and above all maintained? To what extent are traditional tools and approaches still sufficient? That are questions that many organisations are facing to date.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hofman, Hans (Johannes)"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15645,"sim:weight":0.608241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.596026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.571706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.553845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1339,"sim:weight":0.55158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.549199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.532839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.531475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.508734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Preserving the Authenticity of Digital Objects","bibo:abstract":"At a round table, organised by DigiCULT in May 2002 in Barcelona, representatives of different communities discussed the issue of authenticity of digital information. It turned out to be not easy to understand each other, because of different terminology, or better the use of the same words, but with different meanings, a familiar problem in discussions across domains. One thing was clear, however, it is a relevant issue not limited to one community, but shared by many, as for instance the libraries, broadcasting, and archives communities. Authenticity with respect to documents or information entities is not a new notion. It goes back as long as they exist. In a paper world with physical entities it was not a big issue, because of the fixed form they had. The discussion however, showed that the emergence of information in digital form requires re-thinking in applying it in the digital world. Authenticity may be described as ‘conveying a (digital) object in its ‘original state’ to a user over time’.  Although this may not be an adequate description, it already implies a lot of issues, some of which I want to address in this paper. One of them the issue of what ‘original’ means in a digital environment. One of the recommendations of the round table was to conduct a survey to see what is happening in practice and how authenticity is experienced or seen in different communities, especially in relation to digital objects. It also indicates that no consensus has been reached yet on this issue.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hofman, Hans (Johannes)"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15643,"sim:weight":0.715037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15645,"sim:weight":0.701665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.544884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.534827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.511218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.510007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.487333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.480074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.471737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.470078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.470078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.470078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.470078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.470078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.470078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.470078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.470078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.470078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.470078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.470078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Specifically, it focuses on digital document authenticity and evidence with which a consumer can prudently decide whether to trust the content.\nSuch justifications are necessarily epistemological.\n\nArguing the issues must start by conveying as unambiguously as possible what we mean by words like ‘authenticity’ and ‘evidence’ and by distinctions such as that between ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’.

The topics explored include objective relevance and subjective awareness of digital preservation, cooperation, current practice, costs, and audit.\n\nThe publishing sector is becoming increasingly aware of the importance and value of digital information and of the problems and challenges that lie in preserving it and providing access to it over time. The amount of information produced, received, and managed in digital form increases daily in the publishing sector, and radically affects the main business functions and processes. Most of the seven organisations that participated in this study understand that the main issues affecting them must be resolved in concert with other publishers and organisations that have a stake in the sector. Controls need to be put in place for the creation, management, and preservation of valuable information, and should be developed with other publishers and business partners. This sort of activity is only becoming visible and much still remains to be addressed. \n\nA fuller knowledge within the sector of the demands and challenges of preserving digital information has to be fostered before action can be taken. Certain larger organisations have begun to consider the loss of valuable digital assets a serious risk and are working to find solutions to the problems of cost, standards, establishing responsibility for action. Problems are also raised by proposed technical solutions such as format change, degradation of hardware and software, and quality and completeness. The remaining, smaller organisations, wary of high costs and untested potential solutions, prefer to wait and see what develops in the sector, especially the products of the developing partnerships with major libraries. The organisations involved in this study present a range of examples of understanding and activity, highlighting the work that has been done, and work that remains to be addressed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Electronic Resource Preservation and Access Network (ERPANET)"],"dc:date":"2003-08-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15650,"sim:weight":0.843069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15651,"sim:weight":0.829963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2809706,"sim:weight":0.45523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.446643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.446092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.440582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15612,"sim:weight":0.425067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.420574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.419331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, recent publications communicate little progress against computer science problems identified in 1995: (1) providing authenticity evidence, and (2) ensuring the future ability to execute today’s computer programs on machines whose architectures are not yet known. We have solved both.\n\nOur TDO (Trustworthy Digital Object) packaging makes any digital content trustworthy and reliably meaningful to end users, no matter how distant these are in time, in space, and in social affiliation from the information source. Authors can prepare documents for archiving without\ncentralized coordination. Librarians can add metadata without help from authors. Consumers can evaluate preserved documents’ authenticity without needing other people’s assistance.\n\nThe TDO infrastructure components are only lightly coupled, permitting repositories to operate almost independently of each other. The TDO method is an economical solution compatible with currently deployed digital libraries. Deployments to scale are feasible in 1-2 years.\n\nThe current article is an introduction intended to be useful to planners and managers responsible for the future of digital archives at their institutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gladney, H.M."],"dc:date":"2003-07-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H M Gladney.

What is the simplest security\ninfrastructure sufficient to protect and later test evidence of authenticity?\n\nIn ancient times, wax seals impressed with signet rings were affixed to documents as evidence of\ntheir authenticity. A digital counterpart is a message authentication code fixed firmly to each\nimportant document. If a digital object is sealed together with its own audit trail, each user can\nexamine this evidence to decide whether to trust the content—no matter how distant this user is\nin time, space, and social affiliation from the document’s source.\n\nWe suggest technical means for accomplishing this: encapsulation of the document content with\nmetadata describing its origins, cryptographic sealing, webs of trust for public keys rooted in a\nforest of respected institutions, and a certain way of managing document identifiers. These\nmeans will satisfy emerging needs in civilian and military record management, including medical\npatient records, regulatory records for aircraft and pharmaceuticals, business records for\nfinancial audit, legislative and legal briefs, and scholarly works.\n\nThis is true for any kind of document, independently of its purposes and of most data type and\nrepresentation details, and provides each user with autonomy for most of what he does.\nProducers can prepare works for preservation without permission from or synchronization with\nany authority or service agent. Librarians can add metadata without communicating with\ndocument originators or repository managers. Consumers can test authenticity without Internet\ndelays, apart from those for fetching cryptographic certificates.\n\nOur method accomplishes much of what is sought under labels such as “trusted digital\nrepositories”, and does so more flexibly and economically than any method yet proposed. It\nrequires at most easy extensions of available content management software, and is therefore\ncompatible with what most digital repositories have installed and are using today.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gladney, H.M."],"dc:date":"2003-04-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"David Bearman.

Methods that might work are not good enough; what is preserved today should be reliably intelligible whenever someone wants it.  Prior proposals fail because they generally confound saved data with irrelevant details of today’s information technology—details that are difficult to define, extract, and save completely and accurately.\nWe use a virtual machine to represent and eventually to render any data whatsoever. We focus on a case of intermediate difficulty—an executable procedure—and identify a variant for every other data type.\nThis solution might be more elaborate than needed to render some text, image, audio, or video data.  Simple data can be preserved as representations using well-known standards.  We sketch practical methods for files ranging from simple structures to those containing computer programs, treating simple cases here and deferring complex cases for future work.  Enough of the complete solution is known to enable practical aggressive preservation programs today.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gladney, H.M."],"dc:date":"2004-10-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H M Gladney.

Participants gained familiarity with the main features of the model, and examined some of the processes involved in its interpretation and application. In particular, the seminar focused on how to move from model to implementable preservation solution. Lecturers shared the experience gained by their organisations and institutions in employing the model in the development of their own preservation initiatives. These ranged from commercial organisations and public sector institutions, digital libraries, archives and scientific data centres. Discussions and analyses during breakout sessions were essential to the better understanding of the model’s range of potential applications, as well raising awareness of its limitations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Electronic Resource Preservation and Access Network (ERPANET)"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2002).

The majority of previous studies in automated genre classification have created models based on an amalgamated representation of a document using a combination of features. In these models, the inseparable roles of different features make it difficult to determine a means of improving the classifier when it exhibits poor performance in detecting selected genres.  In this paper we use classifiers independently modeled on three groups of features to examine six genre classes to show that the  strongest features for making one classification is not necessarily the best features for carrying out another classification.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kim, Dr Yunhyong","Ross, Prof Seamus"],"dc:date":"2007-06-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Santini.

This technology is not adequate for long-term digital preservation because it includes no mechanisms for reliably assuring authenticity and intelligibility of digital documents for 50 years or longer.  CM provides for near-term preservation without handling long-term preservation, which must overcome risks associated with technological obsolescence and fading human memory.  We show how to mitigate these risks.  Implementing software would be a small addition to widely deployed CM offerings.\n\nWe recall the essential core of archival principles analyzed by other authors.  We then sketch how our long-term preservation solution, devised for preserving cultural and scholarly digital documents, can be implemented to conform to these archivists\u0027 principles for business records.  It sketches our Trustworthy Digital Object architecture and its design core sufficiently to show how archivists can participate in managing digital repositories that conform and are attuned to the particular needs of any archival institution.  It omits technical details of little interest to records custodians.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gladney, Dr. H.M."],"dc:date":"2008-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15587,"sim:weight":0.53713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15583,"sim:weight":0.535398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15591,"sim:weight":0.495355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931117,"sim:weight":0.495305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929316,"sim:weight":0.494926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55319,"sim:weight":0.490978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15645,"sim:weight":0.471934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929315,"sim:weight":0.462451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15632,"sim:weight":0.429594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15640,"sim:weight":0.399014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15592,"sim:weight":0.397977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15642,"sim:weight":0.391643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15643,"sim:weight":0.372135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15654,"sim:weight":0.370761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15644,"sim:weight":0.362778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732171,"sim:weight":0.359378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15652,"sim:weight":0.35118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25880,"sim:weight":0.335859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15655,"sim:weight":0.329799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.283677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
