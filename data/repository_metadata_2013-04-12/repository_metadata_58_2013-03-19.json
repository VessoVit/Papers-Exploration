{"identifier":13812,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"A role for p38 MAPK in the regulation of ciliary motion in a eukaryote","bibo:abstract":"BACKGROUND: Motile cilia are essential to the survival and reproduction of many eukaryotes; they are responsible for powering swimming of protists and small multicellular organisms and drive fluids across respiratory and reproductive surfaces in mammals. Although tremendous progress has been made to comprehend the biochemical basis of these complex evolutionarily-conserved organelles, few protein kinases have been reported to co-ordinate ciliary beat. Here we present evidence for p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) playing a role in the ciliary beat of a multicellular eukaryote, the free-living miracidium stage of the platyhelminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that non-motile miracidia trapped within eggs prior to hatching displayed phosphorylated (activated) p38 MAPK associated with their ciliated surface. In contrast, freshly-hatched, rapidly swimming, miracidia lacked phosphorylated p38 MAPK. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that treatment of miracidia with the p38 MAPK activator anisomycin resulted in a rapid, sustained, activation of p38 MAPK, which was primarily localized to the cilia associated with the ciliated epidermal plates, and the tegument. Freshly-hatched miracidia possessed swim velocities between 2.17 - 2.38 mm/s. Strikingly, anisomycin-mediated p38 MAPK activation rapidly attenuated swimming, reducing swim velocities by 55% after 15 min and 99% after 60 min. In contrast, SB 203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, increased swim velocity by up to 15% over this duration. Finally, by inhibiting swimming, p38 MAPK activation resulted in early release of ciliated epidermal plates from the miracidium thus accelerating development to the post-miracidium larval stage.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: This study supports a role for p38 MAPK in the regulation of ciliary-beat. Given the evolutionary conservation of signalling processes and cilia structure, we hypothesize that p38 MAPK may regulate ciliary beat and beat-frequency in a variety of eukaryotes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ressurreicao, Margarida","Rollinson, David","Emery, Aidan","Walker, Anthony"],"dc:date":"2011-01-26","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Akok SS, Y Ben-Shahar, Moninger TO, Kline JN and Welsh.

Naturally, social media is attracting a significant attention from researchers probing its educational applicability. Online social networking services (SNS) offer a straightforward way to connect people and support information sharing and communication. University students are often ahead of the rest in the adoption of new technologies, and according to (Quan-Haase, 2007) their communication networks tend to be dense and multilayered. Extant literature abounds with evidence of business opportunities (e.g. Aldrich \u0026 Kim, 2007) and educational use (e.g. Mastrodicasa,2008) of social  networks. However, very little research attention has been paid towards a systematic adoption of SNS throughout the complete student lifecycle . With the aim of achieving higher levels of success in learning as well as improving their career prospects.\r\n\r\nThis study investigates the use of social media by business students.  KU business students and students from four international HE institutions in Europe, including Russia and Greece, have participated in the study. Social media has the potential of providing an easy-to use platform to connect students throughout their entire lifecycle  from aspiration rising, enrolment, learning and teaching leading on to employment, alumni communication and life-long learning. This is especially important as the stages of employability management and life-long learning take a centre stage in managing student expectations and influencing their decision of taking up places at which university.","bibo:AuthorList":["Benson, Vladlena","Morgan, Stephanie","Filippaios, Fragkiskos"],"dc:date":"2010-06-22","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H Aldrich and P Kim.

The findings of in-depth analysis of these interviews have implications for climate change adaptation as a whole. They suggest that government policies to implement a broader range of adaptation measures might be hampered by institutional cultures formed when engineered approaches were the norm. Political decentralisation and the fashion for public consultation exacerbate this effect, leaving decision-makers more responsive to the influence of those directly affected by natural hazards than they are to policy pronouncements by government.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harries, Tim","Penning-Rowsell, Edmund"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Abrams and M Hogg.

Why it can seem better not to protect yourself against a natural hazard","bibo:abstract":"This article presents qualitative research in flood risk areas of England that suggests that the desire to feel secure can sometimes deter people from taking actions that would reduce the actual physical damage of a hazardous natural event. That is, it argues that people sometimes put what Giddens calls their ontological security above their physical security. Preferring to think of their homes as places that are innately safe, they reject the idea of defending them; preferring to think of nature as a positive moral force, they hesitate to view it as a source of real danger; and preferring to think of society as a competent protector of last resort, they are reluctant to accept the need to protect themselves. Being central to ontological security, such social representations (of ï¿½homeï¿½, ï¿½natureï¿½, ï¿½societyï¿½ etc.) are defended by avoiding perceptual shifts and behaviours that might challenge them. This paper discusses how and why they are defended, what happens when they become indefensible and why some householders and groups of householders are more willing than others to take self-protective actions against risks such as flooding.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harries, Tim"],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D ABRAMS and M HOGG.

Chronic fatigue is a common reason for consulting a general practitioner, and some patients report their symptoms are not taken seriously enough. A gap in perceptions may occur because doctors underestimate the impact of fatigue on patients\u0027 lives. The main aim of the study is to explore the economic impact of chronic fatigue in patients seeking help from general practitioners and to identify characteristics that explain variations in costs.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: The design of study was a survey of patients presenting to general practitioners with unexplained chronic fatigue. The setting were 29 general practice surgeries located in the London and South Thames regions of the English National Health Service. Use of services over a six month period was measured and lost employment recorded. Regression models were used to identify factors that explained variations in these costs.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: The mean total cost of services and lost employment across the sample of 222 patients was 3878 pounds for the six-month period. Formal services accounted for 13% of this figure, while lost employment accounted for 61% and informal care for 26%. The variation in the total costs was significantly related to factors linked to the severity of the condition and social functioning.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The economic costs generated by chronic fatigue are high and mostly borne by patients and their families. Enquiry about the functional consequences of fatigue on the social and occupational lives of patients may help doctors understand the impact of fatigue, and make patients feel better understood.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sabes-Figueraa, Ramon","McCrone, Paul","Hurley, Mike","King, Michael","Donaldson, Ana Nora","Ridsdale, Leone"],"dc:date":"2010-03-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Hannay DR.

This role is\r\nknown to sometimes have a negative impact on carers and to require support both informally and from statutory\r\nservices. General practice is a first point of contact for carers but research investigating general practitionersï¿½ (GPsï¿½)\r\nattitudes towards carers and awareness of issues facing carers is rare. This study therefore aimed to identify GPsï¿½\r\nattitudes, awareness of issues, and perceptions of the barriers and enablers to provision of services.\r\nMethods: Using a self-completion questionnaire distributed at a series of workshops, this study investigates GPsï¿½\r\nattitudes to carers; awareness and knowledge of carersï¿½ issues; services offered in general practice and barriers to\r\nsupporting carers.\r\nResults: Seventy eight out of a total of 95 GPs (82% response rate) from a variety of areas in England completed\r\nthe questionnaires. The GPs identified time, resources and lack of knowledge as barriers, but only 9% agreed with\r\nthe statement that there is little support they can offer carers. However, nine in ten GPs (89%) feel they have\r\ninsufficient training here and approximately half of them (47%) lack confidence that they are meeting carersï¿½\r\nneeds. Confidence in identifying carers is also low (45%). Issues that GPs would look out for amongst carers include\r\nemotional and physical health problems and financial and isolation difficulties. GPs specifically highlighted\r\neducational and isolation issues for young carers. Few services were described that targeted carers.\r\nConclusions: GPs recognise that they have an important role to play in supporting carers but would like training\r\nand support. Further investigation is needed both to determine how best to train and facilitate GPs and general\r\npractice teams in their role in supporting carers and to identify what carers need and want from general practice.\r\nIdentifying carersï¿½ leads or carersï¿½ champions amongst practice staff is possibly one way forward. Given the\r\nproposed greater commissioning role for primary care, greater understanding here is particularly important.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greenwood, Nan","Mackenzie, Ann","Habibi, Ruth","Atkins, Christine","Jones, Ray"],"dc:date":"2010-12-20","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Carers UK.

{"identifier":13855,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Monograph","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The barriers and facilitators of supporting self care in Mental Health NHS Trusts","bibo:abstract":"Background\r\nThe Department of Health has prioritised the need to support individuals in the care they take to maintain their own mental health (2005). Research onthe effectiveness of a variety of self care interventions has been reviewed (DH 2007). Challenges to changing from a culture of ‘doing for’ to ‘doing\r\nwith’ have been identified (Wilson 2005).\r\n \r\nWe use a theoretical framework derived from organisational research to explore how health service organisations change (Edwards 2004), complemented with a strong focus\r\non service user involvement in the research process (Faulkner 2002).\r\n\r\nAims\r\nTo identify barriers and facilitators to providing self care support in Mental Health NHS Trusts\r\nTo compare learning about self care support across health service areas.\r\n\r\nMethod \r\nA mixed method cohort study design was used to investigate how self care was supported in three case studies in contrasting Mental Health NHSTrusts. Case studies comprised a range of projects: Wellness Recovery\r\nAction Planning; peer support groups for people with Personality Disorder;creative arts projects provided by voluntary organisations.\r\nDemographic and service use data was collected from service users who were new to self care projects, and again nine months later. Service users\r\nalso completed standard measures of outcomes associated in the literaturewith self care (e.g. empowerment) and qualitative interviews about their expectations and experiences of self care. Informal carers (partners, family\r\nmembers) were also asked about their experiences, as were staff working in the self care projects. Strategic managers in the case study Trusts were asked about organisational issues around implementing self care policy.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of co variance was used to identify variables that might be associated with self care outcomes. A thematic analysis of qualitative interview data explored experiences of self care from a range of stakeholder perspectives. Quantitative findings were further explored through synthesis\r\nwith qualitative interview data. Online survey was used to consider how findings might generalise to Mental Health NHS Trusts nationally.\r\n\r\nLimitations of the study\r\n\r\nAnalysis of change in outcomes was exploratory in nature and was used to identify factors that might impact on change. We selected contrasting selfcare initiatives that served varied populations so that we could identify a broad range of barriers and facilitators of supporting self care. Given the\r\nheterogeneity of our samples, this approach does mitigate againstgeneralising our findings to specific populations, and any conclusions should be read with this proviso in mind.\r\n\r\nFindings\r\nWe report here the most interesting findings indicated by statistical analyses of the data. Although in most comparisons change in outcomes were non-significant, in one site we noted significant reduction of 35% (p\u003d0.005) in A\u0026E attendance, and significant improvement in empowerment and mental health confidence of 3.9 (95% CI 0.8 - 7.0) and\r\n0.5 (95% CI 0.2 - 0.8) points respectively. \r\nA second site also showed significant improvement in mental health confidence of 0.3 (95% CI 0.0 - 0.6) points. Choosing to take medication as prescribed was associated with both empowerment and mental health confidence (p\u003d0.007 and p\u003d0.055).\r\nA higher level of clinical severity at baseline was associated with higher satisfaction with the self care project (B\u003d0.01: 95% CI 0.00, 0.01). A higher quality of life at baseline and more highly rated collaboration with the\r\nmember of staff participants had most contact with were associated with staying engaged with the self care project (p\u003d0.047 and p\u003d0.020 respectively). Following synthesis of quantitative and qualitative analyses we drew conclusions in a number of areas:\r\nServices supporting self carePeer support groups and personal plans were strongly indicated as facilitators of self care when well supported. Service users developed strong\r\npositive identifications where projects focussed on ‘wellness’.\r\n‘Timing’ support for self care was crucial, with service user control over when to access support for self care (self referral) and how to use that support (flexible; ongoing) fundamental to effective support for self care.\r\nControl over engagement in self care support is more important than amount of engagement: support for self care cannot be ‘dosed’.\r\nThere can be no ‘discharge’ to self care: service users were concerned about being ‘abandoned’ by the Trust without a route back at times of crisis.\r\nSelf care and risk\r\nEngaging in self care often required the individual to confront difficult issues: self care involves a degree of ‘positive’ risk for service users andservice provider. Overcoming those issues offered rewards(empowerment).\r\nThe relationship between medication and support for self care was complex:\r\nsome individuals incorporated medication into their self care while some made a decision to come off medication.\r\nSelf care and the service user-staff relationship\r\nAll projects were characterised by a change in the staff role – from provider to enabler – and a change in the service user-staff relationship.\r\nRelationships were informal and non-judgemental of the service user, but where relationships were ‘too relaxed’ service users could lose confidence in\r\nthe ability of the service to provide clinical support at times of crisis.\r\nEmployment of service users as staff on self care support projects offered clear benefits for service users, service user employees and their professional colleagues. However, there were transactional costs of training and supporting service users as staff.\r\n\r\nSelf care and social networks\r\nCarers were positive about self care support and the benefits it offered, butself care impacted on their relationships and could be a source of conflict. Social networks were strengthened through self care, especially where\r\nsupport was given in settings away from the Mental Health Trust and where new, non-mental health identities were nurtured.\r\n\r\nSelf care and the Trust\r\nTrust staff working in self care support were often highly motivated, expressed high job satisfaction and felt well supported in their teams. They also experienced low morale where they felt job security was low.\r\nProfessional resistance to a culture change - delivering services ‘with’ rather than ‘for’ service users - was in evidence, but not widespread. Lack of a strategic approach was a more likely barrier to imbedding change.\r\nThe sustainably of some innovative projects was best achieved by bringing them into the Trust as part of mainstream service provision. However, some\r\nbeneficial features could be lost through mainstreaming.\r\n\r\nSelf care and partnership working.\r\n\r\nWhere support for self care was provided outside of mainstream services\r\nthere were advantages of innovative and flexible ways of working. However,externally provided initiatives were vulnerable to loss of funding.\r\nMany qualities of self care support aligned well with other policy initiatives(e.g. recovery) and social care priorities (e.g. personalisation), facilitatingcross-sector support.\r\n\r\nSelf care policy implementation\r\nCommunication with the other SDO self care research teams indicated that many features of self care support were common across health serviceareas: e.g. commissioning challenges, culture change.\r\n\r\nRecommendations\r\nWe recommend that Mental Health Trusts should:\r\nEnable service users to access self care support, including peer support groups, through properly informed self referral\r\nGive control over how support for self care is used to individual service users through supported personal (self care) planning\r\nEnsure that clinical and crisis support remains accessible to those who are engaged in self care\r\nEmbrace ‘positive risk’ at the heart of self care strategy, personal planning, and risk management policy and procedure\r\nIncorporate joint service user-clinician decision making around medication into personal self care plans\r\nProvide dedicated training (co-facilitated by service users) to staff teams supporting self care\r\nEnsure service user employees are effectively managed and\r\nsupported under appropriate contractual terms and conditions\r\nSupport carers in their changing role, reaching out to those\r\npartners and family members who do not identify as careDemonstrate strategic support for self care in order to recruit and retain the best staff in self care support roles\r\nEnable self care leaders, staff teams and service users to become agents for change through championing their good practice\r\nWork with commissioners, local authorities and voluntary sector partners to ensure to the sustainability of the best projects\r\nConsider whether projects supporting self care best deliver health and social care objectives from within, or outside of the Trust\r\nWe recommend future research in order to:\r\nDetermine, through controlled studies, the effectiveness of\r\nspecific self care interventions, incorporating detailed process\r\nevaluations where interventions are complex in nature\r\nUnderstand the extent to which innovation is driven by policy\r\nand/ or by initiatives originating from service user-practitioner\r\npartnerships, innovative teams and charismatic leaders\r\nInvestigate the impact of changing staff roles and staff-service user relationships on the staff team, including the integration of service user employees into clinical teams\r\nExplore the cost effectiveness of supporting self care in order to better inform commissioning decisions\r\nIdentify when and how support for self care for physical health issues is appropriately provided through the Mental HealthTrust and/ or in partnership with other providers\r\nDevelop community driven solutions to supporting self care that specifically target people from a range of ethnic groups.\r\nExplore how support for self care might be best provided in\r\nspecialist mental health settings\r\nUnderstand how service user involvement in research impacts on the collaborative research process, shapes findings and facilitates the mobilisation of research into practice","bibo:AuthorList":["Gillard , Steve","Edwards, Christine","White, Sarah","White, Rachel","Adams, Katie","Davies, Lucy","Green, Katherine","Kettle, Trevor","Lathlean, Judith","Lucock, Mike","Miller, Stephen","Minogue, Virginia","Nugent, Christine","Simons, Lucy","Turner, Kati"],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Coulter.

With the general intensification of environmental concerns, the focus widens to scrutinise one of the most crucial sectors to development - transport. At the same time policymakers find themselves in a difficult predicament - transport plays an essential role in the economy but increasing transport emissions also have an adverse impact on the environment - and policymakers are therefore called upon to balance the socio-political and economic objectives of \u0027adequate and sustainable transport\u0027.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the evolution of fiscal policy imposed on the UK transport sector over the past decade reveals progress towards achieving environmental objectives - from \u0027carbon footprint\u0027 awareness and emissions trading to advanced technological developments and economic imperatives. Focusing on the implementation of and proposed changes to the air passenger duty, this paper looks at the progress of the environmental policy mechanisms, to raise points for consideration on the reconciliation of objectives: ensuring a sustainable transport sector whilst raising government revenue in a low carbon economy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Truxal, Steven"],"dc:date":"2010-09-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1352138,"sim:weight":0.364545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220228,"sim:weight":0.348808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91147,"sim:weight":0.334376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95780,"sim:weight":0.244384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.225241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65386,"sim:weight":0.209452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.196656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10761,"sim:weight":0.190905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Diet provides a link to a large number of the theories that prevail at the molecular levels. In particular, metal ions form key elements of the radical theory along with having established roles in several age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Lifetime exposure to metals has been linked to ageing by contributions to oxidative stress and neurodegenerative disorders. As many foodstuffs contain high levels and diverse profiles of metals, their cumulative effect on ageing warrants investigation. The cumulative level of concern from environmental exposure can be expressed as a dimensionless index of target hazard quotient (THQ) or for known carcinogens, the target cancer risk (TR). This paper posits that a quantifiable relationship exists between ageing and level of concern resulting from cumulated metal exposure; and that this relationship can be used to develop an ageing-related index of concern from chronic metal ion exposure. As individual differences may facilitate or moderate this cumulated exposure, the potential influence on ageing or on the development of neurodegenerative disorders should be included into the model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Naughton, Declan P","Petroczi, Andrea"],"dc:date":"2008-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Finch CE.

ARTIST consists of a website that provides resources designed to meet these goals. Among the resources are a large, searchable assessment item database, several online topic tests, and a comprehensive test of statistical literacy and reasoning (CAOS). Details of the development of the ARTIST resources, results from an extensive evaluation of the project, and the development of future ARTIST resources are presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["delMas, Robert","Ooms, Ann","Garfield, Joan","Chance, Beth"],"dc:date":"2006-07-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66332,"sim:weight":0.25516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":547845,"sim:weight":0.242077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.235691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":517248,"sim:weight":0.222616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":543256,"sim:weight":0.218765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":543263,"sim:weight":0.209729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930635,"sim:weight":0.203799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9631121,"sim:weight":0.194329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45362,"sim:weight":0.191011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82850,"sim:weight":0.181843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.171473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933572,"sim:weight":0.171473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269975,"sim:weight":0.139485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512474,"sim:weight":0.113472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The resultant virtuoso piece makes extensive use of complex performing skills including the accurate realisation of quarter-tone temperament, passages of extreme tessitura and the execution of high natural harmonics.  The scales in high harmonics are an extension of a technique devised by Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst, whereas the realisation of high partials by depressing two nodes on the same string is believed to be an innovation of the composer.\r\n\r\nThe four movements of Gauge Symmetries are organised in pairs: one employing harmonics (representing particles with mass) and one employing ‘normale’ pitches (representing particles without mass). Fermions is a musical metaphor for the Pauli exclusion principle, where two identical particles cannot remain in the same state.  In Bosons there are four (massless) particles which travel at the same speed and can share the same state.  The movement is constructed as a four-part canon where the time between entries is shortened, allowing the voices to cohere then decohere.  Photinos is a companion to Bosons, where each melody progresses at a different tempo so no pair of melodies can ever cohere.  Baryons and Mesons are observed particles composed of three and two quarks respectively: here the harmonics cohere into quivering or unstable sonorities.

In the period post-Oslo Accords (1993-5) the Palestinian Authority took over responsibility for social programmes within the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). The past twelve years has seen the rapid development of social programming and service development, funded, and often initiated by international donors. Social workers were appointed to work in a range of public and non-governmental organizations to deliver new social programming in an ad hoc fashion, and often without the necessary training to carry out the job functions required. Additionally, there was insufficient understanding of the supervision and support needs of social workers/ counselors.  Supervision arrangements focused on inspection and audit, rather than professional development, growth and support and were perceived as threatening and oppressive.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the Second Intifada in 2000 increased the pressures experienced by professionals including social workers and counselors (Lindsay and Baidoun (2004), and workers were often left in the position of caring for and supporting others, whilst themselves also being the victims of the conflict and with no systematic professional support.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, the Continuing Education Department of Birzeit University in collaboration with Kingston University, London, developed and introduced a Professional Certificate and Diploma in Professional Supervision in order to meet these identified needs.  This was the first professional course in supervision in Palestine. The approach taken to develop these programmes was based on the premise that importing a “off the shelf” programme from another country would not be appropriate for a Palestinian context. A process of critical dialogue between the university, those taking the programme and their employers was initiated to develop a model of professional supervision tailored to meet the needs of Palestinian professional workers. The innovative elements of the programme that was developed included the integration of counseling skills, self-awareness and growth, and supervision tools, including intensive live supervision. An integrated approach to supervision has been formulated which includes learning about human resource management, supportive and developmental supervision.    Four programmes have now been provided.  A participatory evaluative approach has been used for the past two years of programme provision, including working with an external evaluator.\r\n\r\nThis paper will present the results of this evaluation highlighting the importance of participation of all stakeholders in the development and evaluation of such a new initiative.  Some of the dilemmas that arose in the provision of such programming will be outlined, including the challenges of educating workers who had been professionally neglected and isolated; delivering a programme during a period of acute political conflict and occupation; Palestinisation of educational materials, and securing recognition of the need for supervision by public, private and non-governmental organizations. \r\n\r\nIn an era that is experiencing a rapid growth in psychosocial programming internationally, we would argue for the necessity of the inclusion of education programmes in professional supervision.  We consider that the results of our evaluation may be of relevance to educators and professionals in other national contexts.

In addition, literature on the state of mathematics in society indicates that the changing nature of the student population and attitudes of professionals towards teaching and learning has led to the identification of a key set of issues which are in the process of being addressed.  These include the dramatic fall in the number of students who were studying A-level and Further Mathematics; the declining number and quality of students entering degree programmes with a strong mathematical element; the lack of qualified mathematics teachers and the need for changes to the mathematics curriculum.  \r\n\r\nThis report outlines the specific ways in which one institution is tackling the issues through the development of a university course for non mathematics graduates aiming to become teachers; the provision of Further Mathematics courses for students pre-entry; and the addition of mathematics education and teaching options to the final year modules for students studying mathematics at the university. It demonstrates how the university as an institution, its students and the local community in particular are benefiting from this civic university approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Atkins, Nigel","May, Steve","Marks-Maran, Diane","Gay, Jane"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N Atkins, S May and D Marks-Maran.

HYPOTHESIS: It is assumed that people\u0027s own behaviour, owing to the FCE, affects their estimation of the prevalence of that behaviour. It is further hypothesised that a person\u0027s estimate of PED population use is a reliable indicator of the doping behaviour of that person, in lieu of self-reports. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Over- or underestimation is calculated from investigating known groups (i.e. users vs. non-users), using a short questionnaire, and a known prevalence rate from official reports or sample evidence. It is proposed that sample evidence from self-reported behaviour should be verified using objective biochemical analyses.In order to find proofs of concept for the existence of false consensus, a pilot study was conducted. Data were collected among competitive UK student-athletes (n \u003d 124) using a web-based anonymous questionnaire. User (n \u003d 9) vs. non-user (n \u003d 76) groups were established using self-reported information on doping use and intention to use PEDs in hypothetical situations. Observed differences in the mean estimation of doping made by the user group exceeded the estimation made by the non-user group (35.11% vs. 15.34% for general doping and 34.25% vs. 26.30% in hypothetical situations, respectively), thus providing preliminary evidence in support of the FCE concept in relation to doping. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The presence of the FCE in estimating doping prevalence or behaviour in others suggests that the FCE based approach may be an avenue for developing an indirect self-report mechanism for PED use behaviour. The method may be successfully adapted to the estimation of prevalence of behaviours where direct self-reports are assumed to be distorted by socially desirable responding. Thus this method can enhance available information on socially undesirable, health compromising behaviour (i.e. PED use) for policy makers and healthcare professionals. The importance of the method lies in its usefulness in epidemiological studies, not in individual assessments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petroczi , Andrea","Mazanov , Jason","Nepusz , Tamas","Backhouse , Susan H","Naughton , Declan P"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B Kayser, A Mauron and Miah.

SETTING: Retrospective analyses of anonymous enquiries recorded in the DID in 2006 and 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Athletes and supporting personnel. RESULTS: The DID recorded 223 717 enquiries with 200 of the \u003e6000 UK licensed pharmaceutical products receiving over 100 enquiries each. The majority (79.2%) of these enquiries were in the pharmaceutical product category, followed by recreational drugs (10.4%). A variety of common medications were subject to enquiry, with anti-inflammatory agents, decongestants and bronchodilators being most common; a trend in keeping with reported medication use by athletes. Of all enquiries, 42% were not found owing to misspelled words or enquiries about unregulated substances. The proportion of enquiries about substances not listed in the database is relatively high and has increased over the 24 month observation period. CONCLUSION: The DID is a well-used information resource with some 10 000 enquiries being made each month. Of the c. 60% of successful enquiries, the major focus was on pharmaceutical products. With some 73% of enquiries being made by the athletes themselves, further investigations are warranted to explore enquiry patterns in relation to specific sports. Of the unsuccessful enquiries, a large number were related to nutritional supplements, which warrants further investigation. The DID database appears to be a valid mirror of athletes\u0027 chemically assisted practices and may be successfully used to inform health professionals as well as antidoping prevention programmes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petróczi, A","Naughton, DP"],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G Lippi, M Franchini and Guidi GC.

{"identifier":89926,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Heavy metal ions in wines: meta-analysis of target hazard quotients reveal health risks","bibo:abstract":"BACKGROUND: Metal ions such as iron and copper are among the key nutrients that must be provided by dietary sources. Numerous foodstuffs have been evaluated for their contributions to the recommended daily allowance both to guide for satisfactory intake and also to prevent over exposure. In the case of heavy metal ions, the focus is often on exposure to potentially toxic levels of ions such as lead and mercury. The aim of this study is to determine target hazard quotients (THQ) from literature reports giving empirical levels of metal ions in table wines using the reference upper safe limit value. Contributions to the THQ value were calculated for seven metal ions along with total values for each wine. RESULTS: The THQ values were determined as ranges from previously reported ranges of metal ion concentrations and were frequently concerningly high. Apart from the wines selected from Italy, Brazil and Argentina, all other wines exhibited THQ values significantly greater than one indicating levels of risk. The levels of vanadium, copper and manganese had the highest impact on THQ measures. Typical potential maximum THQ values ranged from 50 to 200 with Hungarian and Slovakian wines reaching 300. THQ values for a sample of red and white wines were high for both having values ranging from 30 to 80 for females based on a 250 mL glass per day. CONCLUSION: The THQ values calculated are concerning in that they are mainly above the safe level of THQ\u003c1. It is notable that in the absence of upper safe limits, THQ values cannot be calculated for most metal ions, suggesting that further unaccountable risks are associated with intake of these wines.","bibo:AuthorList":["Naughton, Declan P","Petroczi, Andrea"],"dc:date":"2008-10-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9599570,"sim:weight":0.7262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543317,"sim:weight":0.653195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89821,"sim:weight":0.424875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.180898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.174091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.173603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.173603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.171671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.160855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.16085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.158396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.158396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25848,"sim:weight":0.144965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.141697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76088,"sim:weight":0.13614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.132687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.130331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269979,"sim:weight":0.125808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102560,"sim:weight":0.125381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.1118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two of the modes appear plausible but none are supported by evidence that cannot be explained more simply. The conceptual framework omits inherently tacit knowledge, and uses a radically subjective definition of knowledge: knowledge is in effect created by managers. A new framework is proposed suggesting that different kinds of knowledge are created by different kinds of behaviour. Following Dewey, non-reflectional behaviour is distinguished from reflective behaviour, the former being associated with tacit knowledge, and the latter with explicit knowledge. Some of the implications for academic and managerial practice are considered.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gourlay, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2006-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.441137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.350198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.335062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.31726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.311037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.302699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.294614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46580,"sim:weight":0.291569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.273851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.273429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.267059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45163,"sim:weight":0.261119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.252897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.235571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382013,"sim:weight":0.223545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

From the insistent and piercing scream of the opening to the unearthly oboe multiphonics and exotic dawn chorus of the close, the work was written to exploit the virtuosity of the commissioner, oboist Christopher Redgate.  The work builds on a research collaboration to realise contemporary works for oboe and live electronics with new computer technology, and create new work and exploits the ‘extended techniques’ developed by Redgate: the extreme high register, quarter-tone fingerings, sustained multiphonics and circular breathing.\r\n\r\nThe melodic writing adapts the constructive techniques of Traces, employing quarter-tone pitch-class-sets related to the interval set \u003c1,1,2,3\u003e.  A melody is created from overlapping these sets which resembles a keening lament of narrow range.  In the second half of the work the sustained multiphonic sonorities are unfolded as a pitch resource for short chromatic flurries suggesting exotic birdsong.\r\n\r\nThe work builds on several years of my research into the Max/MSP programming language.  The computer program I developed is used to capture and process brief fragments of the oboe line and create a dense chorus of simulacra and distorted replicas.  A particular feature of this program is the control architecture that allows fragments to be employed in a precisely co-ordinated and interactive performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Archbold, Paul"],"dc:date":"2004-10-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108512,"sim:weight":0.0748482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":89963,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Composition","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Traces","bibo:abstract":"Traces was commissioned as the new work in a composer profile concert in the Klangspuren series of the Munich Biennale.  The concert programme was devised to set my work in the context of music which had inspired and influenced it: for example, the programme included Debussy’s Étude pour piano ‘Pour les agréments’ which inspired the use of the arabesque in Traces.\r\n\r\nThe harmonic basis of Traces is a typical sonority of Debussy, a major 13th chord (taken from b1 of the étude).  This is refracted as a series of five note pitch-class-sets which are permutations of the interval set \u003c1,2,2,3\u003e.   Traces is concerned with my ongoing research into the development of contrapuntal procedures first employed in my Piano Trio (1999, score available on request) to integrate simple major triads with more complex and dissonant sonorities to create a rich and luminous harmonic palette.\r\n\r\nIn the first movement these contrapuntal procedures focus on the four-part canon at the unison which is combined with an isorhythmic structure with prolation 12:8:6:4:3:2 to transform the triadic focus of the opening melody into a rapid and intense chromatic hocket.  The second movement develops the melody in a series of arabesques traced from abrupt piano chords, with a fluidity of texture inspired by the Debussy étude.  The arabesques become more extreme in melodic range and temporal variation passing rapidly from instrument to instrument, stretching the virtuosity of the unconducted ensemble.","bibo:AuthorList":["Archbold, Paul"],"dc:date":"2003-10-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":10381,"sim:weight":0.392243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44235,"sim:weight":0.148435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The word ‘recoil’ is used in two senses: to change speed and direction as a result of a collision; to shrink in fear. The work represents a labyrinth of memory, where the fragmented self confronts distorted realities and fearful illusions.\r\n\r\nRecoil builds upon the harmonic explorations of my string quartet Impacts and Fractures (1999): a ‘dominant seventh’ chord, partials 4-7 of the harmonic series, is tempered to the quarter-tone scale and elaborated to create a series of complex modes.  These modes regulate all the melodic and harmonic material for both the soloist and the tape part.  The tape part is derived entirely from the processed recording of an acoustic piano, and takes the role of a superinstrument that confronts, encompasses and absorbs the soloist.\r\n\r\nThe work is a result of the extensive analysis and processing of melodic fragments, performed on the piano by myself, employing the recent IRCAM program ‘Audiosculpt’.  These fragments are: transposed by microintervals to produce a harmonically rich chorus of arabesques; independently modified in pitch and tempo to realise rhythmically complex dialogues with the soloist; filtered and transposed to create a continuum of sounds ranging from a recognisable piano towards noise; greatly expanded in length to reveal a gradually unfolding, haunting soundworld. Spatialisation is central to the concept of the work: sounds are carefully positioned and moved in space to produce an unreal acoustic labyrinth surrounding the soloist.","bibo:AuthorList":["Archbold, Paul"],"dc:date":"2004-03-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52216,"sim:weight":0.122751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108023,"sim:weight":0.12168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67870,"sim:weight":0.0893153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67872,"sim:weight":0.0882798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67873,"sim:weight":0.0882798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67875,"sim:weight":0.0862955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1548636,"sim:weight":0.0862955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.0762142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108512,"sim:weight":0.0639383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its importance is emphasised in several laws, in ethical codes of conduct as well as in the literature, yet there is only very limited empirical research on privacy in the occupational health context. Conceptual questions on privacy in the occupational health context are discussed. The baseline assumption is that, in this context, privacy cannot be approached and examined only from the employee’s (an individual) vantage point but the employer’s (a group) point of view must also be taken into account, and that the concept has several dimensions (physical, social, informational and psychological). Even though privacy is a basic human need, there is no universally accepted definition of the concept and no consensus on whether an organisation can have privacy in the same way as people do. Many of the challenges surrounding privacy in the context of occupational health seem to be associated with the dual loyalties of occupational health professionals towards the employee and employer and with their simultaneous duties of disseminating and protecting information (informational privacy). Privacy is thus not an absolute value, but more research is needed to understand its multidimensional nature in the context of occupational health.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heikkinen, A.","Launis, V.","Wainwright, P.","Leino-Kilpi, H."],"dc:date":"2006-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1649312,"sim:weight":0.346325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.303553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.258925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.257038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.250315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77040,"sim:weight":0.239208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75279,"sim:weight":0.236827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.235127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.235127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.232544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.230514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.223914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.222003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.219282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.21902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75264,"sim:weight":0.213765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177375,"sim:weight":0.210822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.206847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77596,"sim:weight":0.206792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99226,"sim:weight":0.18211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The accuracy of the gene expression depends on the experiment itself and further image processing. It\u0027s well known that the noises introduced during the experiment will greatly affect the accuracy of the gene expression. How to eliminate the effect of the noise constitutes a challenging problem in microarray analysis. Traditionally, statistical methods are used to estimate the noises while the microarray images are being processed. In this paper, we present a new approach to deal with the noise inherent in the microarray image processing procedure. That is, to denoise the image noises before further image processing using stationary wavelet transform (SWT). The time invariant characteristic of SWT is particularly useful in image denoising. The testing result on sample microarray images has shown an enhanced image quality. The results also show that it has a superior performance than conventional discrete wavelet transform and widely used adaptive Wiener filter in this procedure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, X.H.","Istepanian, R.S.H.","Yong, Hua Song"],"dc:date":"2003-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"X H Wang, R S H Istepanian and Y H Song.

The approach is based on the detection of wavelet modulus maxima in the microarray images. The detected maxima is actually the contour of the spots and thus the spots are recognized precisely. Then, the intensities within the contour of the spots can be obtained with low error rate. The test results on example image show this is an effective approach, especially for those spots with low intensities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, X. H.","Istepanian, R. S.

The sections show consistent stratigraphic trends and δ13C values that provide a basis for highresolution correlation. Positive and negative δ13Cexcursions and inflection points on the isotope profiles are used to define 72 isotope events. Key markers are provided by positive δ13C excursions of up to + 2‰: the Albian/CenomanianBoundary Event; Mid-Cenomanian Event I; theCenomanian/Turonian Boundary Event; the Bridgewick, Hitch Wood and Navigation events of Late Turonian age; and the Santonian/Campanian Boundary Event. Isotope events are isochronous within a framework provided by macrofossil datum levels and bentonite horizons. An age-calibrated composite δ13C reference curve and an isotope event stratigraphy are constructed using data from the English Chalk. The isotope stratigraphy is applied to successions in Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Correlation with pelagic sections at Gubbio, central Italy, demonstrates general agreement between biostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic criteria in the Cenomanian–Turonian stages, confirming established relationships between Tethyan planktonic foraminiferal and Boreal macrofossil biozonations. Correlation of the Coniacian–Santonian stages is less clear cut: magnetostratigraphic evidence for placing the base of Chron 33r near the base of the Upper Santonian is in good agreement with the carbon-isotope correlation, but generates significant anomalies regarding the placement of the Santonian and Campanian stage boundaries with respect to Tethyan planktonic foraminiferal and nannofossil zones. Isotope stratigraphy offers a more reliable criterion for detailed correlation of Cenomanian–Santonian strata than biostratigraphy.With the addition of Campanian δ13C data from one of the English sections, a composite Cenomanian–Campanian age-calibrated reference curve is presented that can be utilized in future chemostratigraphic studies. \r\nThe Cenomanian–Campanian carbon-isotope curve is remarkably similar in shape to supposedly eustatic sea-level curves: increasing δ13C values accompanying sea-level rise associated with transgression, and falling δ13C values characterizing sea-level fall and regression. The correlation between carbon isotopes and sea-level is explained by variations in epicontinental sea area affecting organic-matter burial fluxes: increasing shallow sea-floor area and increased accommodation space accompanying sea-level rise allowedmore efficient burial ofmarine organic matter, with the preferential removal of 12C from the marine carbon reservoir. During sea-level fall, reduced seafloor area, marine erosion of previously deposited sediments, and exposure of basin margins led to reduced organiccarbon burial fluxes and oxidation of previously deposited organic matter, causing falling δ13C values. Additionally, drowning of carbonate platforms during periods of rapid sea-level rise may have reduced the global inorganic relative to the organic carbon flux, further enhancing δ13C values, while renewed platform growth during late transgressions and highstands prompted increased carbonate deposition. Variations in nutrient supply, changing rates of oceanic turnover, and the sequestration or liberation of methane from gas hydrates may also have played a role in controlling carbon-isotope ratios.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jarvis, I.","Gale, A.S.","Jenkyns, H.C.","Pearce, M.A."],"dc:date":"2006-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108181,"sim:weight":0.57351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":967226,"sim:weight":0.564719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1132395,"sim:weight":0.521349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386242,"sim:weight":0.451916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":964344,"sim:weight":0.440474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23512,"sim:weight":0.411233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":379394,"sim:weight":0.408755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5838654,"sim:weight":0.402815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386240,"sim:weight":0.390506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58887,"sim:weight":0.389503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384213,"sim:weight":0.371397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":541089,"sim:weight":0.36062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56656,"sim:weight":0.360168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22552,"sim:weight":0.344875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386149,"sim:weight":0.34049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64301,"sim:weight":0.340418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62589,"sim:weight":0.339036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2674756,"sim:weight":0.33166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269966,"sim:weight":0.330368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":855976,"sim:weight":0.32643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The method is specifically adaptable for packetized telecardiology applications. The signal is segmented into beats and a beat template is subtracted from them, producing a residual signal. Beat templates and residual signals are coded with a wavelet expansion. Compression is achieved by selecting a subset of wavelet coefficients. The number of selected coefficients depends on a threshold which has different definitions depending on the operational mode of the coder. Compression performance has been tested using a subset of ECG records from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. This method has been designed for real-time packetized telecardiology scenarios both in wired and wireless environments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alesanco, A.","Olmos, S.","Istepanian, R. S.

The objective of this investigation is to determine the major factors that influence the propensity to export of Polish SMEs within the context of an expanded European Union (EU). Using data from a survey of enterprises in the Gdansk province, we develop a Logit model to explain why some SMEs are exporters and others are not. The results indicate that access to bank loans, knowledge of competing firms, a large share of the domestic market and preparedness for the accession of Poland to the EU are important drivers of export propensity. We find evidence that awareness of special foreign credit available for Polish SMEs has a positive influence on their export propensity, as also does the use of IT tools in distribution and marketing. On the contrary we find that firms which have high profitability in their domestic market, or are concerned about taxation, or possess a large percentage of Polish capital have a reduced propensity to export.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nguyen, Truc Le","Ghatak, Subrata","Daly, Vincent"],"dc:date":"2006-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383614,"sim:weight":0.56556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5092306,"sim:weight":0.540076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46760,"sim:weight":0.533031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.432146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671481,"sim:weight":0.422933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383594,"sim:weight":0.4188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.418514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108312,"sim:weight":0.394667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.387764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.354215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.353209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.345623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090812,"sim:weight":0.321077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44471,"sim:weight":0.306349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.30365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.30365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47321,"sim:weight":0.290959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381928,"sim:weight":0.287733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386651,"sim:weight":0.265221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46815,"sim:weight":0.254988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The conclusion is that it is a risky strategy and that therefore the correct alternative should be employed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Daly, Vince"],"dc:date":"2006-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383664,"sim:weight":0.353465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47029,"sim:weight":0.335502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46836,"sim:weight":0.320725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45188,"sim:weight":0.314102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45926,"sim:weight":0.299867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18129,"sim:weight":0.296349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23336,"sim:weight":0.290881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352128,"sim:weight":0.289802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381936,"sim:weight":0.285448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.280862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94116,"sim:weight":0.278802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382092,"sim:weight":0.263857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.262429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18180,"sim:weight":0.257618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44388,"sim:weight":0.245597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99194,"sim:weight":0.237743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387142,"sim:weight":0.225085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383586,"sim:weight":0.224562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46817,"sim:weight":0.222064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44680,"sim:weight":0.221059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":90116,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Automatic generation of 3D motifs for classification of protein binding sites","bibo:abstract":"BACKGROUND: Since many of the new protein structures delivered by high-throughput processes do not have any known function, there is a need for structure-based prediction of protein function. Protein 3D structures can be clustered according to their fold or secondary structures to produce classes of some functional significance. A recent alternative has been to detect specific 3D motifs which are often associated to active sites. Unfortunately, there are very few known 3D motifs, which are usually the result of a manual process, compared to the number of sequential motifs already known. In this paper, we report a method to automatically generate 3D motifs of protein structure binding sites based on consensus atom positions and evaluate it on a set of adenine based ligands.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Our new approach was validated by generating automatically 3D patterns for the main adenine based ligands, i.e. AMP, ADP and ATP. Out of the 18 detected patterns, only one, the ADP4 pattern, is not associated with well defined structural patterns. Moreover, most of the patterns could be classified as binding site 3D motifs. Literature research revealed that the ADP4 pattern actually corresponds to structural features which show complex evolutionary links between ligases and transferases. Therefore, all of the generated patterns prove to be meaningful. Each pattern was used to query all PDB proteins which bind either purine based or guanine based ligands, in order to evaluate the classification and annotation properties of the pattern. Overall, our 3D patterns matched 31% of proteins with adenine based ligands and 95.5% of them were classified correctly.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: A new metric has been introduced allowing the classification of proteins according to the similarity of atomic environment of binding sites, and a methodology has been developed to automatically produce 3D patterns from that classification. A study of proteins binding adenine based ligands showed that these 3D patterns are not only biochemically meaningful, but can be used for protein classification and annotation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nebel, Jean-Christophe","Herzyk, Pawel","Gilbert, David R."],"dc:date":"2007-08-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91123,"sim:weight":0.449006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99378,"sim:weight":0.340673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386709,"sim:weight":0.326742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99048,"sim:weight":0.304954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385988,"sim:weight":0.280828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24013,"sim:weight":0.273996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.271739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.261346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.257725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9425632,"sim:weight":0.234305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.218719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.213223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98653,"sim:weight":0.189941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335646,"sim:weight":0.179639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.176923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.175873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338297,"sim:weight":0.174589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":192067,"sim:weight":0.171058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335626,"sim:weight":0.170133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335630,"sim:weight":0.161543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of the study was to evaluate the care provided to patients receiving out-of-hours home visits from ECPs in London from the patients\u0027 perspective and to assess their wellbeing following the visit. METHODS: A bespoke telephone-administered questionnaire was designed to survey all patients who had received out-of-hours care in Bromley Primary Care Trust from ECPs during a ten week period in 2005 (n \u003d 174). RESULTS: Sixty three patients (36.2%) were excluded because: no telephone number was available; they had a diagnosis of dementia; or had not received a study information sheet. The remainder (n \u003d 111) were contacted 3-5 days after the home visit, and 81 of these (73.0%) completed the survey. Of those respondents treated at home who gave unequivocal answers (n \u003d 60), all but one (8.3%) reported that they felt that their treatment had been \u0027right\u0027 and/or had followed any advice given. However, overall only 86.4% reported that they had been clear about their ECP\u0027s assessment, and only 58.0% reported that their health was now \u0027better\u0027. Those who reported that they were not clear about their assessment were less likely to report that their health was \u0027better\u0027 (p \u003d 0.03) and more likely to have subsequently used hospital-based health services (p \u003d 0.03). CONCLUSION: Most patients treated at home by ECPs appeared satisfied and compliant with the care provided, according to the measures used in this study. However, it appears that a sizeable minority of patients were unclear about ECP assessments and it remains to be seen whether these patients had pre-existing health complaints which made them less likely to recover and more likely to seek hospital care, or whether the lack of clarity about their assessment undermined their subsequent recovery and necessitated hospital care. Further research is required to establish if the assessments provided by ECPs are less clear than those provided by other practitioners, and whether it is possible to ensure that all such assessments are clear to all patients. Patients hold a mainly positive view of out-of-hours home visit care provided by ECPs, although a lack of clarity about their assessment was evident, with a possible impact on their continuing health.","bibo:AuthorList":["Halter, Mary","Marlow, Tom","Mohammed, Daryl","Ellison, George T.H."],"dc:date":"2007-06-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90271,"sim:weight":0.564902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.526977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105295,"sim:weight":0.470396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.451269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.446096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.383023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.369018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.334494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.333365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.320472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.286745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":192553,"sim:weight":0.22612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17910,"sim:weight":0.221738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999925,"sim:weight":0.205168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337428,"sim:weight":0.198922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":90134,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Attitudes and doping: A structural equation analysis of the relationship between athletes\u0027 attitudes, sport orientation and doping behaviour","bibo:abstract":"BACKGROUND: For effective deterrence methods, individual, systemic and situational factors that make an athlete or athlete group more susceptible to doping than others should be fully investigated. Traditional behavioural models assume that the behaviour in question is the ultimate end. However, growing evidence suggests that in doping situations, the doping behaviour is not the end but a means to an end, which is gaining competitive advantage. Therefore, models of doping should include and anti-doping policies should consider attitudes or orientations toward the specific target end, in addition to the attitude toward the \u0027tool\u0027 itself. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to empirically test doping related dispositions and attitudes of competitive athletes with the view of informing anti-doping policy developments and deterrence methods. To this end, the paper focused on the individual element of the drug availability - athlete\u0027s personality - situation triangle. METHODS: Data were collected by questionnaires containing a battery of psychological tests among competitive US male college athletes (n \u003d 199). Outcome measures included sport orientation (win and goal orientation and competitiveness), doping attitude, beliefs and self-reported past or current use of doping. A structural equation model was developed based on the strength of relationships between these outcome measures. RESULTS: Whilst the doping model showed satisfactory fit, the results suggested that athletes\u0027 win and goal orientation and competitiveness do not play a statistically significant role in doping behaviour, but win orientation has an effect on doping attitude. The SEM analysis provided empirical evidence that sport orientation and doping behaviour is not directly related. CONCLUSION: The considerable proportion of doping behaviour unexplained by the model suggests that other factors play an influential role in athletes\u0027 decisions regarding prohibited methods. Future research, followed by policy development, should incorporate these factors to capture the complexity of the doping phenomenon and to identify points for effective anti-doping interventions. Sport governing bodies and anti-doping organisations need to recognise that using performance enhancements may be more of a rational, outcome optimizing behaviour than deviance and consider offering acceptable alternative performance-enhancing methods to doping.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petroczi, Andrea"],"dc:date":"2007-11-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90262,"sim:weight":0.779305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539585,"sim:weight":0.692678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89917,"sim:weight":0.651329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90504,"sim:weight":0.645433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539253,"sim:weight":0.619645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":245586,"sim:weight":0.480964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90243,"sim:weight":0.375486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90246,"sim:weight":0.331008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50146,"sim:weight":0.30948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.258158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.237217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.229935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.228102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45348,"sim:weight":0.213774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381989,"sim:weight":0.205273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.201156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.194314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.194236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67775,"sim:weight":0.190313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.190113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Final Report January 2006","bibo:abstract":"BANKRUPTCY COURTS SURVEY 2005\r\nIn March 2005 the Centre for Insolvency Law and Policy (CILP), Kingston Law School, Kingston University, received Â£26,600 research funding to undertake two pilot studies. The funding was provided by the Insolvency Service, an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry. The first project, which was originally due to report in November 2005, is entitled the Bankruptcy Courts Survey 2005 (BCS 2005). It now reports in January 2006, to take into account\r\nthe continued flow of questionnaire responses coming in to CILP. The project as proposed originally consisted of a pilot study questionnaire of three bankruptcy courts in England and Wales (Birmingham, Croydon, and Reading). This number was however expanded during the course of the research to include three further courts (Cardiff, Exeter, and Newcastle). This expansion was deemed necessary so as to gain a greater number of responses to the questionnaire thus giving greater statistical validity to the results. The BCS 2005 project received Â£12,000 of the research funding. Project Two, which will report in March 2006, received the\r\nremaining Â£14,600. This project is an examination of the concept of phoenixism in insolvency and is being conducted by Fiona Tolmie, director of CILP.\r\n\r\nREPORT SUMMARY\r\nThe Main Conclusions of the Bankruptcy Court Survey 2005 (BCS 2005) are:\r\nDebtor associated:\r\nâ�¢ The main cause of bankruptcy is bankrupt acknowledged credit misuse, followed by business failure.\r\nâ�¢ Males are the majority users of the bankruptcy regime.\r\nâ�¢ There is no definitive age range for the typical bankrupt.\r\nâ�¢ Debtors present the majority of bankruptcy petitions.\r\nâ�¢ The vast majority of bankrupts are not homeowners prior to bankruptcy.\r\nâ�¢ Bankruptcy does not affect employment.\r\nâ�¢ Knowledge of the Enterprise Act 2002 provisions and their effects is low amongst bankrupts.\r\nâ�¢ The majority of bankrupts feel morally at fault for their debt problems.\r\nâ�¢ A large majority of bankrupts did not know what level of indebtedness they were being released from.\r\nCreditor associated:\r\nâ�¢ Bankrupts experience immense difficulties in obtaining bank accounts post discharge, which inhibits them from rehabilitation into the credit world.\r\nâ�¢ The non-monetary effects of bankruptcy are voluminous, but primarily feature dissatisfaction with lenders.\r\nProcedure associated:\r\nâ�¢ Informal voluntary arrangements and individual voluntary arrangements are close second choice solutions for over-indebted individuals.\r\nâ�¢ Alternative routes to bankruptcy are explored prior to the bankruptcy route being pursued.\r\nâ�¢ Word of mouth and voluntary sector advice are the main information conduits for personal insolvency advice.\r\nâ�¢ Bankruptcy as an experience is overwhelmingly perceived as negative and stigmatising by bankrupts.\r\nâ�¢ Bankrupts sum up the bankruptcy process as being ultimately an efficient system.\r\nâ�¢ The one year maximum period before automatic discharge is deemed sufficient by bankrupts.\r\n\r\nProfession/Advice associated:\r\nâ�¢ Communication and advice from Trustees in Bankruptcy is good according to bankrupts.\r\nâ�¢ Communication and advice from the Official Receiver is overwhelmingly good according to bankrupts.\r\nâ�¢ Bankruptcy jurisdiction within the County Courts is efficient and the supporting infrastructure is well maintained.\r\nâ�¢ On the whole lawyers are not involved in the bankruptcy process in terms of advice; the Citizens Advice Bureau is the main provider of personal insolvency advice.\r\n\r\nPilot Study Preliminary Recommendations\r\nThe main recommendations of the BCS 2005 are:\r\nâ�¢ Consider the division of bankruptcy into a two-tier system differentiating between entrepreneurially derived debt and consumer derived debt, perhaps under the headings of â��business bankruptcyâ�� and â��personal bankruptcyâ��.\r\nâ�¢ Formulate and enact a system of debtor and creditor education.\r\nâ�¢ In light of the recent dramatic growth in consumer debt levels reappraise the conduct of consumer debtors, but in particular lending institutions, focusing on the creditorâ��s responsibility and conduct regarding the consumer debtorâ��s\r\npersonal over-indebtedness.\r\nâ�¢ Whilst considering the division of the bankruptcy procedure between â��business bankruptcyâ�� and â��personal bankruptcyâ�� also consider eradicating the term\r\nâ��bankruptcyâ�� for non-culpable consumer debt cases.\r\nâ�¢ It is further recommended that the BCS 2005 pilot study be expanded from its 6 court sample to a full study that encompasses 30 of the 136 bankruptcy courts in\r\nEngland and Wales to give a better impression of the treatment and experience of the bankruptcy court user.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tribe, John"],"dc:date":"2006-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90201,"sim:weight":0.52125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90635,"sim:weight":0.429783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108643,"sim:weight":0.277011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.241651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99043,"sim:weight":0.238264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46839,"sim:weight":0.230729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45050,"sim:weight":0.220785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.220113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108340,"sim:weight":0.216948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.215138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.213328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.210618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106153,"sim:weight":0.210406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46838,"sim:weight":0.207733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352201,"sim:weight":0.206763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47011,"sim:weight":0.199939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.199371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383648,"sim:weight":0.197813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.197441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382037,"sim:weight":0.192838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":90201,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Personal insolvency law in England and Wales: debtor advice, debtor education and the credit environment","bibo:abstract":"In July 2006 the Centre for Insolvency Law and Policy (CILP),  Kingston Law School, Kingston University, received £20,000 research funding to undertake the current research project, Personal Insolvency Law in England and Wales: Debtor Advice, Debtor Education and the Credit Environment. The funding was provided by the Insolvency Service, an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry and Grant Thornton LLP, a leading accountancy firm. \r\n\r\nThe project was originally scheduled to report in February 2007. It now reports in July 2008, to take into account the logistical difficulties faced in corresponding and in arranging meetings with creditors and debt advice and solution providers. For workaday purposes the project was christened PIP, after Personal Insolvency Project. This acronym will be used throughout this report. \r\n\r\nThe project, as originally proposed consisted of three elements highlighted by the ‘Bankruptcy Courts Survey 2005’ (BCS)  as warranting further investigation. These consisted of: (1) an examination of the role of IVA firms in the insolvency advice market; (2) the holding of a number of free personal finance management workshops, the holding of three Credit Responsibility Days, the creating of a Credit Responsibility Pack, an examination of pre and post bankruptcy petition education; and (3) an examination of bank lending practices to consumer debtors.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to the poor uptake of the personal finance management workshops, it was decided that the Credit Responsibility Days would be postponed. The Centre is currently continuing the pilot workshops with a view to eventually into holding the proposed Credit Responsibility Days. As the main source of marketing for the Credit Responsibility Days, the Credit Responsibility Pack will not be trialled in local branches of high-street banks until suitable dates for the event have been finalised. A follow up report will be presented once completed in early 2008.  \r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis Personal Insolvency Project (PIP) research report is divided into three parts and two volumes. The three substantive parts are set out in Volume I and relate to the research areas of: (1) debtor advice, (2) debtor education, and, (3) the credit environment. Volume II contains all of the appendices pertinent to the three sections and the bibliography.\r\n\r\nThe three areas that are examined in this report first came to the fore as points for consideration following the publication of the BCS. It was concluded following that report that a further investigation into areas impacting on personal insolvency should be investigated. This report is a further investigatory exercise. In essence, the major participants in the personal insolvency arena and the causes of the recent upsurge in personal insolvency usage were to be investigated, thus hopefully resolving the extremely important question of: what or who is responsible for the recent upsurge in insolvency procedure usage? This question, inter alia, has been addressed within this report.\r\n\r\nThe three report sections include, inter alia, an examination of the advice function and general practices of debt solution companies (Part I), and an examination of the attitudes, procedures and approach of major credit providers to the law of insolvency (Part III). A resounding theme from the BCS was the lack of financial literacy amongst the respondents. As there has hitherto been a lacuna in English insolvency scholarship regarding debtor education it was decided that this should be addressed (Part II). There are obvious synergies between the three parts of the report. These are discussed in the main body and conclusions.  \r\n\r\nThe general abstracted conclusions of the PIP research can be seen in the following graphical representation of main findings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tribe, John","Cocks, Leyanda"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90635,"sim:weight":0.698573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90196,"sim:weight":0.52125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71990,"sim:weight":0.420827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108643,"sim:weight":0.403967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.335234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99043,"sim:weight":0.319233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.318995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.315025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26138,"sim:weight":0.310312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106153,"sim:weight":0.298068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46839,"sim:weight":0.271353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.271342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73198,"sim:weight":0.271277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.260368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112506,"sim:weight":0.256376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.255069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352201,"sim:weight":0.252524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.250286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81098,"sim:weight":0.250173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.247479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper seeks to explore this issue by\r\nproviding a causal-explanatory account of how the UK early music musician labour\r\nmarket emerged in the early 1970s. This is developed through the application of\r\nArcherâ��s Morphogenetic Approach, which recognises a stratified and transformational\r\nsocial ontology. It is argued that the resulting analysis takes account of the dynamic and\r\ntransitory nature of the labour market, thus emphasising the need to re-think the concept\r\nin terms of structures and the actions of agents, rather than structures alone. As such, the\r\ninterdependency of labour market, firm, and market, through the mediation of human\r\nagency, is highlighted.

The aims of this study were to investigate supplement use, identify groups of athletes with high levels of supplement use and the prevalence of concomitant use of supplements. METHODS: Survey data from 847 high-performing athletes in the UK were analysed using descriptive statistics. The survey, conducted by UK Sport, consisted of questions regarding knowledge of the prohibited substances, testing procedure, nutritional supplement use and perceptions of the doping problem. The proportion of supplement users and the relative use of each supplement were compared by age, gender and professional status. RESULTS: Among 874 high-performing athletes in the UK sample, 58.8% of them reported the use of at least one nutritional supplement. Among supplement users, 82.6% used more than one and 11.5% reported use of more than five nutritional supplements. Of the 9 supplements listed, multivitamins (72.6%) and vitamin C (70.7%) were used most, followed by creatine (36.1%), whey protein (31.7%), echinacea (30.9%), iron (29.9%) and caffeine (23.7%). Less than 11% reported the use of magnesium or ginseng. Creatine use was typically associated with males regardless of status and across all ages, whereas iron was characteristically used by females. A \u0027typical\u0027 supplement user is male, between 24 and 29 years of age, involved in professional sport and using a combination of supplements. Male professional players between age 30 and 34 years, and female non-professional athletes between 24 and 29 years of age also represented a considerable proportion of supplement users. Athletes older than 40 years of age were practically non-users. Concomitant use of supplements is characteristic of male users more than females. CONCLUSION: As supplement use has been previously shown to increase the probability of prohibited substance use, groups exhibiting high use of nutritional supplements should be monitored. Future research should incorporate a wide range of supplements and enquire about the daily amount ingested. In addition to tutoring, preventive measures should incorporate offering acceptable and healthy alternatives for assisted performance enhancement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petróczi, Andrea","Naughton, Declan P."],"dc:date":"2008-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90253,"sim:weight":0.774055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90249,"sim:weight":0.768968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1523994,"sim:weight":0.764558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90246,"sim:weight":0.755862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90134,"sim:weight":0.375486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85266,"sim:weight":0.296321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337792,"sim:weight":0.233542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.212767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86101,"sim:weight":0.211625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.206631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.201917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.197175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.195234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.195234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177000,"sim:weight":0.194221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.185846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.185283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.181497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.181232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.168497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

METHODS: The \u0027UK Sport 2005 Drug Free Survey\u0027 data (n \u003d 874) were re-analysed using association [chi2] and \u0027strength of association\u0027 tests [phi], to discover observed incongruencies between self-reported supplement use and the underlying motives. Results are given for test pairs between \u0027motive for use\u0027 [doctor\u0027s advice, avoiding sickness, overcoming injuries and enhancement of diet] and each supplement used and these were categorized as strong (phi \u003e .7), intermediate (7 \u003c phi \u003e .3) and weak (phi \u003c .3). RESULTS: The use of selected supplements varied widely as follows: multivitamin (72.7%), vitamin C (70.4%), echinacea (30.8%), iron (29.8%), magnesium (11.0%) and ginseng (8.3%). Associations with motive were found in 8 of the 10 test pairs which were expected from literature precedents, however only weak associations exist. Of these, four were associated with avoidance of sickness [iron (chi2 \u003d 11.94, p \u003c .001; phi \u003d .15, p \u003d .001), multivitamin (chi2 \u003d 6.43, p \u003c .001; phi \u003d .11, p \u003d .011), vitamin C (chi2 \u003d 54.67, p \u003c .001; phi \u003d .32, p \u003c .001) and echinacea (chi2 \u003d 40.34, p \u003c .001; phi \u003d .28, p \u003c .001)]. The remaining 4 associations were: no time to prepare meals with ginseng (chi2 \u003d 7.64, p \u003d .006; phi \u003d .12, p \u003d .006) and multivitamin (chi2 \u003d 9.103, p \u003d .003; phi \u003d .13, p \u003d .003); overcoming injuries with magnesium (chi2 \u003d 6.99, p \u003d .008; phi \u003d .11, p \u003d .008); doctors\u0027 advice and iron (chi2 \u003d 35.00, p \u003c .001; phi \u003d .25, p \u003d .001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest a lack of understanding regarding supplements and health maintenance, except for vitamin C and echinacea. Furthermore, supplement use is apparently independent of physicians/dieticians\u0027 advice, except for iron. This may suggest a widespread circumvention of expert advice in the growing area of supplement use and therefore should be addressed to underscore potential health risks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petroczi, Andrea","Naughton, Declan P.","Mazanov, Jason","Holloway, Allison","Bingham, Jerry"],"dc:date":"2007-10-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Petroczi, Naughton DP, J Mazanov, A Holloway and J Bingham.

HYPOTHESIS: A frequent divergence between the type of supplements chosen by athletes and the rationale dictating the supplement use is hypothesized. Thus, a potentially dangerous incongruence may exist between rationale and practice. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: In the continued absence of reliable data on supplement use, an alternative approach of studying the reasons underlying supplement use in athletes is proposed to determine whether there is an incongruence between rationale and practice. Existing data from large scale national surveys can be used to investigate this incongruence. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: In this report, analyses of distinctive patterns between the use and rationale for use of supplements among athletes are recommended to explore this potentially dangerous phenomenon.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petróczi, Andrea","Naughton, Declan"],"dc:date":"2007-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90246,"sim:weight":0.818541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90249,"sim:weight":0.811239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1523994,"sim:weight":0.802271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90243,"sim:weight":0.774055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90262,"sim:weight":0.507478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.244338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.241649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.236953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.236647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.23369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.227931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.227931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.225306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.20851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.198584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177273,"sim:weight":0.187293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There have been studies suggesting a role in affecting growth and invasiveness of malignant breast cells by either blocking or stimulating growth of cultured MCF-7 breast cancer cells. This effect may be mediated by induction of COX-2. Aspirin is an inhibitor of COX-2 and has been implicated, with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) in prevention and treatment of breast cancer. In this study the in vitro effects of IL-1 and aspirin on growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells was examined. METHODS: MCF-7 cells were treated with various concentrations of IL-1 and aspirin alone and in combination. Cell growth was assessed by cell number measurement. RESULTS: Aspirin significantly decreased growth rate in a dose-dependent manner, alone and as a combined treatment with IL-1 with a maximum reduction in growth rate at 300 mg/ml (P \u003c 0.05). Treatment with IL-1 alone showed no significant effect on growth rate of MCF-7 cells (P \u003e 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study confirms that aspirin suppresses the proliferation rate of MCF-7 cells both as a single agent and in combination with IL-1. It also suggests that IL-1 alone does not stimulate or inhibit growth of MCF-7 cells.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sali, Paula","Jewell, Andrew Paul"],"dc:date":"2006-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23815,"sim:weight":0.44438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99432,"sim:weight":0.377365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931557,"sim:weight":0.348144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99262,"sim:weight":0.306644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.275994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99242,"sim:weight":0.249191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98860,"sim:weight":0.228018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.179528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.179234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.178508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.178375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040471,"sim:weight":0.171301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.16854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.16629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23816,"sim:weight":0.165745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.161427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338053,"sim:weight":0.143927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.140495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387003,"sim:weight":0.131111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23977,"sim:weight":0.129464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Practitioners in the School of Surveying at Kingston University have been running such a scheme for first-year undergraduates since 1990 (Author 2003) and have recently undertaken a research project into perceptions of PAL by both attendees and mentors. Case study methodology (Tellis 1997) was the chosen research design for the evaluation in which data from focus groups, interviews, and student questionnaires were collected and analysed.\r\nThe results support much of the previous literature related to PAL/SI schemes, but also highlight gaps which this study may begin to fill. Student perceptions appeared to be clustered into two groups: those who used PAL as a means of managing a comprehension problem (reactive) that had arisen and those that used it as a means of preventing problems (proactive). Additionally, PAL mentors also fell into two groups: those who elected to become mentors for other-centred reasons and those who did so for personal gain. The findings show that both PAL attendees and mentors perceived a number of benefits from the scheme and that local lessons were learned that enabled the School of Surveying to better support its undergraduate students.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Judy","May, Steve","Burke, Linda"],"dc:date":"2007-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.38768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.37811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.372211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.37182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.364787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573448,"sim:weight":0.364385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.346945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.340015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99108,"sim:weight":0.33396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.323762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.308884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98881,"sim:weight":0.306158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.276128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.269515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.233163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We propose a generative model that creates a one-to-many mapping from an idealized “identity” space to the observed data space. In identity space, the representation for each individual does not vary with pose. We model the measured feature vector as being generated by a pose-contingent linear transformation of the identity variable in the presence of Gaussian noise. We term this model “tied” factor analysis. The choice of linear transformation (factors) depends on the pose, but the loadings are constant (tied) for a given individual. We use the EM algorithm to estimate the linear transformations and the noise parameters from training data. \r\nWe propose a probabilistic distance metric that allows a full posterior over possible matches to be established. We introduce a novel feature extraction process and investigate recognition performance by using the FERET, XM2VTS, and PIE databases. Recognition performance compares favorably with contemporary approaches.","bibo:AuthorList":["Prince, Simon J.D.","Elder, James H.","Warrell, Jonathan","Felisberti, Fatima M."],"dc:date":"2008-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1147229,"sim:weight":0.602478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21427,"sim:weight":0.552264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147453,"sim:weight":0.543452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22898,"sim:weight":0.529171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385215,"sim:weight":0.483515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":240751,"sim:weight":0.455276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18442,"sim:weight":0.421674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.339193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.332274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997523,"sim:weight":0.324063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the experience in some of these\r\ncountries has also shown that entrepreneurship in\r\nthese contexts remains fragile and its contributions\r\nto economic development rather small.\r\nIn this respect, government is one of the main\r\nactors in establishing the necessary institutional\r\narrangements for durable development or productive\r\nentrepreneurship in post communist economies.\r\nMoreover, variations between countries in\r\ngovernment policies and actions contribute to\r\nheterogeneous external conditions and variations\r\nin patterns of entrepreneurial behaviour and outcomes.\r\nBased on institutional theories, we explore the\r\ncomparative roles of the Estonian and Albanian\r\ngovernments in shaping paths of entrepreneurial\r\ndevelopment in these two post communist economies.\r\nUsing a combination of documentary and\r\nsurvey data we show that government can be both\r\nan enabling and constraining influence through\r\nthe establishment of regulatory environments,\r\nthe increased legitimacy of their policies and also\r\nthrough the role that is placed on entrepreneurship\r\nin societies where entrepreneurship has had a short\r\nhistory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Xheneti, Mirela","Smallbone, David"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383656,"sim:weight":0.221668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":510627,"sim:weight":0.216965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":567731,"sim:weight":0.194324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931559,"sim:weight":0.190578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383011,"sim:weight":0.185621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47598,"sim:weight":0.180955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352124,"sim:weight":0.172254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45399,"sim:weight":0.171716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.168694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.165061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96213,"sim:weight":0.162792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":361620,"sim:weight":0.162762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96216,"sim:weight":0.156359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387372,"sim:weight":0.155174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96215,"sim:weight":0.153869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99191,"sim:weight":0.137115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383597,"sim:weight":0.133654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47133,"sim:weight":0.123965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47461,"sim:weight":0.123068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387422,"sim:weight":0.118905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They are also important at times of food shortage. This paper discusses issues concerning wild food use in semiarid West Africa, and presents the results of a study of the use of wild plant foods in northeast Nigeria. Interviews with farmers and herders identified a total of 67 wild foods, coming from 53 species of plant. Knowledge of wild foods varied according to ethnic group and gender. Some wild foods caused side effects if eaten in excess. Land-use change due to agricultural expansion seems to be increasing the areas where wild foods are most commonly found. Wild foods are important as a supplement to daily diet, and at times of food scarcity. In addition, they provide an opportunity to generate income when they are collected and traded. The paper concludes that wild foods are an important coping strategy for rural communities. Further research is needed to determine whether local institutions and community-based natural resource management regimes are sufficient to conserve this resource.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harris, Frances M.

More specifically, firstly the theoretical arguments for a strictly quantitative, more restrictive view of CA vs. a broader, more qualitative view are considered, followed by a brief discussion on the two main types of CA approaches in the literature, index vs. volumetric studies. Then a review of the literature on the sampling, context and recording/coding units of CA is conducted. The discussion moves on to assessing the use of several classification attempts employed in the literature. With regards to coding, sentences along with derived page size data are suggested as an equally valid approach to the proportion of pages one, whilst with regards to the classification attempts, three particular distinctions, one on symbolic vs. substantive CSD and two thematic ones, are proposed as being able to make the use of CA in the CSR research more meaningful.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vourvachis, Petros"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90459,"sim:weight":0.679964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.639499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.561413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85702,"sim:weight":0.515513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1144710,"sim:weight":0.506122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48416,"sim:weight":0.468656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109146,"sim:weight":0.464988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734375,"sim:weight":0.464018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108914,"sim:weight":0.45302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.444661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387243,"sim:weight":0.431278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.430424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98465,"sim:weight":0.399922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.396168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.385224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.374636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99383,"sim:weight":0.372908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.372776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.370184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340559,"sim:weight":0.370016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The empirical and theoretical literature relating to dignity is extensive and as likely to confound and confuse as to clarify the meaning of dignity for nurses in practice. The aim of this paper is critically to examine the literature and to address the following questions: What does dignity mean? What promotes and diminishes dignity? And how might dignity be operationalised in the care of older people?This paper critically reviews the theoretical and empirical literature relating to dignity and clarifies the meaning and implications of dignity in relation to the care of older people. If nurses are to provide dignified care clarification is an essential first step. METHODS: This is a review article, critically examining papers reporting theoretical perspectives and empirical studies relating to dignity. The following databases were searched: Assia, BHI, CINAHL, Social Services Abstracts, IBSS, Web of Knowledge Social Sciences Citation Index and Arts \u0026 Humanities Citation Index and location of books a chapters in philosophy literature. An analytical approach was adopted to the publications reviewed, focusing on the objectives of the review. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We review a range of theoretical and empirical accounts of dignity and identify key dignity promoting factors evident in the literature, including staff attitudes and behaviour; environment; culture of care; and the performance of specific care activities. Although there is scope to learn more about cultural aspects of dignity we know a good deal about dignity in care in general terms. CONCLUSION: We argue that what is required is to provide sufficient support and education to help nurses understand dignity and adequate resources to operationalise dignity in their everyday practice. Using the themes identified from our review we offer proposals for the direction of future research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gallagher, Ann","Li, Sarah","Wainwright, Paul","Jones, Ian Rees","Lee, Diana"],"dc:date":"2008-07-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.399018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.393153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334784,"sim:weight":0.380789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.36193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341217,"sim:weight":0.354236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.349577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382009,"sim:weight":0.340584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.336576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.335769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.327199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.323617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.318371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45202,"sim:weight":0.314865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.314783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.299187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.297266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.295313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.291394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316057,"sim:weight":0.271254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.267026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Capturing the complexity of these attitudes beyond verbal declarations requires indirect methods. This pilot study was aimed at developing and validating a method to assess implicit doping attitudes using an Implicit Associations Test (IAT) approach. METHODS: The conventional IAT evaluation task (categorising \u0027good\u0027 and \u0027bad\u0027 words) was combined with a novel \u0027doping\u0027 versus \u0027nutrition supplements\u0027 category pair to create a performance-enhancement related IAT protocol (PE-IAT). The difference between average response times to \u0027good-doping\u0027 and \u0027bad-doping\u0027 combinations represents an estimate of implicit attitude towards doping in relation to nutritional supplements. 111 sports and exercise science undergraduates completed the PE-IAT, the Performance Enhancement Attitude Scale (PEAS) and answered questions regarding their beliefs about doping. RESULTS: Longer response times were observed in the mixed category discrimination trials where categories \u0027good\u0027 and \u0027doping\u0027 shared the same response key (compared to \u0027bad-doping\u0027 combination on the same key) indicating a less favourable evaluation of doping substances. The PE-IAT measure did not correlate significantly with the declared doping attitudes (r \u003d .181, p \u003d .142), indicating a predictable partial dissociation. Action-oriented self-report expressed stronger associations with PE-IAT: participants who declared they would consider using doping showed significantly less implicit negativity towards banned substances (U \u003d 109.00, p \u003d .047). Similarly, those who reported more lenient explicit attitudes towards doping or expressly supported legalizing it, showed less implicit negativity towards doping in the sample, although neither observed differences reached statistical significance (t \u003d 1.300, p \u003d .198, and U \u003d 231.00, p \u003d .319, respectively). Known-group validation strategy yielded mixed results: while competitive sport participants scored significantly lower than non-competitive ones on the PEAS (t \u003d -2.71, p \u003d .008), the two groups did not differ on PE-IAT (t \u003d -.093, p \u003d .926). CONCLUSION: The results suggest a potential of the PE-IAT method to capture undeclared attitudes to doping and predict behaviour, which can support targeted anti-doping intervention and related research. The initial evidence of validity is promising but also indicates a need for improvement to the protocol and stimulus material.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petroczi, Andrea","Aidman, Eugene V","Nepusz, Tamas"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1539442,"sim:weight":0.691402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91239,"sim:weight":0.6866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90134,"sim:weight":0.645433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90262,"sim:weight":0.592489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539253,"sim:weight":0.500677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69860,"sim:weight":0.382273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":245586,"sim:weight":0.35393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26758,"sim:weight":0.31269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.259629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.238078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.237875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.211572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.200721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23524,"sim:weight":0.200695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.199583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.19886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.19886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50132,"sim:weight":0.192359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.188917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387062,"sim:weight":0.187358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Based on proxy measures for the FAT components, participants were classified being \u0027at risk\u0027 or \u0027not at risk\u0027 and nutrition knowledge scores were compared for the two groups. Formal education related to nutrition was considered. RESULTS: A considerably higher percentage of athletes were classified \u0027at risk\u0027 of menstrual dysfunction than controls (28.8% and 9.4%, respectively) and a higher percentage scored at or above the cutoff value of 20 on the EAT-26 test among athletes than controls (10.2% and 3.1%, respectively). 8.5% of athletes were classified \u0027at risk\u0027 for bone mineral density in contrast to none from the control group. Nutrition knowledge and eating attitude appeared to be independent for both athletes and controls. GNKQ scores of athletes were higher than controls but the differences between the knowledge of \u0027at risk\u0027 and \u0027not at risk\u0027 athletes and controls were inconsequential. Formal education in nutrition or closely related subjects does not have an influence on nutrition knowledge or on being classified as \u0027at risk\u0027 or \u0027not at risk\u0027. CONCLUSION: The lack of difference in nutrition knowledge between \u0027at risk\u0027 and \u0027not at risk\u0027 athletes suggests that lack of information is not accountable for restricted eating associated with the Female Athlete Triad.","bibo:AuthorList":["Raymond-Barker, Philippa","Petroczi, Andrea","Quested, Eleanor"],"dc:date":"2007-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":929191,"sim:weight":0.483823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9430574,"sim:weight":0.474879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23524,"sim:weight":0.278513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335847,"sim:weight":0.258115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337792,"sim:weight":0.251106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98634,"sim:weight":0.247369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336130,"sim:weight":0.24265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333361,"sim:weight":0.239451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.238837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.230729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337284,"sim:weight":0.225907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.218459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.216884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.215954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.208547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040471,"sim:weight":0.199064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.18917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25774,"sim:weight":0.18648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is possible to explore one specific example as an illustration and vehicle for this discussion. In multi-ethnic Britain, citizenship and national identity have become important issues. Things once taken for granted have become a matter of public concern and debate. Specifically, \u0027What is Britishness\u0027? is a question that has concerned government departments and agencies, educationalists - and the current British Prime Minister for some time.\r\nThis general and abstract discussion has relevance for the role and work of teachers, especially for those where citizenship education and global thinking are declared governmental policy. So, all teachers, certainly British ones, whether involved in teaching citizenship or not, must consider the evolving national identity in the context of globalization and their concomitant values about diversity and cosmopolitanism that they embody as being part of their professional identity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, Helen"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.480631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44868,"sim:weight":0.457581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.448298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.447506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.386459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.383488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.372642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381933,"sim:weight":0.254551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9046992,"sim:weight":0.179342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As such, the presence of this element can directly control the expression of adjacent genes. Previous work has shown differences in regulation of gene expression between neisserial strains and species due to the presence of a CREE. These interruptions perhaps remove the expression of CREE-associated genes from ancestral neisserial regulatory networks.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Analysis of the chromosomal locations of the CREE in Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain FA1090 and N. gonorrhoeae strain NCCP11945 has revealed that most of the over 120 copies of the element are conserved in location between these genome sequences. However, there are some notable exceptions, including differences in the presence and sequence of CREE 5\u0027 of copies of the opacity protein gene opa, differences in the potential to bind IHF, and differences in the potential to be cleaved by RNase III.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: The presence of CREE insertions in one strain relative to the other, CREE within a prophage region, and CREE disrupting coding sequences, provide strong evidence of mobility of this element in N. gonorrhoeae. Due to the previously demonstrated role of these elements in altering transcriptional control and the findings from comparing the two gonococcal genome sequences, it is suggested that regulatory differences orchestrated by CREE contribute to the differences between strains and also between the closely related yet clinically distinct species N. gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria lactamica.","bibo:AuthorList":["Snyder, Lori A.S.","Cole, Jeff A.","Pallen, Mark J."],"dc:date":"2009-02-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90605,"sim:weight":0.481327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90609,"sim:weight":0.374777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90584,"sim:weight":0.364306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90602,"sim:weight":0.338913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90589,"sim:weight":0.33348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48914,"sim:weight":0.307723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1438135,"sim:weight":0.217918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.189213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90586,"sim:weight":0.186723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47380,"sim:weight":0.178817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44283,"sim:weight":0.1721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44537,"sim:weight":0.151865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99431,"sim:weight":0.149684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46554,"sim:weight":0.149376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.148701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.141066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48977,"sim:weight":0.139329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.137281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98866,"sim:weight":0.137159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44276,"sim:weight":0.136063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The process of liquid droplet break-up has been modeled using the Blob model for primary break-up and the cascade atomization breakup (CAB) and the\r\nReitz and Diwakar breakup (RDB) models for secondary break-up. The results show that the predicted water droplet coverage and the blade temperature drop were in good agreement with experimental measurements.\r\nSimulations also showed that for the two water pump pressures considered, the water droplet coverage and\r\ndistribution patterns on the blade ring change little, indicating the need to increase the number of injectors for better water washing performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yao, Jun","Yao, Yufeng","Mason, Peter","Zhang, Tao","Heyes, F.

Indeed, several studies have reported an enhanced memory for faces of cheaters, although other studies failed to find any biases. To investigate in more detail possible memory biases for faces in social exchanges, pictures of faces (XM2VTS database) were grouped according to a brief history of cooperation, cheating or irrelevant behaviour towards a hypothetical person. Observers (n\u003d 180) had to: (i) memorise 3 sets of 6 faces with their moral status, (ii) complete a distracter task in the memory retention period, followed by the (iii) detection of any familiar face in a crowd of unfamiliar faces. Observers showed higher accuracy and lower reaction times for faces associated with an acquired history of cooperation rather than cheating or irrelevant behaviour. Enhanced memory for cooperators was also found with single stimulus presentations. Accuracy for faces of cooperators presented to the left visual field was higher than for faces presented to the right visual field. Our results are consistent with Singer and colleagues (2008)* and poit to a good ability to remember cooperators, even when time allowed for memorisation and/or retrieval was limited. Since cooperation and cheating are usually conflicting behaviours, an efficient detection of cooperators is vital to the strengthening of social exchanges. \r\n\r\n*Singer, T, Kiebel, SJ, Winston, JS, Dolan, RJ, \u0026 Frith, CD (2004).

In contrast to elsewhere in Europe, where the project of modernism effectively developed through post-modernism, the UK saw at the close of the 70s its destruction, cemented in the early 1980s by the rise of Thatcherism, the public interventions of Prince Charles and the unequivocal assumption of semantics in architectural design.\r\n\r\nThis paper will address the decline of post-war architectural modernism in the 1970s, using as a case study the treatment in the media of the innovative public housing project at Alexandra Road in Camden.  A high-density but low-rise development, constructed largely from pre-cast and insitu fair-faced concrete, the project was vilified in the national and specialist press for its technical and social failings, and more particularly for going spectacularly over budget.  The formal and abstract language of the scheme subsequently became almost entirely unacceptable, with the proviso that the architectural assistants on the project (Benson and Forsyth) went on to design in similar vein such ï¿½elitistï¿½ buildings as the National Gallery of Scotland.\r\n \r\nThe project will be reassessed in the light of more general and ongoing debates about ï¿½the estateï¿½, the nature of intellectual life in the UK, the question of patrician architecture, and questions of social determinism in architectural design.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gough, Timothy","Forster, Laurel","Harper, Sue"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382083,"sim:weight":0.255401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382031,"sim:weight":0.249682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.22178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382003,"sim:weight":0.22165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.197307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383665,"sim:weight":0.196917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312663,"sim:weight":0.194916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98616,"sim:weight":0.18778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44433,"sim:weight":0.187635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.186225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383607,"sim:weight":0.18294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45306,"sim:weight":0.181312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44515,"sim:weight":0.165782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44140,"sim:weight":0.16184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929836,"sim:weight":0.154904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99117,"sim:weight":0.138486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383642,"sim:weight":0.12974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.124468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Neither is it clear that this is merely the last stance of an outmoded ontology.  It will be asserted that the physicality and materiality of the archaeologist - the exemplary materialist - is, after all, more virtual than virtuality \u0027itself\u0027; and the impulses which allow the conventionally virtual to work effectively also give place for a more extreme materialist \u0027virtuality\u0027.\r\n\r\nClearly this assertion only makes sense spoken from a situation where our perfection is characterised as something like care.  Care, here, is both:\r\n~\tthat which allows our curatorial aspect to occur\r\n~\tthat \u0027idea\u0027 evinced through the history of concrete acts of curatorship, widely defined\r\n\r\nThis paper will take as a clue to this experience of care the recent (and unique) curatorial strategy at Matt\u0027s Gallery, East London.  The gallery, a low-value rented space, consists of two large columnated warehouse-type rooms, each with windows along one wall.  Each exhibition is curated primarily by the artist themselves, with some collaboration with the gallery owner or other curators.  Whilst an exhibition is proceeding in one of the spaces, the artist has three months to work in the adjacent space to bring the exhibition to the time of the opening.  Exhibitions rhythmically move from one space to the other.  We will remark particularly on those artists, for instance, Nelson, Robertson, Gunning, who work with the space in such a way as to project the curatorship, by means of an extended notion of \u0027installation\u0027, into the time of the exhibition itself.  They do this, it will be argued, by calling on those who come to these spaces themselves to curate - to care -  in participatory fashion.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown:\r\n~ that this curatorial experience has analogies in respect of the built environment\r\n~ how this might impact on the in situ curation of cities and places\r\n~ and how display and the museological imagination is caught in an everyday and not-so-everyday curation of urban and other places\r\n\r\nFinally, the paper will outline how this curatorship of the city and architecture affects and effects time.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gough, Tim","Chaplin, Sarah","Stara, Alexandra"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":88573,"sim:weight":0.407628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313483,"sim:weight":0.288073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.266933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.266704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.261581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.254393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.243164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.218758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.208342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313628,"sim:weight":0.208041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382030,"sim:weight":0.196995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98801,"sim:weight":0.169801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47545,"sim:weight":0.144584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Famously, all identities are renounced in the name on the one hand of a Nietzschean differences of force and on the other in the name of particularities.  Identities are, at the limit, derived and constructed from difference, and difference is defined in itself as pure difference, not in relation to the same.  Thus in Deleuzeï¿½s interpretation, the eternal return of the same speaks not of the return of something identical with what came before, but return as the generation of what we call the same.  The same ï¿½is said ofï¿½ difference, just as ï¿½univocal Being [God, self] is said of beings which are not univocalï¿½ (1990, 300).\r\n\r\nThus Deleuze questions the great historic division of philosophy between on the one hand the pre-enlightenment centring of the infinite divine being and, on the other, the Kantian substitution of it by the finite self.  For the self can only exist by virtue of God, and in this respect the enlightenment fools itself as to its own true footing:\r\n\r\n\tAs long as we maintain the formal identity of the self, doesnï¿½t the self remain subject to a divine order, and to a unique God who is its foundation?  Klossowski insists that God is the sole guarantor of the identity of the self and of its substantive baseï¿½ One cannot conserve the self without also holding onto God (294)\r\n\r\nSubsequent to this deconstruction, in what way does Deleuzeï¿½s distinction between the differentiation of the Idea and the differenciation of its actualisation inform the construction of, or ï¿½saying ofï¿½, identities; and what implications does this have for a post-humanist, post-subject thought?  It will be argued that it is not a question simply of discarding the subject or the human, and in that sense ï¿½manï¿½ must remains a universal concern.  However, Deleuzeï¿½s logic, in a similar way to the supplementary logic of Derrida, implies that the locus of the ï¿½universalï¿½ would be displaced from its pretensions as implying a grounding  principle, a measure of all measures.   It would instead feature as constant accompaniment ï¿½ perhaps of the nature of a friend; as one of those ideas that remains universally within the field of investigation, but not as archÃ© to that field.\r\n\r\nAs we know, this strategy is not more profound than humanism and the philosophy of the subject.  On the contrary, it reverts to the surface of which Deleuze speaks throughout The Logic of Sense (see particularly 4-11).

{"identifier":90684,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Inoculation of data","bibo:abstract":"David Velleman, in his paper How we get along (2007), quotes Blackburn on a limitation of analytical moral philosophy in respect of ï¿½the social as a determining feature of individual action and motivationï¿½ (Ruling Passions, 1998).  This is in accordance with the phenomenon that a positionï¿½s strengths are generally much the same as its supposed weaknesses: to proceed in analytic fashion, in moral philosophy as elsewhere, is to focus on the particular, the dissolving or breaking-down of issues (Greek: analuein).  This strength on the part of analytic philosophy tends to discourage the question of the social (as a subset, we could say, of all holistic questions, and such phenomena as existentialism, gestalt psychology etc).  In this respect, we may consider that the question of the identity of the individual, particularly in respect of technology and new media, is not only one which lends itself effectively to an analytic approach (given the structural consonance between the particular and the individual), but that this question will only have become both possible and significant in the modern era, post-Descartes.  In other words, we posit a feedback mechanism, a movement to-and-fro, operating through time, history and tradition, between philosophy, the possibilities it opens up, and the ways in which society ï¿½expressesï¿½ itself (via politics, law, institutions, technology), its concerns and its members.  Now, within the analytical philosophy of this movement, the social does not at all disappear; rather, its analysis is generally and necessarily located after the positing and analysis of the individual and the particular.  Thus the importance of disciplines such as psychology, that is, disciplines which, on the basis of the particular, look at connections between those particulars.  For instance, David Shoemaker will state (in Reductionist Contractualism 2000), ï¿½I have very good reasonsï¿½. for cultivatingï¿½ justifiability to all other selves with whom I am psychologically connected, given that they are, in a very real sense, extensions of me.ï¿½  Here, the self, the individual, comes first in the analysis, to be followed by the question of how this self becomes or is connected.  By contrast, avowedly holistic and anti-Cartesian discourses such as existentialism (most notoriously, Heideggerï¿½s starting-point of Dasein) will tend to avoid positing individuals prior to ï¿½the wholeï¿½ (however this is characterised) and will therefore not include psychological issues within their ambit.  Of course, in each case, the starting point will be in some way overturned; Dasein retains an inevitably individualistic tone; Shoemaker states elsewhere by means of modus tollens (in The Irrelevance/incoherence of non-reductionism about personal identity 2002) that ï¿½[i]t is not the case that questions of identity will always have determinate answers.  Thus, we are not separately existing entities.ï¿½\r\n\r\nThis paper will suggest a systems approach to the question of ethics, the production of identity and the question of the ï¿½selfï¿½ in respect of information technology; this is, the issue of the feedbacks occurring between thought (in all its guises), the possibilities opened by it, technology, law and politics will be foregrounded.  Digital computers and their associated databases, as particular phenomena, can only be established, improved and in themselves correctly understood by means of analytical research; this does not necessarily rule out a non-analytic approach in respect of their encompassing ï¿½ecologyï¿½.  The systems-approach to the ecology of databases will in this paper have an eye to such post-Nietzschian thought as that of Deleuze (in Difference and Repetition) and Derrida (in Différance 1967), in the sense that both start from the idea and experience of difference from which any concept of identity or sameness will come to be derived.  Identity is constructed, in a ecological and hyper-mobile system of thought, law, politics and information technology.\r\n\r\nHow, alongside (not contra) other approaches, might this inherently ambiguous enterprise help clarify ethical issues?\r\n\r\nï¿½\tthe specifics of individual cultures will be noted.  Currently, the UK government is proceeding with development of a universal database of its residents, linked to an identity card supposedly guaranteed by biometric data (fingerprints, iris scansï¿½).  In a country with no tradition of identity cards - the very suggestion has only been possible in an atmosphere of ï¿½war on terrorï¿½ - this endeavour has an ethical and political meaning different to other European states, and provides an example of how politicians can, by manipulating terminology (in this case, of ï¿½warï¿½, since the only precedent in the UK for identity cards was the second world war) achieve technical results\r\nï¿½\tsimilarly, the project of a universal UK health-care database, accessible in principle at all health-service locations and potentially by hundreds of thousands of individuals (including non-health-case professionals) is justified on broad technical grounds ï¿½ that is, the more efficient use of state healthcare funds and the better care of patients.  It is becoming increasingly clear that any digital database is per se vulnerable to inappropriate revelation, viz the recent loss of CD-ROMs with financial and identity details of 7 million children from the UK tax authorities.  Politicians claim incorrectly that this vulnerability is a technical question amenable to technical (IT security) solutions; in fact, it is an ecological (and thus properly political) question relating to the human-centred environment in which the data is used.  It is therefore per se not possible to protect against such security breaches by means of a technical solution.  But in respect of health-care information, the status of the press, the privacy laws governing what it can reveal (and therefore how it can make its money) vary from state to state (compare the UK with France) and thus the ethic import of the necessary possibility of such security breaches will tend to vary.  Similarly in the interaction with other fields such as insurance\r\n\r\nThe paper will hypothesise a structural (arguably ethical and political) law in respect of these issues.  This law states that in order for the development of technologically-driven databases relating to citizens to proceed, the data collected must necessarily be ï¿½inoculatedï¿½, that is, made relatively innocuous compared to the dataï¿½s previous status in a particular society.  Since IT security is no defense against the dataï¿½s release, there will inevitably be a tendency for the data to become or be made ï¿½worthlessï¿½ ï¿½ which will be a structural, not-get-roundable defense.

These breaths of pure intensity have the same character as the Nietzschian ï¿½relations of forceï¿½  playing within and against one another which Deleuze had earlier invoked in Nietzsche and Philosophy  and Difference and Repetition ; and it is indeed Klossowskiï¿½s interpretation of Nietzscheï¿½s eternal return, from his 1957 lecture  through to his book Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle  (dedicated in the exergue ï¿½to Gilles Deleuzeï¿½), which drives the movement within this nexus of texts.\r\n\r\nThese are evil spirits or evil breaths ï¿½ that is, evil to the prevailing philosophical/political order .  These evil breaths have of themselves no being, no existence, but are instead pure intensities defined only in their difference to one another - this not in a privative sense, not in the sense that they somehow lack being; but rather in the sense that they ï¿½areï¿½ prior to any notion of being, fixity or origin. In the same way, these breaths/spirits have no identity; they have no ï¿½selfï¿½, and as such, they are ï¿½ says Deleuze ï¿½ ï¿½of the order of the Antichristï¿½ in that they are the destruction and death of God.  Deleuze questions the great historic division of philosophy between on the one hand the pre-enlightenment centring of the infinite divine being and, on the other, the Kantian substitution of it by the finite self.  For the self can only exist by virtue of God:\r\n\r\n\tAs long as we maintain the formal identity of the self, doesnï¿½t the self remain subject to a divine order, and to a unique God who is its foundation?

As such, it exists in the intense play of difference and the eternal return of the same ï¿½ which means for Deleuze (following Klossowski) not the return of the identical but the effect of primary difference.\r\n\r\nThus architecture, thought outside the classical bind, can never be the translation of an apparently formal aspect of philosophy (the fold, for instance) into the form of architecture.  Rather, as is said of art in Ozenfant/Jeanneretï¿½s Purism manifesto, architecture raises space to the level of mathesis, and it does this as a genesis, as a development of the Idea by virtue of the process of differentiation (of the Idea as problem) and differenciation (of the actualisation of this) ï¿½ ï¿½by posing the question of its own differenceï¿½(195).  This genesis is a creative ï¿½triple genesisï¿½ of qualities, space and time, and concepts (173); thus architecture, as such a creative movement, does not follow concepts but rather generates them.  A truly conceptual architecture does not begin, but ends, with the concept; and we can thus understand how it would be that philosophy, as conceptual, must perforce rely on the architectonic plan.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown, in conclusion, that architecture will therefore stay true to Deleuzeï¿½s thought (in Logic of Sense) of the Event as that ï¿½battle which hovers over its own fieldï¿½. neutral in relation to its temporal actualisationsï¿½ all the more terrible.ï¿½ (100)","bibo:AuthorList":["Gough, Tim"],"dc:date":"2008-08-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46600,"sim:weight":0.50947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352227,"sim:weight":0.491834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45196,"sim:weight":0.487759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381931,"sim:weight":0.477115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352130,"sim:weight":0.474463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47164,"sim:weight":0.446675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44229,"sim:weight":0.44396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352169,"sim:weight":0.428457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47100,"sim:weight":0.418646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99237,"sim:weight":0.409812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44313,"sim:weight":0.409365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46627,"sim:weight":0.403101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44499,"sim:weight":0.397349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46625,"sim:weight":0.39231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386225,"sim:weight":0.381147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47281,"sim:weight":0.378147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.375438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99288,"sim:weight":0.373441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48384,"sim:weight":0.368921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88942,"sim:weight":0.366096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This severity bias can have serious consequences for the well-being of patients. We argue that the bias is due to a misconception of the pragmatic function served by the expression of probability. The more severe the condition, the greater the chance that the listener construes the expression as a politeness marker rather than as an uncertainty marker. When this misconception does not occur, neither should the severity bias. An analysis of interpretations of probability expressions using a membership-function approach validates this account.

The discussion of these results will focus on implications for the understanding of speakersï¿½ choices of verbal probability phrases and for risk-framing in legal contexts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Juanchich, Marie","Villejoubert, Gaelle","Taatgen, N.","van Rijn, H.","Schomaker , L.","Nerbonne , J."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48892,"sim:weight":0.237273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":633105,"sim:weight":0.190718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":633088,"sim:weight":0.167674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48414,"sim:weight":0.158427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47101,"sim:weight":0.144166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18196,"sim:weight":0.124702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99469,"sim:weight":0.124336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931311,"sim:weight":0.120416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386691,"sim:weight":0.115623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387333,"sim:weight":0.115554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573546,"sim:weight":0.113968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47373,"sim:weight":0.0982549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.0962943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99137,"sim:weight":0.0677735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We argue that there is another communicative function which has yet to be documented, namely, the facemanagement function. Such function consists in mitigating threat to the addressee when x is a criticism or\r\nan imposition. Data show that the phrases ï¿½possiblyï¿½ and ï¿½probablyï¿½ are indeed understood differently (have different membership functions) depending on whether they modify neutral or face-threatening contents. We consider the potential misunderstandings and judgmental mistakes that may arise from ambiguity about which function of verbal uncertainty is being performed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bonnefon, Jean-Francois","Villejoubert, Gaelle","Bara, B.G.","Barsalou, L.","Bucciarelli , M."],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":633105,"sim:weight":0.228519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17959,"sim:weight":0.225538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387406,"sim:weight":0.219427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387392,"sim:weight":0.199968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47212,"sim:weight":0.195776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99120,"sim:weight":0.191605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18196,"sim:weight":0.188844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.188282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387303,"sim:weight":0.186625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387333,"sim:weight":0.181105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.181067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99396,"sim:weight":0.172812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26288,"sim:weight":0.147661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":90766,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Network analytical tool for monitoring global food safety highlights China","bibo:abstract":"BACKGROUND: The Beijing Declaration on food safety and security was signed by over fifty countries with the aim of developing comprehensive programs for monitoring food safety and security on behalf of their citizens. Currently, comprehensive systems for food safety and security are absent in many countries, and the systems that are in place have been developed on different principles allowing poor opportunities for integration. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have developed a user-friendly analytical tool based on network approaches for instant customized analysis of food alert patterns in the European dataset from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. Data taken from alert logs between January 2003-August 2008 were processed using network analysis to i) capture complexity, ii) analyze trends, and iii) predict possible effects of interventions by identifying patterns of reporting activities between countries. The detector and transgressor relationships are readily identifiable between countries which are ranked using i) Google\u0027s PageRank algorithm and ii) the HITS algorithm of Kleinberg. The program identifies Iran, China and Turkey as the transgressors with the largest number of alerts. However, when characterized by impact, counting the transgressor index and the number of countries involved, China predominates as a transgressor country. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study reports the first development of a network analysis approach to inform countries on their transgressor and detector profiles as a user-friendly aid for the adoption of the Beijing Declaration. The ability to instantly access the country-specific components of the several thousand annual reports will enable each country to identify the major transgressors and detectors within its trading network. Moreover, the tool can be used to monitor trading countries for improved detector/transgressor ratios.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nepusz , Tamás","Petroczi, Andrea","Naughton, Declan P."],"dc:date":"2009-08-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.228488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.222197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.222197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.216883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.215374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.215374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.212718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.210147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.207307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.191696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29886,"sim:weight":0.177634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145770,"sim:weight":0.171423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26159,"sim:weight":0.168023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43391,"sim:weight":0.162667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.0963064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One cannot therefore understand the profile of the party militants ï¿½ their ideological entrenchment, their almost maniacal defence of their own identity, their sort of closed-mindedness towards the outer world, their permanent cult of the myth of Mussolini ï¿½ without due consideration of the period going from 8th September 1943 up to the party foundation on 26th December 1946, during which Mussoliniï¿½s followers had to face the armistice, the civil war, the republican experience, clandestine activity, the problems of veterans in the post-war period and the burden of being Fascist in a country willing to repudiate its recent past. This historical transition, marked by mixed feelings of loyalty, loneliness and revenge, would indeed mould the neo-Fascist people and ideals. Hence the present reconstruction, strictly focused on those who refused to betray the Duce and joined the SalÃ² republic, and inspired by the assumption that those eventful years were to influence the MSI more than any other party of the reborn Italian democracy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mammone, Andrea"],"dc:date":"2005-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47461,"sim:weight":0.279937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382032,"sim:weight":0.239373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381993,"sim:weight":0.228821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99294,"sim:weight":0.221394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.220411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48365,"sim:weight":0.214235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46582,"sim:weight":0.207517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23497,"sim:weight":0.199695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46762,"sim:weight":0.174888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387177,"sim:weight":0.172027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47177,"sim:weight":0.169073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15475,"sim:weight":0.16818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99370,"sim:weight":0.159162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18003,"sim:weight":0.15863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47545,"sim:weight":0.155431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.15301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47230,"sim:weight":0.147746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29202,"sim:weight":0.146037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999498,"sim:weight":0.110903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383318,"sim:weight":0.103159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These two dimensions of embodied experience, on one hand, and historically conditioned meaning on the other, have remained in varying degrees of tension and harmony at the heart of architectural making. \r\n\r\nContemporary architecture faces a great challenge in the quest for a relevant, meaningful and ethical practice, at a time when the perceived division between dimensions of existence seems to be at its most extreme. Phenomenology and hermeneutics are gaining ground as an intellectual framework and sensibility for addressing and reconciling this division. This paper will discuss the work of two young British practices that represent a discernible trend in worldwide architecture, towards such an encompassing and conciliatory praxis.\r\n\r\nLynch Architects and Dow Jones Architects have been working consistently within a phenomenological background since their formation, both within the last decade. Although they have different ways of engaging with site, program and technique ï¿½ with focus alternating between the poetic potential of tectonics to the historicity of type and form ï¿½ they share an understanding of their practice as poetic disclosure of space, making place for inhabitation and encounter, firmly grounded in the obscured yet enduring continuity of tradition.

However some of its herbal constituents, specifically Radix bupleuri, Radix scutellariae and Rhizoma alismatis have been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Thus, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of LD on cancer cells in vitro. METHODS: HL60 and HT29 cancer cell lines were exposed to water extracts of LD (1:10, 1:50, 1:100 and/or 1:1000 prepared from a 3 mg/30 ml stock) and for both cell lines growth, apoptotic induction, alterations in cell cycle characteristics and genotoxicity were investigated. The specificity of the action of LD on these cancer cell lines was also investigated by determining its effect on human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Preliminary chemical analysis was carried out to identify cytotoxic constituents of LD using HPLC and LCMS. RESULTS: LD was significantly cytotoxic to, and induced apoptosis in, both cell lines. Apoptotic induction appeared to be cell cycle independent at all concentrations of LD used (1:10, 1:50 and 1:100) for the HL60 cell lines and at 1:10 for the HT29 cell line. At 1:50 and 1:100 apoptotic induction by LD appeared to be cell cycle dependent. LD caused significant genotoxic damage to both cell lines compared to their respective controls. The specificity study showed that LD exerted a moderate cytotoxic action against non-proliferating and proliferating blood lymphocytes but not apoptosis. Chemical analysis showed that a number of fractions were found to exert a significant growth inhibitory effect. However, the molecular weights of compounds within these fractions did not correspond to those from the herbal constituents of LD. CONCLUSION: It is possible that LD may have some chemotherapeutic potential. However, further studies are required to determine its cytotoxic constituents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Willimott, Shaun","Barker, James","Jones, Lucy A","Opara, Elizabeth I"],"dc:date":"2009-09-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99171,"sim:weight":0.344065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.321499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.302259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.295585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.233259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.233171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.229082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.222313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.214666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.20967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.208276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.201132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.192427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.186402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.182537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.177955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44075,"sim:weight":0.172538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98669,"sim:weight":0.151621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386803,"sim:weight":0.130386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23818,"sim:weight":0.119302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

METHODS: The anti-ageing and anti-oxidant properties of 23 plant extracts (from 21 plant species) were assessed as anti-elastase and anti-collagenase activities and in selected anti-oxidant assays along with phenolic content. RESULTS: Anti-elastase activities were observed for nine of the extracts with inhibitory activity in the following order: white tea (approximately 89%), cleavers (approximately 58%), burdock root (approximately 51%), bladderwrack (approximately 50%), anise and angelica (approximately 32%). Anti-collagenase activities were exhibited by sixteen plants of which the highest activity was seen in white tea (approximately 87%), green tea (approximately 47%), rose tincture (approximately 41%), and lavender (approximately 31%). Nine plant extracts had activities against both elastase (E) and collagenase (C) and were ranked in the order of white tea (E:89%, C:87%) \u003e bladderwrack (E:50%, C:25%) \u003e cleavers (E:58%, C:7%) \u003e rose tincture (E:22%, C:41%) \u003e green tea (E:10%: C:47%) \u003e rose aqueous (E: 24%, C:26%) \u003e angelica (E:32%, C:17%) \u003e anise (E:32%, C:6%) \u003e pomegranate (E:15%, C:11%).Total phenolic content varied between 0.05 and 0.26 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/mL with the exception of white tea (0.77 mg GAE/mL). For anti-oxidant assessment, the Trolox equivalent anti-oxidant capacity (TEAC) assay revealed activity for all extracts. White tea had the highest activity equivalent to approximately 21 microM Trolox for a 6.25 microg aliquot. In addition, seven extracts exhibited activities \u003d 10 microM Trolox with witch hazel (6.25 microg \u003d 13 microM Trolox) and rose aqueous (6.25 microg \u003d 10 microM Trolox) showing very high activities at low concentrations. A high activity for white tea was also found in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay in which it exhibited ~88% inhibition of reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium. High activities were also observed for green tea (86.41%), rose tincture (82.77%), witch hazel (82.05%) and rose aqueous (73.86%). CONCLUSION: From a panel of twenty three plant extracts, some one dozen exhibit high or satisfactory anti-collagenase or anti-elastase activities, with nine having inhibitory activity against both enzymes. These included white tea which was found to have very high phenolic content, along with high TEAC and SOD activities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thring, Tamsyn S A","Hili, Pauline","Naughton, Declan P"],"dc:date":"2009-08-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":777319,"sim:weight":0.358871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":779243,"sim:weight":0.316089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1041170,"sim:weight":0.280833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5700547,"sim:weight":0.264448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1037672,"sim:weight":0.263619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2835560,"sim:weight":0.248233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18949,"sim:weight":0.248233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.240134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.240134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.23926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.232454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2673154,"sim:weight":0.226612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":827773,"sim:weight":0.216521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.203658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.201536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75818,"sim:weight":0.197763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.191922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631793,"sim:weight":0.189987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.180932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76743,"sim:weight":0.177398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

METHODS: This report describes the antimicrobial activities of pomegranate rind extract (PRE) singularly and in combination with cupric sulphate against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA respectively), and Panton-Valentine Leukocidin positive community acquired MSSA (PVL positive CA-MSSA). RESULTS: PRE alone showed limited efficacy against MRSA and MSSA strains. Exposure to copper (II) ions alone for 2 hours resulted in moderate activity of between 102 to 103 log10 cfu mL-1 reduction in growth. This was enhanced by the addition of PRE to 104 log10 cfu mL-1 reduction in growth being observed in 80% of the isolates. However, the PVL positive CA-MSSA strains were more sensitive to copper (II) ions which exhibited moderate activities of between 103 log10 cfu mL-1 reduction in growth for 60% of the isolates. CONCLUSION: PRE, in combination with Cu(II) ions, was seen to exhibit moderate antimicrobial effects against clinical isolates of MSSA, MRSA and PVL positive CA-MSSA isolates. The results of this study indicate that further investigation into the active ingredients of natural products, their mode of action and potential synergism with other antimicrobial agents is warranted.

{"identifier":91070,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Nitric oxide production by Biomphalaria glabrata haemocytes: effects of Schistosoma mansoni ESPs and regulation through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway","bibo:abstract":"BACKGROUND: Schistosoma mansoni uses Biomphalaria glabrata as an intermediate host during its complex life cycle. In the snail, the parasite initially transforms from a miracidium into a mother sporocyst and during this process excretory-secretory products (ESPs) are released. Nitric oxide (NO) and its reactive intermediates play an important role in host defence responses against pathogens. This study therefore aimed to determine the effects of S. mansoni ESPs on NO production in defence cells (haemocytes) from schistosome-susceptible and schistosome-resistant B. glabrata strains. As S. mansoni ESPs have previously been shown to inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation (activation) in haemocytes from susceptible, but not resistant, B. glabrata the regulation of NO output by ERK in these cells was also investigated. RESULTS: Haemocytes from resistant snails challenged with S. mansoni ESPs (20 mug/ml) over 5 h displayed an increase in NO production that was 3.3 times greater than that observed for unchallenged haemocytes; lower concentrations of ESPs (0.1-10 mug/ml) did not significantly increase NO output. In contrast, haemocytes from susceptible snails showed no significant change in NO output following challenge with ESPs at any concentration used (0.1-20 mug/ml). Western blotting revealed that U0126 (1 muM or 10 muM) blocked the phosphorylation (activation) status of ERK in haemocytes from both snail strains. Inhibition of ERK signalling by U0126 attenuated considerably intracellular NO production in haemocytes from both susceptible and resistant B. glabrata strains, identifying ERK as a key regulator of NO output in these cells. CONCLUSION: S. mansoni ESPs differentially influence intracellular NO levels in susceptible and resistant B. glabrata haemocytes, possibly through modulation of the ERK signalling pathway. Such effects might facilitate survival of S. mansoni in its intermediate host.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zahoor, Zahida","Davies, Angela J","Kirk, Ruth S","Rollinson, David","Walker, Anthony J"],"dc:date":"2009-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1028078,"sim:weight":0.329969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336912,"sim:weight":0.206126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":601111,"sim:weight":0.196642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43577,"sim:weight":0.174594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":245699,"sim:weight":0.150982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98707,"sim:weight":0.147912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.134543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.134216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.130004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.125074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.124651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.12255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.120731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.119508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.118381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.118327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99284,"sim:weight":0.117736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.116787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.113109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.112961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this study is to measure the levels of metal ions found in selected beverages (red wine, stout and apple juice) and to determine their potential detrimental effects via calculation of the Target Hazard Quotients (THQ) for 250 mL daily consumption. RESULTS: The levels (mean +/- SEM) and diversity of metals determined by ICP-MS were highest for red wine samples (30 metals totalling 5620.54 +/- 123.86 ppb) followed by apple juice (15 metals totalling 1339.87 +/- 10.84 ppb) and stout (14 metals totalling 464.85 +/- 46.74 ppb). The combined THQ values were determined based upon levels of V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb which gave red wine samples the highest value (5100.96 +/- 118.93 ppb) followed by apple juice (666.44 +/- 7.67 ppb) and stout (328.41 +/- 42.36 ppb). The THQ values were as follows: apple juice (male 3.11, female 3.87), stout (male 1.84, female 2.19), red wine (male 126.52, female 157.22) and ultra-filtered red wine (male 110.48, female 137.29). CONCLUSION: This study reports relatively high levels of metal ions in red wine, which give a very high THQ value suggesting potential hazardous exposure over a lifetime for those who consume at least 250 mL daily. In addition to the known hazardous metals (e.g. Pb), many metals (e.g. Rb) have not had their biological effects systematically investigated and hence the impact of sustained ingestion is not known.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hague, Theresa","Petroczi, Andrea","Andrews, Paul LR","Barker, James","Naughton, Declan P"],"dc:date":"2008-06-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":89926,"sim:weight":0.653195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9599570,"sim:weight":0.616039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.219611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.212569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.212569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.191772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.191772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.191577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.165317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.164057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.161327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25848,"sim:weight":0.160701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.156839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.153675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.150124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.141323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.138095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.130682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040471,"sim:weight":0.123606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44075,"sim:weight":0.117707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The algorithm performs an adaptive sphericity oriented contrast region growing on the fuzzy connectivity map of the object of interest. This region growing is operated within a volumetric mask which is created by first applying a local adaptive segmentation algorithm that identifies foreground and background regions within a certain window size. The foreground objects are then filled to remove any holes, and a spatial connectivity map is generated to create a 3-D mask. The mask is then enlarged to contain the background while excluding unwanted foreground regions. Apart from generating a confined search volume, the mask is also used to estimate the parameters for the subsequent region growing, as well as for repositioning the seed point in order to ensure reproducibility. The method was run on 815 pulmonary nodules. By using randomly placed seed points, the approach was shown to be fully reproducible. As for acceptability, the segmentation results were visually inspected by a qualified radiologist to search for any gross miss-segmentation. 84% of the first results of the segmentation were accepted by the radiologist while for the remaining 16% nodules, alternative segmentation solutions that were provided by the method were selected.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dehmeshki, Jamshid","Amin, Hamdan","Valdivieso, Manlio","Ye, Xujiong"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Dehmeshiki, H Amin and M Valdivieso.

However within developed society sedentary work and inflexible working hours promotes physical inactivity. Consequently to ensure a healthy workforce there is a requirement for exercise strategies adaptable to occupational time constraint. This study examined the effect of a 12 week aerobic exercise training intervention programme implemented during working hours on the cardiovascular profile of a sedentary hospital workforce. METHODS: Twenty healthy, sedentary full-time staff members of the North West London Hospital Trust cytology unit were randomly assigned to an exercise (n \u003d 12; mean +/- SD age 41 +/- 8 years, body mass 69 +/- 12 kg) or control (n \u003d 8; mean +/- SD age 42 +/- 8 years, body mass 69 +/- 12 kg) group. The exercise group was prescribed a progressive aerobic exercise-training programme to be performed 4 times a week for 8 weeks (initial intensity 65% peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak)) and to be conducted without further advice for another 4 weeks. The control was instructed to maintain their current physical activity level. Oxygen economy at 2 minutes (2minVO2), 4 minutes (4minVO2), VO2 peak, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), BMI, C-reactive protein (CRP), fasting glucose (GLU) and total cholesterol (TC) were determined in both groups pre-intervention and at 4 week intervals. Both groups completed a weekly Leisure Time Questionnaire to quantify additional exercise load. RESULTS: The exercise group demonstrated an increase from baseline for VO2 peak at week 4 (5.8 +/- 6.3 %) and 8 (5.0 +/- 8.7 %) (P \u003c 0.05). 2minVO2 was reduced from baseline at week 4 (-10.2 +/- 10.3 %), 8 (-16.8 +/- 10.6 %) and 12 (-15.1 +/- 8.7 %), and 4minVO2 at week 8 (-10.7 +/- 7.9 %) and 12 (-6.8 +/- 9.2) (P \u003c 0.05). There was also a reduction from baseline in CRP at week 4 (-0.4 +/- 0.6 mg.L-1) and 8 (-0.9 +/- 0.8 mg.L-1) (P \u003c 0.05). The control group showed no such improvements. CONCLUSION: This is the first objectively monitored RCT to show that moderate exercise can be successfully incorporated into working hours, to significantly improve physical capacity and cardiovascular health.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hewitt, Jennifer A","Whyte, Gregory P","Moreton, Michelle","Van Someren, Ken A","Levine, Tanya S"],"dc:date":"2008-02-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99057,"sim:weight":0.457598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.439643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23873,"sim:weight":0.439643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49216,"sim:weight":0.431686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387164,"sim:weight":0.376917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.302934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.301506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.286057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.277051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.268203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.254278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.248742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.248712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9995,"sim:weight":0.24568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.240071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.229521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.221109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26489,"sim:weight":0.216479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25865,"sim:weight":0.203991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46324,"sim:weight":0.197514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Trypanosomes and/or babesiosomes occurred in 20/32 blood smears, and morphometric analysis of trypanosomes from 13/32 smears showed features suggestive of T. mukasai, including nuclear indices consistently \u003e1. In 16/32 blood lysate samples from which DNA was extracted, trypanosome DNA was detected in 12/16 by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), using trypanosome-specific ssu rRNA gene primers. Two samples positive for trypanosomes in blood smears yielded no amplifiable trypanosome DNA, but 4 samples with no detectable infection in blood smears were positive for trypanosome DNA, suggesting an overall trypanosome prevalence rate of 17/32 (53%) among fishes and demonstrating the value of PCR in trypanosome recognition. Cloning and sequencing of the 12 amplified fragments revealed 2 genotypic groups among these fish trypanosomes. Group 1 trypanosomes were from cichlids and 3 families of catfishes, Group 2 from 2 types of catfishes. Sequence comparison showed that the consensus Group 1 sequence was most similar to that of Trypanosoma cobitis, representing European fish trypanosomes of the carassii type, while the consensus Group 2 sequence showed similarity with a trypanosome sequence from another African catfish, Clarias angolensis. It was concluded that the identification of T. mukasai remains a problem, but at least 2 genotypic groups of trypanosomes occur in Okavango Delta fishes, and catfishes in this region appear to contain both types.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Angela J.","Gibson, Wendy","Ferris, Vanessa","Basson, Linda","Smit, Nico J."],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91572,"sim:weight":0.632876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47352,"sim:weight":0.199267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.191278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98876,"sim:weight":0.182514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.181737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.180823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.168922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98941,"sim:weight":0.165121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46554,"sim:weight":0.157392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.156818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.156818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.156577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.152895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.144554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384221,"sim:weight":0.143807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99351,"sim:weight":0.13877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":267462,"sim:weight":0.137737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44149,"sim:weight":0.137148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59935,"sim:weight":0.128237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98669,"sim:weight":0.125487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We designed the first national clinical audits of occupational health care in England. We chose to audit depression and back pain as health care workers have high levels of both conditions compared with other employment sectors.  The aim of the audits was to drive up quality of care for staff with these conditions. The object of this paper is to describe how we developed an audit methodology and overcame challenges presented by the organisation and delivery of occupational health care for NHS staff.  \r\n\r\n(ii) Method \r\nWe designed two retrospective case note audits which ran simultaneously.   Sites submitted up to 40 cases for each audit.  We used duplicate case entry to test inter-rater reliability and performed selection bias checks. Participants received their siteï¿½s audit results, benchmarked against the national average, within four months of the end of the data entry period. We used electronic voting at a results dissemination conference to inform implementation activities.\r\n\r\n(iii) Results\r\nOccupational Health departments providing services to 278 (83%) trusts in England participated in one or both audits. Median Kappa scores were above 0.7 for both pilot and full audits, indicating ï¿½goodï¿½ levels of inter-rater reliability. \r\n79% of participants at a dissemination conference said that they had changed their clinical practice either during data collection (52%) or following receipt of their audit results (27%).      \r\n\r\n(iv) Conclusions \r\nClinical audit can be conducted successfully in the occupational health setting. We obtained meaningful data that has stimulated local and national quality improvement activities. Our methodology would be transferable to occupational health settings outside the NHS and in other countries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, S","Rogers, CA","Peel, P","Harvey, SB","Henderson, M","Madan, I","Smedley, J","Grant, Robert"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.267596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":217785,"sim:weight":0.245354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":217872,"sim:weight":0.245354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99063,"sim:weight":0.240471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90683,"sim:weight":0.233586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.228172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.21479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.162053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.161825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.158015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There is increasing recognition, however, of a group of acidotic patients who have a large anion gap that is not explained by either keto- or lactic acidosis nor, in most cases, is inappropriate fluid resuscitation or ingestion of exogenous agents the cause.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nPlasma ultrafiltrate from patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, acidosis of unknown cause, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, or acidosis as a result of base loss were examined enzymatically for the presence of low molecular weight anions including citrate, isocitrate, ?-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate and d-lactate. The results obtained from the study groups were compared with those obtained from control plasma from normal volunteers.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nIn five patients with lactic acidosis, a significant increase in isocitrate (0.71 ± 0.35 mEq l-1), ?-ketoglutarate (0.55 ± 0.35 mEq l-1), malate (0.59 ± 0.27 mEq l-1), and d-lactate (0.40 ± 0.51 mEq l-1) was observed. In 13 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, significant increases in isocitrate (0.42 ± 0.35 mEq l-1), ?-ketoglutarate (0.41 ± 0.16 mEq l-1), malate (0.23 ± 0.18 mEq l-1) and d-lactate (0.16 ± 0.07 mEq l-1) were seen. Neither citrate nor succinate levels were increased. Similar findings were also observed in a further five patients with high anion gap acidosis of unknown origin with increases in isocitrate (0.95 ± 0.88 mEq l-1), ?-ketoglutarate (0.65 ± 0.20 mEq l-1), succinate (0.34 ± 0.13 mEq l-1), malate (0.49 ± 0.19 mEq l-1) and d-lactate (0.18 ± 0.14 mEq l-1) being observed but not in citrate concentration. In five patients with a normal anion gap acidosis, no increases were observed except a modest rise in d-lactate (0.17 ± 0.14 mEq l-1).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe levels of certain low molecular weight anions usually associated with intermediary metabolism were found to be significantly elevated in the plasma ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with metabolic acidosis. Our results suggest that these hitherto unmeasured anions may significantly contribute to the generation of the anion gap in patients with lactic acidosis and acidosis of unknown aetiology and may be underestimated in diabetic ketoacidosis. These anions are not significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis.\r\n© 2005 Forni et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","bibo:AuthorList":["Forni, Lui G","McKinnon, William","Lord, Gwyn A","Treacher, David F","Peron, Jean-Marie R","Hilton, Philip J"],"dc:date":"2005-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.297345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.28475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.246562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98568,"sim:weight":0.213313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.197183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.192333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.184626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.184215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.171385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.166911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98765,"sim:weight":0.162352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.158209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.147008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44075,"sim:weight":0.143361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.133698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23977,"sim:weight":0.133698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387191,"sim:weight":0.122415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25913,"sim:weight":0.116175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18039,"sim:weight":0.114728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22728,"sim:weight":0.114532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":91126,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"An alternative methodology for the prediction of adherence to anti HIV treatment","bibo:abstract":"BACKGROUND: Successful treatment of HIV-positive patients is fundamental to controlling the progression to AIDS. Causes of treatment failure are either related to drug resistance and/or insufficient drug levels in the blood. Severe side effects, coupled with the intense nature of many regimens, can lead to treatment fatigue and consequently to periodic or permanent non-adherence. Although non-adherence is a recognised problem in HIV treatment, it is still poorly detected in both clinical practice and research and often based on unreliable information such as self-reports, or in a research setting, Medication Events Monitoring System caps or prescription refill rates. To meet the need for having objective information on adherence, we propose a method using viral load and HIV genome sequence data to identify non-adherence amongst patients. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: With non-adherence operationally defined as a sharp increase in viral load in the absence of mutation, it is hypothesised that periods of non-adherence can be identified retrospectively based on the observed relationship between changes in viral load and mutation. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Spikes in the viral load (VL) can be identified from time periods over which VL rises above the undetectable level to a point at which the VL decreases by a threshold amount. The presence of mutations can be established by comparing each sequence to a reference sequence and by comparing sequences in pairs taken sequentially in time, in order to identify changes within the sequences at or around \u0027treatment change events\u0027. Observed spikes in VL measurements without mutation in the corresponding sequence data then serve as a proxy indicator of non-adherence. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: It is envisaged that the validation of the hypothesised approach will serve as a first step on the road to clinical practice. The information inferred from clinical data on adherence would be a crucially important feature of treatment prediction tools provided for practitioners to aid daily practice. In addition, distinct characteristics of biological markers routinely used to assess the state of the disease may be identified in the adherent and non-adherent groups. This latter approach would directly help clinicians to differentiate between non-responding and non-adherent patients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thompson, Richard","Bidgood, Penelope","Petroczi, Andrea","Denholm-Price, James C.W.","Fielder, Mark D."],"dc:date":"2009-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.325737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9046025,"sim:weight":0.319844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22728,"sim:weight":0.312643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.303341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.287895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.272014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.243195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.241796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.241426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.230122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.223032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.223032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.208766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.19677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29886,"sim:weight":0.194604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.189069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2745396,"sim:weight":0.166007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.158209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.150828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We hypothesized that elevated levels of neurokinin B may be an indicator of pre-eclampsia and that treatment with certain neurokinin receptor antagonists may be useful in alleviating the symptoms. At the time of the original hypothesis many questions remained outstanding. These included - Does neurokinin B have any diagnostic value in the detection and diagnosis of pre-eclampsia? - What is the cause of the elevated levels of neurokinin B during pre-eclampsia? - What is the physiological significance of neurokinin B in the placenta? This review discusses the answers to these questions taking into account the subsequent developments of the past ten years and analyzing the plethora of discoveries that have arisen from those initial observations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Page, Nigel M"],"dc:date":"2010-01-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98536,"sim:weight":0.3494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18039,"sim:weight":0.302814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105102,"sim:weight":0.284475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631844,"sim:weight":0.256573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631717,"sim:weight":0.256487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77305,"sim:weight":0.248573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222958,"sim:weight":0.241701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75441,"sim:weight":0.241175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033596,"sim:weight":0.237408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.234501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.222388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76079,"sim:weight":0.217727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.212705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.19702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76149,"sim:weight":0.195866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.165616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.163587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.162341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.151154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.138926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this view, the potential to reduce poverty lies in the ability of the state to introduce appropriate forms of formality and the intrinsic abilities of markets to generate wealth. Pointing to evidence that the results of formalisation initiatives have been less impressive in practice, I argue that one of the reasons is a failure to analyse informal land markets in their own terms. Drawing on evidence from informal land markets in informal settlements in three of South Africaï¿½s metropolitan areas, I demonstrate how informal land markets can be seen in their own terms and the difference this makes to analysing their potential to reduce poverty.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marx, Colin"],"dc:date":"2009-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381989,"sim:weight":0.401932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.321228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.301445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.296967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383500,"sim:weight":0.291049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.289251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930888,"sim:weight":0.287203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.287135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387372,"sim:weight":0.284672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334809,"sim:weight":0.279029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.270723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.258833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45075,"sim:weight":0.2524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108611,"sim:weight":0.222916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734403,"sim:weight":0.215816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.207229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.126512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Taking its clue from an early written building contract, this paper discusses the role of the architect as agent in this light. On the one hand, the role of agent can be seen as a parasitical one, an unnecessary burden (financially and morally) on the ï¿½realï¿½ act of construction.

Looking behind self-declared innocence in doping","bibo:abstract":"BACKGROUND: Social science studies of doping practices in sport rely predominantly on self-reports. Studies of psychoactive drug use indicate that self-reporting is characterised by under-reporting. Likewise doping practice is likely to be equally under-reported, if not more so. This calls for more sophisticated methods for such reporting and for independent, objective validation of its results. The aims of this study were: i) to contrast self-reported doping use with objective results from chemical hair analysis and ii) to investigate the influence of the discrepancy on doping attitudes, social projection, descriptive norms and perceived pressure to use doping. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A doping attitudes questionnaire was developed and combined with a response latency-based implicit association test and hair sample analysis for key doping substances in 14 athletes selected from a larger sample (N \u003d 82) to form contrast comparison groups. Results indicate that patterns of group differences in social projection, explicit attitude about and perceived pressure to use doping, vary depending on whether the user and non-user groups are defined by self-report or objectively verified through hair analysis. Thus, self-confessed users scored higher on social projection, explicit attitude to doping and perceived pressure. However, when a doping substance was detected in the hair of an athlete who denied doping use, their self-report evidenced extreme social desirability (negative attitude, low projection and low perceived pressure) and contrasted sharply with a more positive estimate of their implicit doping attitude. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Hair analysis for performance enhancing substances has shown considerable potential in validating athletes\u0027 doping attitude estimations and admissions of use. Results not only confirm the need for improved self-report methodology for future research in socially-sensitive domains but also indicate where the improvements are likely to come from: as chemical validation remains expensive, a more realistic promise for large scale studies and online data collection efforts is held by measures of implicit social cognition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petroczi, Andrea","Aidman, Eugene V.","Hussain, Iltaf","Deshmukh, Nawed","Nepusz, Tamas","Uvacsek, Martina","Toth, Miklos","Barker, James","Naughton, Declan P."],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":89917,"sim:weight":0.700918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90504,"sim:weight":0.6866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539585,"sim:weight":0.685614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90262,"sim:weight":0.676685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539253,"sim:weight":0.598393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":245586,"sim:weight":0.446989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.232242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.212909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.211659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.206984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.172109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.168675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.167578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335847,"sim:weight":0.159865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337284,"sim:weight":0.132554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.0971865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51784,"sim:weight":0.0839127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":91242,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Potentially harmful advantage to athletes: a putative connection between UGT2B17 gene deletion polymorphism and renal disorders with prolonged use of anabolic androgenic steroids","bibo:abstract":"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With prolonged use of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), occasional incidents of renal disorders have been observed. Independently, it has also been established that there are considerable inter-individual and inter-ethnic differences, in particular with reference to the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 2B17 (UGT2B17) gene, in metabolising these compounds. This report postulates the association of deletion polymorphism in the UGT2B17 gene with the occurrence of renal disorders on chronic exposure to AAS. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The major deactivation and elimination pathway of AASs is through glucuronide conjugation, chiefly catalyzed by the UGT2B17 enzyme, followed by excretion in urine. Excretion of steroids is affected in individuals with a deletion mutation in the UGT2B17 gene. We hypothesize that UGT2B17 deficient individuals are more vulnerable to developing renal disorders with prolonged use of AAS owing to increases in body mass index and possible direct toxic effects of steroids on the kidneys. Elevated serum levels of biologically active steroids due to inadequate elimination can lead to prolonged muscle build up. An increase in body mass index may cause renal injuries due to sustained elevated glomerular pressure and flow rate. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: In the absence of controlled clinical trials in humans, observational studies can be carried out. Real time PCR with allelic discrimination should be employed to examine the prevalence of different UGT2B17 genotypes in patients with impaired renal function and AAS abuse. In individuals with the UGT2B17 deletion polymorphism, blood tests, biofluid analyses, urinalysis, and hair analyses following the administration of an anabolic steroid can be used to determine the fate of the substance once in the body. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: If the hypothesis is upheld, anabolic steroid users with a deletion mutation in the UGT2B17 gene may be exposed to an increased risk of developing renal disorders. In the current detecting - sanctioning anti-doping system, athletes motivated by the potential to evade detection owing to their unique genetic make-up could subject themselves to a serious health consequence. More research on AAS metabolism in the presence of UGT2B17 gene deletion is required. Benefit - harm evaluations in therapeutic use of anabolic steroids should also consider this potential link between UGT2B17 gene deletion polymorphism and renal disorders.","bibo:AuthorList":["Deshmukh, Nawed","Petroczi, Andrea","Barker, James","Szekely, Andrea D","Hussain, Iltaf","Naughton, Declan P"],"dc:date":"2010-04-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90262,"sim:weight":0.512228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.295169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.250013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.242192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.242192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24544,"sim:weight":0.216803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.216444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.216225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.216109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.206927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.20407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.203962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.196113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76351,"sim:weight":0.19345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76149,"sim:weight":0.193314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040474,"sim:weight":0.191265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.183425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.180622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.180094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76079,"sim:weight":0.178859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":91257,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The prevalence of neovascularity in patients clinically diagnosed with rotator cuff tendinopathy","bibo:abstract":"BACKGROUND: Shoulder dysfunction is common and pathology of the rotator cuff tendons and subacromial bursa are considered to be a major cause of pain and morbidity. Although many hypotheses exist there is no definitive understanding as to the origin of the pain arising from these structures. Research investigations from other tendons have placed intra-tendinous neovascularity as a potential mechanism of pain production. The prevalence of neovascularity in patients with a clinical diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinopathy is unknown. As such the primary aim of this pilot study was to investigate if neovascularity could be identified and to determine the prevalence of neovascularity in the rotator cuff tendons and subacromial bursa in subjects with unilateral shoulder pain clinically assessed to be rotator cuff tendinopathy. The secondary aims were to investigate the association between the presence of neovascularity and pain, duration of symptoms, and, neovascularity and shoulder function.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral rotator cuff tendinopathy referred for a routine diagnostic ultrasound (US) scan in a major London teaching hospital formed the study population. At referral patients were provided with an information document. On the day of the scan (on average, at least one week later) the patients agreeing to participate were taken through the consent process and underwent an additional clinical examination prior to undergoing a bilateral grey scale and colour Doppler US examination (symptomatic and asymptomatic shoulder) using a Philips HDI 5000 Sono CT US machine. The ultrasound scans were performed by one of two radiologists who recorded their findings and the final assessment was made by a third radiologist blinded both to the clinical examination and the ultrasound examination. The findings of the radiologists who performed the scans and the blinded radiologist were compared and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Twenty-six patients agreed to participate and formed the study population. Of these, 6 subjects were not included in the final assessment following the pre-scan clinical investigation. This is because one subject had complete cessation of symptoms between the time of the referral and entry into the trial. Another five had developed bilateral shoulder pain during the same period. The mean age of the 20 subjects forming the study population was 50.2 (range 32-69) years (SD \u003d 10.9) and the mean duration of symptoms was 22.6 (range .75 to 132) months (SD \u003d 40.1). Of the 20 subjects included in the formal analysis, 13 subjects (65%) demonstrated neovascularity in the symptomatic shoulder and 5 subjects (25%) demonstrated neovascularity in the asymptomatic shoulder. The subject withdrawn due to complete cessation of symptoms was not found to have neovascularity in either shoulder and of the 5 withdrawn due to bilateral symptoms; two subjects were found to have signs of bilateral neovascularity, one subject demonstrated neovascularity in one shoulder and two subjects in neither shoulder.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that neovascularity does occur in subjects with a clinical diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinopathy and to a lesser extent in asymptomatic shoulders. In addition, the findings of this investigation did not identify an association between the presence of neovascularity; and pain, duration of symptoms or shoulder function. Future research is required to determine the relevance of these findings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lewis, Jeremy S","Raza, Syed A","Pilcher, James","Heron, Christine","Poloniecki, Jan D"],"dc:date":"2009-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":922022,"sim:weight":0.553019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5471900,"sim:weight":0.541488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1094614,"sim:weight":0.524176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387114,"sim:weight":0.498366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.385325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17895,"sim:weight":0.372118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109129,"sim:weight":0.354079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5834568,"sim:weight":0.303287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91543,"sim:weight":0.280558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109023,"sim:weight":0.264702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99487,"sim:weight":0.263488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.259283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98479,"sim:weight":0.247989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26590,"sim:weight":0.242361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.233637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.230521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.227289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.22036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.217023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.216059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Anglo-Saxon polities, including the UK, have been in the vanguard of these developments. Writing from the UK, the author promotes the exercise of moral agency ï¿½ of praxis ï¿½ associated with upholding the ï¿½service ideal? in the face of these challenges.\r\nA good practice framework is presented identifying features a practitioner can demand of practice settings if they are to provide congruity between the realities of daily practice and the ï¿½service ideal?. This framework is the outcome of the author?s own reflective journey encompassing practice, practitioner research, management, academic study, teaching and writing. A UK Advanced Award in Social Work and PhD were staging posts in its formulation. It models cross-fertilisation of teaching, learning and practice: an exemplar for the integration of social work education in the world of practice.\r\nThe framework has four domains for appraising practice settings: regulatory context, values of practice, support and development of staff, knowledge creation. It is illustrated by ï¿½worked? examples from practice and research. The examples demonstrate tensions within the values, policy and practice dynamic, in which policy has become technocratic, instrumentalist and hostile to the ï¿½service ideal?. The author uses the examples to show how standards of moral agency may be actively sought by the practitioner in adverse circumstances.\r\nOur response to the modern environment challenges us to hone our understanding of what we mean by good practice and develop ethical practice because the global orthodoxy?s spectacular collapse in 2008-9 creates a space in which ethical discourse can acquire renewed influence in professional, political and economic debate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Elliott, Nigel"],"dc:date":"2010-06-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.445259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.402162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.393991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.390111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47362,"sim:weight":0.373349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.36878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.343619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.338456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45399,"sim:weight":0.331715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.306133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Studies addressing biases\r\nin face recognition have so far proved inconclusive, with reports of biases towards faces of cheaters,\r\nbiases towards faces of cooperators, or no biases at all. This work attempts to uncover possible\r\ncauses underlying such discrepancies.\r\nMethodology/ Findings: Four experiments were designed to investigate biases in face recognition\r\nduring social exchanges when behavioral descriptors (prosocial, antisocial or neutral) embedded in\r\ndifferent scenarios were tagged to faces during memorization. Face recognition, measured as\r\naccuracy and response latency, was tested with modified yes-no, forced-choice or recall tasks (N \u003d\r\n174). An enhanced recognition of faces tagged with prosocial descriptors was observed when the\r\nencoding scenario involved financial transactions and the rules of the social contract were not\r\nexplicit (experiments 1 and 2). Such bias could be eliminated or attenuated with priming and if\r\nparticipants were made explicitly aware of the moral status tagged to faces (ï¿½cooperatorsï¿½,\r\nï¿½cheatersï¿½ or ï¿½neutralsï¿½; experiment 3). Further, in a scenario describing a wide range of salient\r\nbehaviors, recognition of antisocial and prosocial faces was similar, but significantly better than\r\nneutral faces (experiment 4).\r\nConclusion: The results highlight the relevance of descriptors and scenarios of social exchange in\r\nface recognition, when the frequency of prosocial and antisocial individuals in a group is similar.\r\nRecognition biases towards prosocial faces emerged when descriptors did not state the rules of a\r\nsocial contract or the moral status of a behavior, and they point to the existence of broad and\r\nflexible cognitive abilities finely tuned to minor changes in social context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Felisberti, Fatima Maria","Pavey, Louisa"],"dc:date":"2010-05-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45942,"sim:weight":0.321461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87201,"sim:weight":0.290527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99474,"sim:weight":0.287405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.276934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.270423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.249983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.217719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.217719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9425239,"sim:weight":0.209406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.208501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334456,"sim:weight":0.205516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.201904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.198291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2745396,"sim:weight":0.151949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334296,"sim:weight":0.0768828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This information is important for the redesign of services. Methods Data on case mix, eligibility for thrombolysis, treatment and outcomes were extracted from the National Sentinel Stroke 2008 Audit dataset. This contains retrospective data on up to 60 consecutive stroke admissions from each acute hospital in England, Wales and Northern Ireland between 1 April and 30 June 2008. Findings All relevant hospitals participated, submitting data on 11 262 acute stroke patients. 2118 patients arrived within 2 h and 2596 within 3 h of the onset of symptoms and 587 people were already in hospital. Therefore, 28% (3183) were potentially eligible for thrombolysis based on a 3 h time criterion. Of these, 1914 were under 80 years and 2632 had infarction with 14% (1605) meeting all three National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke study criteria and so being potentially eligible for thrombolysis. If the time window is increased to 4.5 h then only another 2% became eligible. If the age limit was removed for treatment, the percentage potentially appropriate for tissue plasminogen activator increased to 23% within 3 h and 26% within 4.5 h. Overall, 1.4% (160) of patients were thrombolysed. Interpretation Thrombolysis rates are currently low in the UK. 14% of patients in this sample were potentially suitable for thrombolysis using the 3 h time window. This would only increase marginally if thrombolysis was extended to include those up to 4.5 h. The greatest impact on increasing the proportion of patients suitable for thrombolysis would be to increase the number of patients presenting early and by demonstrating that the treatment is safe and effective in patients over 80 years of age.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rudd, A G","Hoffman, A","Grant, R","Campbell, J T","Lowe, D"],"dc:date":"2011-01-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.354779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.340053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.333968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25874,"sim:weight":0.285985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24404,"sim:weight":0.285959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.270383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.262771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.255069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.246475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.231269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.230962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.222238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105295,"sim:weight":0.219741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.214279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.212283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.212283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.21095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99012,"sim:weight":0.205801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.20118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337046,"sim:weight":0.195712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

DESIGN: Observational study with follow-up to March 2008. SETTING: UK hospitals performing carotid endarterectomy. PARTICIPANTS: UK surgeons undertaking carotid endarterectomy from December 2005 to December 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Provision and speed of delivery of appropriate assessments of patients; carotid endarterectomy and operative mortality; 30 day postoperative mortality. RESULTS: 240 (61% of those eligible) consultant surgeons took part from 102 (76%) hospitals and trusts. Of 9913 carotid endarterectomies recorded on hospital episode statistics, 5513 (56%) were included. Of the patients who underwent endarterectomy, 83% had a history of transient ischaemic attack or stroke. Of these recently symptomatic patients, 20% had their operation within two weeks of onset of symptoms and 30% waited more than 12 weeks. Operative mortality was 0.5% during the inpatient stay and 1.0% (95% confidence interval 0.7% to 1.3%) by 30 days. CONCLUSION: Only 20% of symptomatic patients had surgery within the two week target time set by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Although operative mortality rates are comparable with those in other countries, some patients might experience disabling or fatal stroke while waiting for surgery and hence not be included in operative statistics. Major improvements in services are necessary to enable early surgery in appropriate patients in order to prevent strokes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Halliday, Alison W","Lees, Tim","Kamugasha, Dora","Grant, Robert","Hoffman, Alex","Rothwell, Peter M","Potter, John F","Horrocks, Michael","Naylor, Ross","Rudd, Anthony G"],"dc:date":"2009-06-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1114834,"sim:weight":0.429507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.338517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.297461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.297451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.270955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.251322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387164,"sim:weight":0.23785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.236313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.227313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99012,"sim:weight":0.216419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.213608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.205996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387196,"sim:weight":0.203671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.195494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.195494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.191972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.190942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105295,"sim:weight":0.183789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337803,"sim:weight":0.107017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177391,"sim:weight":0.0613597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

DESIGN: An economic evaluation using a Markov model and data from a systematic review was conducted. Estimates of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events were based on data from three large randomised controlled trials, and observational data were used for sensitivity analyses. Efficacy benefits from treatment were estimated from a meta-analysis of trials reporting total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index score. Other model inputs were obtained from the relevant literature. The model was run for a hypothetical population of people with osteoarthritis. Subgroup analyses were conducted for people at high risk of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular adverse events. Comparators Licensed COX 2 selective inhibitors (celecoxib and etoricoxib) and traditional NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen) for which suitable data were available were compared. Paracetamol was also included, as was the possibility of adding a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) to each treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was cost effectiveness, which was based on quality adjusted life years gained. Quality adjusted life year scores were calculated from pooled estimates of efficacy and major adverse events (that is, dyspepsia; symptomatic ulcer; complicated gastrointestinal perforation, ulcer, or bleed; myocardial infarction; stroke; and heart failure). RESULTS: Addition of a proton pump inhibitor to both COX 2 selective inhibitors and traditional NSAIDs was highly cost effective for all patient groups considered (incremental cost effectiveness ratio less than pound1000 (euro1175, $1650)). This finding was robust across a wide range of effectiveness estimates if the cheapest proton pump inhibitor was used. In our base case analysis, adding a proton pump inhibitor to a COX 2 selective inhibitor (used at the lowest licensed dose) was a cost effective option, even for patients at low risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (incremental cost effectiveness ratio approximately pound10 000). Uncertainties around relative adverse event rates meant relative cost effectiveness for individual COX 2 selective inhibitors and traditional NSAIDs was difficult to determine. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing a proton pump inhibitor for people with osteoarthritis who are taking a traditional NSAID or COX 2 selective inhibitor is cost effective. The cost effectiveness analysis was sensitive to adverse event data and the specific choice of COX 2 selective inhibitor or NSAID agent should, therefore, take into account individual cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Latimer, Nicholas","Lord, Joanne","Grant, Robert L","O\u0027Mahony, Rachel","Dickson, John","Conaghan, Philip G"],"dc:date":"2009-07-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":338381,"sim:weight":0.616118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":884762,"sim:weight":0.469404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.30016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23113,"sim:weight":0.29369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99453,"sim:weight":0.277002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.260185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998613,"sim:weight":0.257074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.246683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.239144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.235866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335728,"sim:weight":0.234545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.211562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.209476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.209476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999904,"sim:weight":0.187483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24852,"sim:weight":0.177473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040471,"sim:weight":0.175023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177157,"sim:weight":0.168541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177327,"sim:weight":0.163722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":191600,"sim:weight":0.116525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A questionnaire was sent to each of the units to collect data on patient numbers and dependency, staffing numbers and therapy, and nursing contact times on a single weekday. The response rate was 66% (92 sites) and information on 1,398 patients was provided. The median number of beds was 18 (interquartile range 12-24). Staffing levels per 10 beds were a median of 10.9 nurses, 1.7 physiotherapists, 1.3 occupational therapists and 0.4 speech and language therapists. Of the patients, 74% received physiotherapy, 46% occupational therapy and 25% speech and language therapy during the day with median contact times being 170 minutes for nursing, 40 minutes for physiotherapy, 45 minutes for occupational therapy and 30 minutes for speech therapy.

The aims of this study are to review research published in the past 15 years to provide insight into the factors impacting on the management of pain in children and identify strategies that can be used to improve pain management practices. Background. The evidence to guide nurses\u0027 pain management practices is readily available, in the form of clinical guidelines. However, children\u0027s nurses\u0027 pain management practices continue to fall short of the ideal with children experiencing moderate to severe unrelieved pain. Several factors have been suggested as providing an explanation for this. There is a need to explore the impact each of these factors have on pain management practices further. With this in mind, a literature review was undertaken. Design. Literature review. Methods. A computerised literature search was carried out using CINAHL, Medline and the British Nursing Index. The search terms used were as follows: pain, pain assessment, pain management, education, quality and nurses. Articles published in the last 15 years were included in the review. Results. Several themes emerged from this review of the literature as possible explanations for why children\u0027s pain is still not managed effectively. These include knowledge deficits; incorrect or outdated beliefs about pain and pain management; the decision-making strategies used and organisational culture. Conclusions. Improving pain management requires a multifactorial approach encompassing: education, institutional support, attitude shifts and change leaders. Issues that need addressing include education, decision-making strategies and organisational practices. Further research needs to be carried out to determine other factors that impact on pain management practices. Relevance to clinical practice. Despite the evidence to guide practice being readily available children continue to experience unrelieved pain. The strategies identified in this article may help to ensure that pain is relieved effectively.","bibo:AuthorList":["Twycross, Alison"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91117,"sim:weight":0.662757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46504,"sim:weight":0.271997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269880,"sim:weight":0.210589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.208484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99186,"sim:weight":0.20615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.201458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98462,"sim:weight":0.187069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.184246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48298,"sim:weight":0.179532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.17259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385794,"sim:weight":0.155406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.155057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.139356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.13758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In 2001 The National Health Service in the UK introduced a mandatory bacteraemia surveillance scheme for the reporting of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). This surveillance initiative reports on the percentage of isolates that are methicillin resistant. However, resistance to other antibiotics is not currently reported and therefore the scale of emerging resistance is currently unclear in the UK. In this study, multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) profiles against fourteen antimicrobial drugs were investigated for 705 isolates of S. aureus collected from two European study sites in the UK (London) and Malta. RESULTS: All isolates were susceptible to linezolid, teicoplanin and vancomycin. Multiple antibiotic resistance profiles from both countries were determined, a total of forty-two and forty-five profiles were seen in the UK cohort (MRSA and MSSA respectively) and comparatively, sixty-two and fifty-two profiles were shown in the Maltese group.

These are Anima Machina, Bosonica, Cipher, Papyrus, Pavakoothu, Spindlesong, Topographia and The Spindlesongs Installation. The works exhibit a variety of spatial characteristics, not only through the spatial implications of the sound material used, but also in their presentation formats. The portfolio comprises four stereo works, one 5.1 work, two 8-channel works and a work for solo instrument (clarinet) and electronics. All but one of the compositions are acousmatic, and the mixed work is greatly informed by the acousmatic tradition.\r\n\r\nThe main concern spanning the portfolio is the creation of spatial aspects on a number of levels, from source material through processing, layering and spatialisation to dissemination in performance. The commentary presents supplementary information on each work, with a view to providing the reader with an insight into the evolution of my compositional vocabulary. Those aspects considered spatially most significant are highlighted, with reference to the current musicological terminology of space-form (Smalley 2007) and other contextual writings in the field. The research findings are assembled according to the nature of spatial presentation: stereo, multichannel, installation, and instrumental performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Salazar, Diana"],"dc:date":"2010-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145970,"sim:weight":0.659299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931409,"sim:weight":0.635096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631440,"sim:weight":0.571201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52925,"sim:weight":0.559988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59502,"sim:weight":0.55554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69114,"sim:weight":0.535403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9858,"sim:weight":0.515151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43401,"sim:weight":0.445349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76619,"sim:weight":0.416897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91527,"sim:weight":0.393533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.384084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44390,"sim:weight":0.381765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.380869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103835,"sim:weight":0.375181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44852,"sim:weight":0.328269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.327253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99032,"sim:weight":0.327014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59644,"sim:weight":0.273841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46714,"sim:weight":0.272796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69113,"sim:weight":0.256021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The feedback rule allows for reactions to inflation and output gaps, and to developments in a trade-weighted exchange rate gap measure. The investigation finds that monetary policy in China has, on average, accommodated inflationary developments. But exchange rate shocks do not significantly affect monetary policy behavior, and there is no evidence of a structural break in the estimated reaction function at the end of the strict dollar peg in July 2005. The paper also runs an exercise incorporating survey-based inflation expectations into the policy reaction function and meets with some success.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mehrotra, Aaron","Sanchez-Fung, Jose"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90632,"sim:weight":0.741975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44680,"sim:weight":0.635553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44993,"sim:weight":0.590563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44392,"sim:weight":0.455501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47178,"sim:weight":0.431233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383391,"sim:weight":0.428361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269882,"sim:weight":0.425557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929233,"sim:weight":0.402272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336132,"sim:weight":0.39128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99494,"sim:weight":0.383002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48313,"sim:weight":0.348475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929231,"sim:weight":0.313176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44471,"sim:weight":0.304475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91276,"sim:weight":0.278683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337323,"sim:weight":0.248972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.239824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1057383,"sim:weight":0.237016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.227514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.116629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The dance of the puppets themselves is characterised by percussive sounds, and increased gestural energy towards the middle of the work At this point much of the sonic activity stems from the clarinet itself through live processing. Ultimately, all of the sound material stems from the clarinet, although this is not always apparent. The piece is characterised by the changing status of the puppeteer, the puppets, and the sonic landscape in which they exist.

Nevertheless, telemedical services involving multimedia data are still lagging behind, due to the concern of the end users, that is, clinicians and also patients, about the low quality provided. Indeed, emerging network technologies should be appropriately exploited by designing the transmission strategy focusing on quality provision for end users. Stemming from this principle, we propose here a context-aware transmission strategy for medical video transmission over WiMAX systems. Context, in terms of regions of interest (ROI) in a specific session, is taken into account for the identification of multiple regions of interest, and compression/transmission strategies are tailored to such context information. We present a methodology based on H.264 medical video compression and Flexible Macroblock Ordering (FMO) for ROI identification. Two different unequal error protection methodologies, providing higher protection to the most diagnostically relevant data, are presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martini, Maria G.","Hewage, Chaminda T.E.R."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":102577,"sim:weight":0.544096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":120725,"sim:weight":0.540339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998219,"sim:weight":0.535199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998077,"sim:weight":0.517692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998359,"sim:weight":0.505972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930990,"sim:weight":0.502544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999730,"sim:weight":0.461158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.432567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.417631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77103,"sim:weight":0.397268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.386257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336215,"sim:weight":0.375153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999728,"sim:weight":0.360848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929261,"sim:weight":0.357629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934810,"sim:weight":0.35753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102814,"sim:weight":0.351898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":793159,"sim:weight":0.339845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336058,"sim:weight":0.337916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930535,"sim:weight":0.335861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336220,"sim:weight":0.328553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We targeted three grammatical structures often reported as compromised in children with language impairments (copula, articles and auxiliaries). 26 children (8 girls) with language delay were recruited (mean age 4;10, range 3;8ï¿½6;0). These children met the standard criteria for\r\nSpecific Language Impairment and underwent an intervention focusing on the three targets. The intervention supplied negative evidence for target omissions, according to the precepts of the Direct Contrast hypothesis (Saxton, 1997). Each child received 20-minute therapeutic sessions daily over a six week period. Children with language delay were tested at four points: pre-intervention, mid-intervention, immediately postintervention and again six months later. To provide a basis for comparison, we also recruited a group of 116 typically developing children (62 girls) (mean age 5;9, range\r\n3;1-7;9). The grammaticality judgement task yielded two measures: (1) judgement of correctness; and (2) reaction time. Although clear differences were found between typical and atypical children, it was clear that even among the oldest typical children, none performed at ceiling. We also found significant improvements in the performance of language delayed children after the intervention.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saxton, Matthew","Dockrell, Julie","Bevan, Eleri","Van Herwegen, Jo"],"dc:date":"2007-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83718,"sim:weight":0.500546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82340,"sim:weight":0.470734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82396,"sim:weight":0.405433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99261,"sim:weight":0.355486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83022,"sim:weight":0.341494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383611,"sim:weight":0.329955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83030,"sim:weight":0.320639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83033,"sim:weight":0.31753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83024,"sim:weight":0.302186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.271339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46759,"sim:weight":0.266131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99051,"sim:weight":0.257826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99450,"sim:weight":0.247245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83016,"sim:weight":0.232641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45432,"sim:weight":0.222012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.196989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387078,"sim:weight":0.19092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.187923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387055,"sim:weight":0.148218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45228,"sim:weight":0.112828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this 30-month period, the DID recorded 198,023 inquiries, of which 118,724 were UK Licensed Pharmaceutical products with a further 79,299 inquiries made for substance not found in the database.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, dominated by Viagra(R), ranked 16th among the substance groups. The proportion of the inquiries made regarding PDE-5 inhibitors, especially in comparison to antibiotics, painkillers or alcohol, appears to be above the level that would normally be expected from medical need. No significant change in the months leading up to the Beijing Olympics was observed. On the contrary, the Nitric/Nitrate group showed a notable increase between 2006-2007 and 2008, suggesting a potential increase in interest in using nitric oxide among athletes.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: With patents recently filed for the use of agents containing sodium nitrite/nitrate to enhance blood flow for performance enhancement in sport, coupled with anecdotal evidence from internet athlete forums and media, there is a concern that athletes may endanger their health by using vasodilators to enhance athletic performance. PDE-5 inhibitors or chemicals in the nitrate/nitrate group are currently not prohibited or tested for by the doping control agencies but some are highly dangerous to health and can lead to cardiovascular collapse, coma and death. Its promotion among athletes as a performance enhancing supplement is ethically and medically questionable.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petroczi, Andrea","Naughton, Declan P"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90246,"sim:weight":0.452742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.335238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.297081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.295315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.294706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.274067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.274067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.273142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.273142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.261239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.2584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.252667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.252164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.251283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.24882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.24644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.22151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.218325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.214468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.18766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Cervical headaches and conditions involving the shoulder, such as subacromial pain syndrome, have all been associated with an increase in the thoracic kyphosis. Concomitantly a decrease in the thoracic kyphosis as a result of a stretching and strengthening rehabilitation programme is believed to be associated with a reduction in symptoms and pain and improvement in function. Clinicians generally measure the sagittal plane kyphosis angle visually. There is no certainty that this method is reliable or is capable of measuring angular changes over time or in response to intervention. As such a simple and reliable clinical method of measuring the thoracic kyphosis would enable clinicians to record this information. The aim of this investigation was to determine the intra-tester reliability of measuring the thoracic kyphosis angle using a clinical method\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Measurements were made in 45 subjects with and 45 subjects without upper body symptoms. Measurements were made with the subjects in relaxed standing. Two gravity dependent inclinometers were used to measure the kyphosis. The first was placed over the region of the 1st and 2nd thoracic spinous processes. The other, over the region of the 12th thoracic and 1st lumbar spinous processes. The angle produced by each inclinometer was measured 3 times in succession. Each set of 3 measurements was made on two occasions (separated by a minimum of 30 minutes and additional data collection involving 46 further measurements of posture and movement on the same and an additional subject before the thoracic kyphosis measurements were re-measured) by one rater. The reliability of the measurements was analyzed using 2-way ANOVA intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and standard error of measurement (SEM) for precision, for a single measurement [ICC(single)] and the average of 3 measures [ICC(average)]. The assessor remained \u0027blinded\u0027 to data input and the measurements were staggered to reduce examiner bias.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: The measurement of the thoracic kyphosis as used in this investigation was found to have excellent intra-rater reliability for both subjects with and without symptoms. The ICC(single) results for the subjects without symptoms were, .95; (95% CI .91-.97). The corresponding ICC(average) results were; .97; (95% CI .95-.99). The results for the subjects with symptoms were; 93; (95% CI .88-.96), for ICC(single) and for ICC(average); .97; (95% CI .94-.98). The SEM results for subjects without and with symptoms were 1.0 degrees and 1.7 degrees , respectively.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this immediate test-retest reliability study suggest that the clinical measurement of the thoracic kyphosis using gravity dependent inclinometers demonstrates excellent intra-rater reliability. Additional research is required to determine the inter-rater reliability of this method.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lewis, Jeremy S","Valentine, Rachel E"],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91257,"sim:weight":0.280558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26590,"sim:weight":0.259656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99126,"sim:weight":0.255337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.254159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75288,"sim:weight":0.253372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109023,"sim:weight":0.211547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56591,"sim:weight":0.208513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.205814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.203313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.199223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.192131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.189902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.187806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.183661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":35502,"sim:weight":0.180982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.176932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.174731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.169384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.169197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17895,"sim:weight":0.168413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The relative contribution of individual prognostic indicators to the pattern of recovery remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic value of demographic, psychosocial, employment and clinical factors on outcome in patients with low back pain\r\n\r\nMETHODS: A prospective cohort study with six-month follow-up was undertaken at a multidisciplinary back pain clinic in central London employing physiotherapists, osteopaths, clinical psychologists and physicians, receiving referrals from 123 general practitioners. Over a twelve-month period, 593 consecutive patients referred from general practice with simple low back pain were recruited. A baseline questionnaire was developed to elicit information on potential prognostic variables. The primary outcome measures were change in 24-item Roland Morris disability questionnaire score at six months as a measure of low back related functional disability and the physical functioning scale of the SF-36, adjusted for baseline scores.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Roland Morris scores improved by 3.8 index points (95% confidence interval 3.23 to 4.32) at six months and SF-36 physical functioning score by 10.7 points (95% confidence interval 8.36 to 12.95). Ten factors were linked to outcome yet in a multiple regression model only two remained predictive. Those with episodic rather than continuous pain were more likely to have recovered at six months (odds ratio 2.64 confidence interval 1.25 to 5.60), while those that classified themselves as non-white were less likely to have recovered (0.41 confidence interval 0.18 to 0.96).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Analysis controlling for confounding variables, demonstrated that participants showed greater improvement if their episodes of pain during the previous year were short-lived while those with Middle Eastern, North African and Chinese ethnicity demonstrated minimal improvement.

Information was initially collected by home interview and a follow-up postal questionnaire 12-18 months later. The age that respondents felt was a more sensitive indicator than chronological age of many indicators of the respondents\u0027 health, psychological and social characteristics. Multiple regression analysis showed that baseline health and functional status, and reported changes in these at follow-up, explained 20.4 per cent of the variance in self-perceived age. Adding baseline mental health (anxiety/depression), feelings and fears about ageing at follow-up explained a further 0.8 per cent of the variance, making the total variance explained 21.2 per cent.

Baseline findings from a British survey of aging","bibo:abstract":"Objectives: To investigate the relation between perceived neighbourhood environment, social contact and support, and self efficacy, on the health of older people.\r\nDesign: British cross sectional population survey of people aged 65 and over. \r\n\r\nParticipants: 999 people aged 65 plus living at home in Britain. \r\n\r\nResults: Regression modelling showed that high self efficacy had a strong independent association with better self rated health status and physical functioning. Indicators of perceived neighbourhood environment that showed strong associations with both good health and functioning were: perceptions of good quality facilities in the area (social/leisure, facilities for people aged 65+, rubbish collection, health services, transport, closeness to shops, somewhere nice to walk), and high levels of neighbourliness (knows/trusts people). Perceptions of problems in the area (noise, crime, air quality, rubbish/litter, traffic, graffiti) were also predictive of poorer health. Measures of social contact and support did not show any independent associations with health or functioning. \r\n\r\nConclusions: The unique value of this paper is in the simultaneous analysis of associations between perceived neighbourhood, social contact and support, self efficacy, and health. The consistent strength of older people?s perceptions of the quality of facilities in their neighbourhoods shows that responsive reinforcement of local infrastructures might have wider health benefits. Also of interest was the strength of self efficacy as a predictor of self rated health and physical functioning.

This effect was evident on several decisions: elderly patients were less likely to be prescribed a statin given a cholesterol test, referred to a cardiologist, given an exercise tolerance test, angiography and revascularisation; more likely to have their current prescriptions changed and to be given a follow-up appointment. There was no effect of specialty, gender or years of training on influence of patient age. Those doctors who were influenced by age were on average five years older than those who were not. Interviews revealed that some doctors saw old age as a contraindication to treat. \r\n\r\nConclusions: Age, independent of comorbidity, presentation and patients? wishes, directly influenced decision-making about angina investigation and treatment by half of the doctors in the primary and secondary care samples.

Respondents in both samples with better, compared with worse, quality of life had significantly reduced odds of having extreme fears of dying (ethnically diverse sample, OR 0.924 (95% CI 0.898 to 0.951); British population sample, OR 0.981 (95% CI 0.966 to 0.996); both p\u0026lt;0.001).

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with people with chronic knee pain, before (n\u003d29) and after (n\u003d23) participation on the programme. Thematic analysis was used to document people\u0027s baseline health beliefs, attitudes and cognitions, and to see if how and why these changed after completing the programme. RESULTS: Initially people had poor understanding and negative, fatalistic beliefs about the management or prognosis for knee pain. Following the programme the majority of participants had positive experiences describing improvement in pain, physical and psychosocial functioning, greater knowledge and understanding of their condition and treatment options, and in their ability to use exercise to control symptoms. Beliefs about the causation and prognosis of knee pain were unchanged, but their concerns about possible dangers of exercise had decreased, they appreciated how exercise could reduce symptoms (treatment beliefs) and their confidence in their ability to use exercise to effect improvements (exercise self-efficacy) increased. These improvements were attributed to the content and structure of the programme, and the care and guidance of the physiotherapist. Several expressed a need for on-going support.

In this study the management received by people with chronic knee pain, their management preferences and reasons for these preferences were recorded. METHODS: At baseline assessment of a clinical trial of rehabilitation for chronic knee pain, 415 participants were asked about their i) previous management, ii) preferred treatment, if any, iii) whether they would undergo knee surgery and iv) reasons for their preferences. RESULTS: Previous management--Medication was the most common treatment, followed by physiotherapy, 39 participants had received no treatment. Preferences--166 patients expressed no treatment preference. Of those who expressed a preference the most popular option was physiotherapy, whilst not having surgery was the third most frequent response. The most common reason for preferring physiotherapy and not wanting surgery was prior experience.Willingness to accept surgery--390 participants were not waiting for knee replacement surgery, and overall 81% would not accept surgery if offered, usually because pain was not perceived to be severe enough to warrant surgery. CONCLUSION: Most chronic knee pain is managed with medication despite concerns about safety, efficacy and cost, management guidelines recommendations and people\u0027s management preferences. Previous experience and perceptions of need were major determinants of people\u0027s preferences, but many people were unaware of management options. Appreciating patient preferences and provision of more information about management options are important in facilitating informed patient/clinician discussion and agreement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mitchell, Helene L.","Hurley, Michael V."],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99453,"sim:weight":0.534411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.531592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24815,"sim:weight":0.428988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177092,"sim:weight":0.387549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.386088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448025,"sim:weight":0.344524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.343158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.329218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.322307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.316381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8337,"sim:weight":0.311172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780059,"sim:weight":0.305316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.295038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631760,"sim:weight":0.285525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177102,"sim:weight":0.265401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99012,"sim:weight":0.264722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.262156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.259551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.259551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335728,"sim:weight":0.254494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A national survey of adults in Britain","bibo:abstract":"Aim To document population perceptions of well-being and predictors of self-assessed well-being.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: National face-to-face interview survey of adults aged ?16 years, conducted by the Office for National Statistics for their Omnibus Survey in Britain (response 58%; 1049 of 1823 eligible).\r\n\r\nRESULTS: People aged 65+ years were more likely than younger people to define well-being as being able to continue to do the things they had always done. Most men and women, in all age groups, rated their well-being and mental well-being positively. Self-rated health, mental health symptoms, long-standing illness and social support were the main drivers of overall well-being in all age groups. Mental health symptoms, long-standing illness and social support were the main drivers of mental well-being. For example, in reduced multivariable models, those who reported no long-standing illness had almost twice the odds of others, of good, rather than not good, overall well-being, and over three times the odds of good, rather than not good, mental well-being. The odds of good versus not good overall well-being were also multiplied by 1.002 for each additional available person for comfort and support and similarly by 1.073 in relation to mental well-being.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Understanding the drivers of well-being among adults, including older adults, is of high policy importance. Attention should be focused on improvements in population health and functioning and on encouraging younger and older people to develop and maintain social support networks and engagement in social activities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bowling, Ann"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91593,"sim:weight":0.507349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496274,"sim:weight":0.40306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.366101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914778,"sim:weight":0.343858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.342289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.332355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.303255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.302442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.29715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.290602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50132,"sim:weight":0.261064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.241178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.211022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this study was to investigate dimensions and correlates of QOL associated with frailty status among community-dwelling older outpatients.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 239 community-dwelling outpatients aged 65+ (mean age 81.5 years) consecutively referred to a geriatric medicine clinic in Italy between June and November 2009. Participants underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment, including assessment of their frailty status according to the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) criteria, and QOL, which was evaluated by using the Older People\u0027s QOL (OPQOL) questionnaire. One-way ANOVA and chi-squared tests were used to find correlates of frailty, including QOL dimensions, after stratification of participants in the \"robust\" (n \u003d 72), \"pre-frail\" (n \u003d 89) and \"frail\" (n \u003d 78) groups. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to find correlates of QOL in the overall sample and among \"frail\" and \"robust\" participants.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: A negative trend of QOL with frailty status was found for almost all dimensions of QOL (health, independence, home and neighbourhood, psychological and emotional well-being, and leisure, activities and religion) except for social relationships and participation and financial circumstances. Independent correlates of a poor QOL in the total sample were \"reduced energy level\" (SOF criterion for frailty), depressive status, dependence in transferring and bathing abilities and money management (adjusted R squared 0.39); among \"frail\" participants the associations were with depressive status and younger age, and among \"robust\" participants the association was with lower body mass index.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Five out of seven dimensions of QOL were negatively affected by frailty, but only one SOF criterion for frailty was independently related to QOL, after correction for age, functional status and depression. A more advanced age as well as a better affective status were correlates of a better QOL among frail elders. Interventions targeting the QOL in frail community-dwelling older outpatients should consider as outcomes, not only health-related QOL, but also other domains of the QOL.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bilotta, Claudio","Bowling, Ann","Case, Alessandra","Nicolini, Paola","Mauri, Sabrina","Castelli, Manuela","Vergani, Carlo"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9045340,"sim:weight":0.33346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99012,"sim:weight":0.281328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914778,"sim:weight":0.280579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.262387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.254866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.254243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.25188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.231433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.22568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387164,"sim:weight":0.223714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.221863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.194426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.194426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.192249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.189128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.188058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.171521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.156933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article reports on research into the use of nurse documentation on a stoma care ward in a large London hospital, and explores the factors that may affect the process of record keeping by nursing staff. This study uses stoma care as a case study to explore the role of documentation on the ward, focusing on how this can be improved. It is based on quantitative and qualitative methods. The medical notes of 56 patients were analysed and in addition, focus groups with a number of nurses were undertaken. Quantitative findings indicate that although 80% of patients had a chart filed in their medical notes, only a small portion of the form was completed by nursing staff. Focus group findings indicate that this is because forms lacked standardization and because the language used was often ambiguous.

A comparison of the OPQOL, CASP-19 and WHOQOL-OLD","bibo:abstract":"Background Most measures of quality of life (QoL) are based on \u0027expert\u0027 opinions. This study describes a new measure of QoL in older age, the Older People\u0027s QoL Questionnaire (OPQOL), which is unique in being derived from the views of lay people, cross-checked against theoretical models for assessment of comprehensiveness. Its performance was assessed cross-sectionally and longitudinally. It was compared with two existing QoL measures in the cross-sectional studies in order to identify the optimal measure for use with older populations. Methods Data were taken from three surveys of older people living at home in Britain in 2007-2008: one population survey of people aged 65+, one focused enumeration survey of ethnically diverse older people aged 65+, one follow-up of a population survey of people aged 65+ at baseline in 1999/2000. Measures were QoL (using OPQOL, Control, Autonomy, Satisfaction, Pleasure - 19 items (CASP-19), World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire - version for older people (WHOQOL-OLD)), health, social and socioeconomic circumstances. The CASP-19 and WHOQOL-OLD were not administered to the longitudinal sample in order to reduce respondent burden. Results Psychometric tests were applied to each QoL measure. The OPQOL, CASP-19 and WHOQOL-OLD performed well with the cross-sectional samples; however, only the OPQOL met criteria for internal consistency in the Ethnibus samples. Conclusion The OPQOL is of potential value in the outcome assessment of health and social interventions, which can have a multidimensional impact on people\u0027s lives. Further research is needed to examine whether differences by ethnicity reflect real differences in QoL, methodological issues, variations in expectations or cultural differences in reporting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bowling, Ann","Stenner, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91560,"sim:weight":0.843022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91562,"sim:weight":0.626492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.236496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.226207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.219228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.218658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.200685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.170227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.157794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17910,"sim:weight":0.141812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":192939,"sim:weight":0.0504825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The experimental model was called ASSET (Age/Sex Standardised Estimates of Treatment). METHODS AND MAJOR FINDINGS: Individual prescription costs and demographic data referred to 3,175,691 Italian subjects and were collected directly from three Regional Health Authorities over the 12-month period between October 2004 and September 2005. The mean annual prescription cost per individual was similar for males (196.13 euro) and females (195.12 euro). After 65 years of age, the mean prescribing costs for males were significantly higher than females. On average, costs for a 75-year-old subject would be 12 times the costs for a 25-34 year-old subject if male, 8 times if female. Subjects over 65 years of age (22% of total population) accounted for 56% of total prescribing costs. The weightings explained approximately 90% of the evolution of total prescribing costs, in spite of the pricing and reimbursement turbulences affecting Italy in the 2000-2005 period. The ASSET weightings were able to explain only about 25% of the variation in prescribing costs among individuals. CONCLUSIONS: If mainly idiosyncratic prescribing by general practitioners causes the unexplained variations, the introduction of capitation-based budgets would gradually move practices with high prescribing costs towards the national average. It is also possible, though, that the unexplained individual variation in prescribing costs is the result of differences in the clinical characteristics or socio-economic conditions of practice populations. If this is the case, capitation-based budgets may lead to unfair distribution of resources. The ASSET age/sex weightings should be used as a guide, not as the ultimate determinant, for an equitable allocation of prescribing resources to regional authorities and general practices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Favato, Giampiero","Mariani, Paolo","Mills, Roger W.","Capone, Alessandro","Pelagatti, Matteo","Pieri, Vasco","Marcobelli, Alberico","Trotta, Maria G.","Zucchi, Alberto","Catapano, Alberico L."],"dc:date":"2007-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":113157,"sim:weight":0.365625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.302971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.295691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.29363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.248532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177170,"sim:weight":0.244754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.236173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.231001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.230043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.228192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29886,"sim:weight":0.223093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.213172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.207578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387142,"sim:weight":0.199304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.144448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The survey results were supported by a series of interviews exploring the issues in relationship management which are also summarised in this report. Clients, Suppliers and Independent Consultants were included from both public and private sector organisations with over 100 managers taking part in the survey. \r\nThe results demonstrate the complexity of evaluating a concept such as culture for all concerned, although a significant number of respondents do try to assess culture when negotiating contracts. In this study clients voted ï¿½serviceï¿½ as the most important element of culture and this was reinforced by the interviews where slow decision making, misunderstandings and aggressive behaviours were cited as evidence of poor service orientation linked to cultural differences.\r\nCulture was assessed in the survey by comparison of self and\r\npartner across nine dimensions, including service, attention to\r\ndetail, innovation and focus on end results. Clients and suppliers tended to rate themselves higher than their partners on most of the elements assessed, in particular innovation. Suppliers rated clients as more aggressive, a statistic supported by the qualitative interview findings where ï¿½bullyingï¿½ was a clear issue. There were differences in all responses between those who classed their outsourcing as a success and those who did not, but in particular communications and relationships were viewed as more problematic, and they were less likely to report that their partner had prepared staff for cultural differences.\r\nOver 75% of respondents stated that they would take more\r\naccount of culture next time, rising to over 80% for those involved in offshoring, indicating the importance of national as well as organisational differences. However it is also clear that some differences in culture are beneficial, and that it is critical to assess which cultural elements are important in what circumstances. An important outcome from best practice advice is that organisations need to assess their own culture and requirements as well as that of their partner, looking for potential matches or clashes.\r\nHolding cultural workshops, having metrics for communication\r\nand clear service expectations were also high on the list of ï¿½must doï¿½ priorities. The overall conclusion is that a crucial aspect of successful outsourcing - service orientation - is impacted by perceptions of staff attitudes and behaviours, and that further work on development of a service quality measurement is needed.\r\nThis report also includes a range of excellent best practice advice from leading experts and practitioners in the field.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morgan, Stephanie J."],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.441012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.424677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75399,"sim:weight":0.404464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.401303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.388222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.374912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.359226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.349992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.348749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75350,"sim:weight":0.347323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77189,"sim:weight":0.345697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.344847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.332844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46163,"sim:weight":0.323844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.311285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.305504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48424,"sim:weight":0.303102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338123,"sim:weight":0.291603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.167188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The objective of this paper is to examine the implementation of environmental, social practices of property investors in Malaysia as revealed through published company material.\r\nContent analysis is used in this research. Analysis was conducted of potential SRPI (Socially Responsible Property Investment) or ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) initiatives of all (13) Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), together with a selection of property investment companies and key institutional investors using publicly available company literature. The websites and annual reports of these investors from 2007-2009 were examined in order to identify activities, strategies contributing to the progress of sustainable and responsible property investment. The progress made was also compared with progresses made in other countries including UK, USA and Australia.\r\nThe study indicates that although some of the Malaysian REITs and property investment companies are beginning to adopt sustainability practices this is less embedded than in other major countries notably Australia. The study also shows that the sustainability agenda is skewed more to notion of corporate philanthropy than environmental issues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohd Aini, Ainoriza","Sayce, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.452456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.412567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108312,"sim:weight":0.393785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85702,"sim:weight":0.377672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.358172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.326168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.322512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.312492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.311215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.307286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.303801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.295557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86062,"sim:weight":0.261943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.256587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.256587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.250289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.232063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77201,"sim:weight":0.226874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.175388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.16766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Adding years to life and life to years may require two distinct and different approaches, one physical and the other psychological.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how athletes presenting with these symptoms are diagnosed and managed in primary care.\r\nMETHODS:\r\n\r\nAn electronic survey was distributed to a random selection of family practitioners in England. The survey was designed to assess the frequency with which family practitioners encounter adults with exercise-related respiratory symptoms and how they would approach diagnostic work-up and management. The survey also evaluated awareness of and access to diagnostic tests in this setting and general knowledge of prescribing asthma treatments to competitive athletes.\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\n257 family practitioners completed the online survey. One-third of respondents indicated they encountered individuals with this problem at a frequency of more than one case per month. Over two-thirds of family practitioners chose investigation as an initial management strategy, while one-quarter would initiate treatment based on clinical information alone. PEFR pre- and post-exercise was the most commonly selected test for investigation (44%), followed by resting spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilator (35%). Short-acting beta2-agonists were the most frequently selected choice of treatment indicated by respondents (90%).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nFamily practitioners encounter individuals with exercise-related respiratory symptoms commonly and although objective testing is often employed in diagnostic work-up, the tests most frequently utilised are not the most accurate for diagnosis of EIB. This diagnostic approach may be dictated by the reported lack of access to more precise testing methods, or may reflect a lack of dissemination or awareness of current evidence. Overall the findings have implications both for the management and hence welfare of athletes presenting with this problem to family practitioners and also for the competitive athletes requiring therapeutic use exemption.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hull, James H","Hull, Peter J","Parsons, Jonathan P","Dickinson, John W","Ansley, Les"],"dc:date":"2009-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.313931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.298682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337258,"sim:weight":0.287347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337284,"sim:weight":0.280976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98656,"sim:weight":0.277663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.276528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.271327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.26231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.248977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.241109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.223818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.219384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.216724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.214385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.212571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.210743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22742,"sim:weight":0.192904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337251,"sim:weight":0.170709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337307,"sim:weight":0.164982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":192098,"sim:weight":0.122576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Initially this involved material that was fully chromatic and progressed through all twelve pitches in the manner of a series. More recently and in this work in particular, I have sought to vary this process and make it more flexible allowing a range of different harmonic densities to be explored while retaining the link between small scale material and large scale structure. In this work I also sought to expand this concept into the field of rhythm and to draw links between the rhythmic proportions of motifs and phrases and between the proportions of sections of the work as a whole, and idea first explored in \u0027Lines of  Communication\u0027 (1987) and followed up in \u0027Altiplano\u0027 (1990) and subsequent works.\r\n\r\nAn early compositional decision was to create material that exploited the raucous and inflexible tone of the low register of the instrument rather than shying away from it. This dictated the general character of the music while setting up the opportunity to exploit some quieter and subtler regions of the instrument in order to create contrast. In particular a technique of alternating conventional and harmonic fingerings to create a continuous stream of notes was explored, at the outset, to generate energy and, in the latter parts of the piece, at a slower tempo, to exploit the timbral variation between the different versions of the same note.\r\n\r\nThe piano writing reflects and supports the varying nature of the saxophone material, adds resonance to the textures and, most importantly, provokes the saxophone into action, demanding a variety of responses from it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ewers, Tim"],"dc:date":"2003-03-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":55913,"sim:weight":0.414485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654894,"sim:weight":0.398615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108179,"sim:weight":0.389426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52216,"sim:weight":0.351239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52925,"sim:weight":0.350757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57372,"sim:weight":0.350668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.331504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67870,"sim:weight":0.330901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67872,"sim:weight":0.327065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67873,"sim:weight":0.327065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67875,"sim:weight":0.323579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1548636,"sim:weight":0.323579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58923,"sim:weight":0.312699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53558,"sim:weight":0.311304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.308798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108628,"sim:weight":0.305581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.302053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108430,"sim:weight":0.286231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108619,"sim:weight":0.284733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108303,"sim:weight":0.278003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I was introduced to the xiao when fulfilling a commission to write for an ensemble of Chinese instruments (Seeking Illustrious Virtue, 2000). In writing this piece, I constructed pitch sets and modes that imitate the proportions of the natural overtone series and use them both harmonically and melodically throughout. For much of the piece, a fundamental pitch is sustained as a drone allowing the pianist to undertake some exploration of natural harmonics of the same pitch (playing inside the piano). Through pitch bending and use of some quarter tone fingerings, the flute is also able to explore timbral variation between harmonic and natural fingerings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ewers, Tim"],"dc:date":"2004-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52216,"sim:weight":0.356739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85804,"sim:weight":0.285148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53558,"sim:weight":0.265185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108179,"sim:weight":0.256452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55913,"sim:weight":0.255044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57372,"sim:weight":0.249302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108216,"sim:weight":0.224561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52925,"sim:weight":0.222204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67875,"sim:weight":0.205426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1548636,"sim:weight":0.205426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108628,"sim:weight":0.20482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67870,"sim:weight":0.202668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67872,"sim:weight":0.200319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67873,"sim:weight":0.200319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.197123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59574,"sim:weight":0.196219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58823,"sim:weight":0.188447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58923,"sim:weight":0.187687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108430,"sim:weight":0.186808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1548635,"sim:weight":0.18227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The headteachers shared many of the marketing problems of owner-managers of small firms.  Headteachers found that the most effective marketing strategies consisted of: i) marketing to improve relationships with existing parents, staff and governors as an essential precursor to any external marketing effort;  ii) parental involvement in the school which improved the likelihood of word of mouth recommendations; and iii) influencing such recommendations by marketing to improve parental and other involvement in the school.

The texts also operate on a number of different levels: the literal meaning; a sub-level of literal meaning created by the typographic breaking of words into parts, some of which have independent meaning and the level of the sounds of the words themselves. There is also a level of imagined meaning created by the use of symbols such as the final line of D-re-A-mi-N-gl-Y which consists entirely of punctuation marks. I have created a number of musical layers which reflect the text and also continue a compositional interest first established in ‘Strata’ (1979) and continued in ‘Escalation(1984)’, ‘Altiplano’ (1990) and ‘Blackheath Counterpoint’ (1992, Forward Music). The layers in this piece are: singing voice; sprechstimme voice; ostinatos; symmetrical chord progressions; and resonance. They have varying degrees of independence and are not continuous, overlapping in varying combinations throughout.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ewers, Tim"],"dc:date":"2005-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.25895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.240402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108179,"sim:weight":0.237603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.227051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55913,"sim:weight":0.219089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108303,"sim:weight":0.20837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57372,"sim:weight":0.207643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108280,"sim:weight":0.205662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108216,"sim:weight":0.200128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.199969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108430,"sim:weight":0.198581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447855,"sim:weight":0.198386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108628,"sim:weight":0.196475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52925,"sim:weight":0.19631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58923,"sim:weight":0.194468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108619,"sim:weight":0.186944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734362,"sim:weight":0.17718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Quartertones are primarily used to inflect melodic shapes and as intermediate points of progression between fixed harmonic landmarks. A further research aim was to explore spatial separation through the creation of a variety of ensembles and sub-groupings within the quartet. These small-scale hierarchical changes are reflected by movement of players during the performance and through spatial separation in the recording process. The use of spatial movement is something I first explored in ‘Four Quartets’ (1981) and ‘Spaces’ (1981). It is also intended that this movement of performers will increase the dramatic potential of the live presentation of the work. The proportions of the work overall are also reflected in the small-scale rhythmic proportions of motifs, a process employed in ‘Blast’ (2003) and earlier works (cited above).","bibo:AuthorList":["Ewers, Tim"],"dc:date":"2007-05-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67878,"sim:weight":0.265805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67870,"sim:weight":0.256932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67872,"sim:weight":0.253954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67873,"sim:weight":0.253954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108179,"sim:weight":0.231797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1548636,"sim:weight":0.22001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67875,"sim:weight":0.22001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108628,"sim:weight":0.210016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108430,"sim:weight":0.206801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55913,"sim:weight":0.206792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52925,"sim:weight":0.194755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52216,"sim:weight":0.190391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108619,"sim:weight":0.188864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53558,"sim:weight":0.187794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.18688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652816,"sim:weight":0.176592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58923,"sim:weight":0.175553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57372,"sim:weight":0.175504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108303,"sim:weight":0.171801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.169055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

AIMS: To determine whether the perceived effort of ventilation is altered through substituting a less dense gas for normal ambient air and whether this substitution affects performance of maximal incremental exercise in trained athletes. METHODS: Eight highly trained cyclists (mean SD) maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2)max) \u003d 69.9 (7.9) (mlO(2)/kg/min) performed two randomised maximal tests in a hyperbaric chamber breathing ambient air composed of either 35% O(2)/65% N(2) (nitrox) or 35% O(2)/65% He (heliox). A ramp protocol was used in which power output was incremented at 0.5 W/s. The trials were separated by at least 48 h. The perceived effort of breathing was obtained via Borg Category Ratio Scales at 3-min intervals and at fatigue. Oxygen consumption (VO(2)) and minute ventilation (V(E)) were monitored continuously. RESULTS: Breathing heliox did not change the sensation of dyspnoea: there were no differences between trials for the Borg scales at any time point. Exercise performance was not different between the nitrox and heliox trials (peak power output \u003d 451 (58) and 453 (56) W), nor was VO(2)max (4.96 (0.61) and 4.88 (0.65) l/min) or maximal V(E) (157 (24) and 163 (22) l/min). Between-trial variability in peak power output was less than either VO(2)max or maximal V(E). CONCLUSION: Breathing a less dense gas does not improve maximal performance of exercise or reduce the perception of breathing effort in highly trained athletes, although an attenuated submaximal tidal volume and V(E) with a concomitant reduction in VO(2) suggests an improved gas exchange and reduced O(2) cost of ventilation when breathing heliox.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ansley, L.","Petersen, D.","Thomas, A.","St Clair Gibson, A.","Robson-Ansley, P.","Noakes, T.D."],"dc:date":"2007-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90066,"sim:weight":0.231766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848229,"sim:weight":0.216176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.201042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.170321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.168855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1928656,"sim:weight":0.160304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.141128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.127228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25871,"sim:weight":0.0928783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Specifically, the paper considers how cultural entrepreneurs in the music industry market not to customers, but to networks that control the resources necessary to support entrepreneurial ventures. Evidence is drawn from the qualitative research of a study on access to finance by owner-managers of independent music companies (“cultural entrepreneurs”). The findings support the notion that “legitimation” is a key factor in accessing such resources. Cultural entrepreneurs have difficulties in establishing either “pragmatic legitimation” (derived from the self-interest of organisations across marketing networks) or “cognitive legitimation” (derived from perceptions of normality and conformity within marketing networks). Marketing strategies at both individual and industry level are put forward to overcome these barriers. For individual businesses, a “selection strategy” using creative clusters or a “manipulation strategy” that manages the cultural environment are recommended. The implications for relationship marketing models are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, Nicholas.C.","Stokes, David"],"dc:date":"2004-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.490125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930215,"sim:weight":0.467157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.425228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58828,"sim:weight":0.418504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.353828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.351817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.326371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.326371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76162,"sim:weight":0.323189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.319488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.315292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.302322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177298,"sim:weight":0.236564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.195399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337245,"sim:weight":0.132422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Survey data were analysed for association between supplements used and motives for using such substances among young athletes along with the sources of advice and literature precedents on supplement effects. METHODS: Participants were elite UK male and female athletes, within the age range between 12 and 21 (n \u003d 403), mean age 17.66 +/- 1.99. Associations between type of supplements and reasons for using supplements were tested by calculating Pearson\u0027s chi2 and the strength of these symmetric associations shown by phi association coefficients. RESULTS: Single supplement use was reported by 48.1%, with energy drinks being the most popular, consumed by 41.7% of all athletes and 86.6% of the supplement users in the sample. No agreement was observed between athletes\u0027 rationale and behaviour in relation to nutritional supplements except for creatine. Among health professionals, nutritionists and physiotherapists, followed by coaches, were most frequently consulted. Answers regarding reasons and supplements used showed incongruence and suggest widespread misinformation regarding supplements and their effects is an issue for the young athlete. CONCLUSION: Widespread supplement taking behaviour was evidenced in the young elite athlete population with the most notable congruence between rationale and practice among young athletes being performance-related. Young athletes in the present sample appear to be less \u0027health conscious\u0027 and more \u0027performance focused\u0027 than their adult counterparts.

Pomegranate formulations containing ferrous salts have enhanced although short-term, antibacteriophage activities which are rapidly diminished owing to instability of the ferrous combination. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activities of combinations of pomegranate rind extracts (PRE) with a range of metals salts with the added stabiliser vitamin C. METHODS: PRE solutions, prepared by blending rind sections with distilled water prior to sterilisation by autoclaving or filtration, were screened with a disc diffusion assay using penicillin G as a control. Suspension assays were used to determine the antimicrobial activities of PRE alone and in combination with salts of the following metals; Fe (II), Cu (II), Mn (II) or Zn (II), and vitamin C, against a panel of microbes following exposure for 30 mins. The test organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The screening assay demonstrated that PRE exhibited activity against the Gram positive organisms at 24 h with no observable effect on any of the Gram negative bacteria. However, after 12 h, zones of inhibition were only observed for Ps. aeruginosa. In contrast, using the suspension assay, addition of Cu (II) salts to PRE solutions extended the activities resulting in no detectable growth being observed for the PRE/Cu (II) combination against E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Minimal antimicrobial activity was observed following incubation with Fe (II), Mn (II) or Zn (II) salts alone or in combination with PRE against any of the organisms in the test panel. The addition of vitamin C markedly enhanced the activities of both PRE/Fe (II) and PRE/Cu (II) combinations against S. aureus. CONCLUSION: This is the first report demonstrating the enhanced efficacy of PRE/metal salt combinations in the presence of the stabilising agent vitamin C, to which all isolates were sensitive with the exception of B. subtilis. This study has validated the exploration of PRE along with additives such as metal salts and vitamin C as novel antimicrobial combinations.","bibo:AuthorList":["McCarrell, Erin M","Gould, Simon WJ","Fielder , Mark D","Kelly , Alison F","El Sankary, Waffa","Naughton, Declan P"],"dc:date":"2008-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91067,"sim:weight":0.559946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26680,"sim:weight":0.311388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2835560,"sim:weight":0.278765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18949,"sim:weight":0.278765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643700,"sim:weight":0.259031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930803,"sim:weight":0.257011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.241814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.241814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.232087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316476,"sim:weight":0.229256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.22074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.209653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631958,"sim:weight":0.200717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.19359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631579,"sim:weight":0.191162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222853,"sim:weight":0.184483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77276,"sim:weight":0.173326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The seasonal and demographic characteristics of SC during this time appear strikingly similar to those observed today, and witness the introduction of modern \"statistically averaging\" techniques in the approach to complex paediatric syndromes. Great Ormond Street (GOS) hospital case notes provide detailed descriptions of the \"typical cases\" of SC, and show that British physicians working in the early age of paediatric hospitals succeeded in recognising the most distinctive clinical features of this fascinating condition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martino, D.","Tanner, A.","Defazio, G.","Church, A.

Serotype III strains cause the majority of late-onset sepsis and meningitis in babies, and thus appear to have an enhanced invasive capacity compared with the other serotypes that cause disease predominantly in immunocompromised pregnant women. We compared the serotype III and V whole genome sequences, strains NEM316 and 2603VR respectively, in an attempt to identify genetic attributes of strain NEM316 that might explain the propensity of strain NEM316 to cause late-onset disease in babies. Fourteen putative pathogenicity islands were described in the strain NEM316 whole genome sequence. Using PCR- and targeted microarray- strategies, the presence of these islands were assessed in a diverse strain collection including 18 colonizing isolates from healthy pregnant women, and 13 and 8 invasive isolates from infants with early- and late-onset sepsis, respectively.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nSide-by-side comparison of the strain NEM316 and strain 2603VR genomes revealed that they are extremely similar, with the only major difference being the capsulation loci and mobile genetic elements. PCR and Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH) were used to define the presence of each island in 39 GBS isolates. Only islands I, VI, XII, and possibly X, met criteria of a true pathogenicity island, but no significant correlation was found between the presence of any of the fourteen islands and whether the strains were invasive or colonizing. Possible associations were seen between the presence of island VI and late-onset sepsis, and island X and early-onset sepsis, which warrant further investigation.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThe NEM316 and 2603VR strains are remarkable in that their whole genome sequences are so similar, suggesting that the capsulation loci or other genetic differences, such as pathogenicity islands, are the main determinants of the propensity of serotype III strains to cause late-onset disease. This study supports the notion that GBS strain NEM316 has four putative pathogenicity islands, but none is absolutely necessary for disease causation, whether early- or late-onset sepsis. Mobile genetic elements are a common feature of GBS isolates, with each strain having its own peculiar burden of transposons, phages, integrases and integrated plasmids. The majority of these are unlikely to influence the disease capacity of an isolate. Serotype associated disease phenotypes may thus be solely related to differences in the capsulation loci.","bibo:AuthorList":["Herbert, Mark A","Beveridge, Catriona J E","McCormick, David","Aten, Emmelien","Jones, Nicola","Snyder, Lori A S","Saunders, Nigel J"],"dc:date":"2005-05-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1577106,"sim:weight":0.290871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1438135,"sim:weight":0.277675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26480,"sim:weight":0.120504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although patterns can already be generated at the fold and topological levels, no system produces high-resolution 3D patterns including atom and cavity positions. To address this challenge, our research focuses on generating patterns from proteins with rigid prosthetic groups. Since these groups are key elements of protein active sites, the generated 3D patterns are expected to be biologically meaningful. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a new approach which allows the generation of 3D patterns from proteins with rigid prosthetic groups. Using 237 protein chains representing proteins containing porphyrin rings, our method was validated by comparing 3D templates generated from homologues with the 3D structure of the proteins they model. Atom positions were predicted reliably: 93% of them had an accuracy of 1.00 A or less. Moreover, similar results were obtained regarding chemical group and cavity positions. Results also suggested our system could contribute to the validation of 3D protein models. Finally, a 3D template was generated for the active site of human cytochrome P450 CYP17, the 3D structure of which is unknown. Its analysis showed that it is biologically meaningful: our method detected the main patterns of the cytochrome P450 superfamily and the motifs linked to catalytic reactions. The 3D template also suggested the position of a residue, which could be involved in a hydrogen bond with CYP17 substrates and the shape and location of a cavity. Comparisons with independently generated 3D models comforted these hypotheses.

Subjects were assigned to an HMB/KIC (3 g HMB and 0.3 g alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, daily) or placebo treatment for 14 d prior to exercise in the counter-balanced crossover design. One repetition maximum (1RM), plasma creatine kinase activity (CK), delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), limb girth, and range of motion (ROM) were determined pre-exercise, at 1h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-exercise. DOMS and the percentage changes in 1RM, limb girth, and ROM all changed over the 72 h period (P \u003c 0.05). HMB//IC supplementation attenuated the CK response, the percentage decrement in 1RM, and the percentage increase in limb girth (P \u003c 0.05). In addition, DOMS was reduced at 24 h post-exercise (P \u003c 0.05) in the HMB/KIC treatment.

Weakness as a primary impairment of neuromuscular diseases is addressed, with recognition of the phenomenon of disuse atrophy, and how weakness impacts on the functional abilities of people with myopathy and neuropathy. Interventions to reduce weakness or address the functional consequences of weakness are evaluated with consideration of safety and clinical application. LEARNING OUTCOMES: This paper will allow readers to: (1) appraise the contribution of research in rehabilitation of lower motor neuron weakness to clinical decision making and (2) engage with the issues that arise when researching rehabilitation interventions for lower motor neuron weakness. AIM OF ARTICLE: Impairments associated with neuromuscular conditions can lead to significant functional difficulties that can impact on a person\u0027s daily participation. This article focuses on the primary impairment of weakness and explores the research evidence for rehabilitation interventions that directly influence weakness or address the impact of weakness on function.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ramdharry, Gita M"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":55959,"sim:weight":0.231514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.13532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.1283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.127093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.105683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.102141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.0981034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Exercise intervention studies carry the caveat that the results are limited to volunteers with good compliance and completion profiles.\r\n\r\nObjectives: This study aimed to identify characteristics contributing to adherence vs non-adherence to prescribed supervised 10-week 75-minute aerobic and progressive resistance exercise programme in a clinical setting that requires twice-weekly attendance at the physiotherapy gym.\r\n\r\nStudy Design: This observational study was comprised of 11 males and 11 females, physician-assessed, HIV seropositive patients referred to exercise programmes in a tertiary multi-disciplinary outpatient service for HIV patients at an urban Teaching Hospital in London (UK). Measurements taken prior to the exercise programme were used as dependent variables and include CD4 count, fitness level, flexibility and perceived physical-, emotional-, functional- and psychological- well-being. Attendance records were categorised into a dichotomous independent variable of adherence based on a natural break that occurred at 8/20 attended sessions.\r\n\r\nResults: Prior-to-treatment differences in perceived physical, functional and psychological well-being exist between adherent and non-adherent patients, but no differences were found in age, CD4 count or fitness level. Perceived wellbeing explained 55.7% of the variances in attendance. Gender and reason for referral appear to be independent of adherence, whereas ethnicity may play an influential role.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Perceived well-being appears to differentiate between adherent and non-adherent patients. Further studies are required to investigate other psychological characteristics and barriers to maintaining exercise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petroczi, Andrea","Hawkins, Kim","Jones, Gareth","Naughton, Declan"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.370893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76297,"sim:weight":0.364151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.332007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.326083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.324883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.316597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708124,"sim:weight":0.313752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86101,"sim:weight":0.304542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.303382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.300772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631760,"sim:weight":0.280852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75341,"sim:weight":0.273019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.272299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.271307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.271307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.261449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.254995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.250218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.250218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101310,"sim:weight":0.243114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It will seek to examine this concern, and draw conclusions about its relevance with some suggestions for further research and discussion.\r\n\r\nThe paper has two broad areas of study, those of culture in general, and language in particular.\r\n\r\nAn investigation of the language used within the production of valuations produces an interesting diversity of meanings for the same words from different English sources.  This leads to a variety of confusions within published works which too often seem to assume meanings that are far from clear.  When these terms are then translated into foreign languages, real problems are encountered.  Even when a single English meaning can be agreed upon, there is frequently no direct comparison in European languages [the paper tends to focus on German], which leads to severe problems of application.  There seems to be genuine cause for concern in the application of English [British] valuation techniques under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nValuation terminology is clearly the product of the 250 years of development of economic thought since Adam Smith.  The concepts of value clearly fall within those ideas developed by the neo /classical schools.  There is thus a worry over the application of these techniques into economies that are not the product of Smith and his descendants, whose cultures are different.  Here rules, norms and social perceptions make English valuation techniques an alien invader of traditional values.  The resulting conflict may follow many routes, but is clearly a fundamental problem.  Thus, language differences tend to signify major cultural ones that may provide major obstacles to the application of valuation techniques.\r\n\r\nThe paper then attempts to unify these two concerns into a valuation model.  It draws from philosophy the notions of the private and public spheres of existence, and uses these to argue that there is a value fraction to all valuations that can only be seen in terms of a personal non-market value.  These personal values can be literally personal, or seen as national (cultural) norms on value.  Valuation techniques fail to recognise the \r\n\r\n\r\nimportance of these non-market values which are the result of utility and pleasure rather than price, cost or profitability.  Serious consequences may flow from this inability or oversight.\r\n\r\nThe paper does not present clear-cut answers, but expresses doubts over the universal application across cultural boundaries of valuation techniques, and indeed, both the overwhelming desire and the practical ability to seek such values.","bibo:AuthorList":["Eccles, Tim"],"dc:date":"1993-07-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85729,"sim:weight":0.340954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176841,"sim:weight":0.32214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.289657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.275528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.27128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.260796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108856,"sim:weight":0.253458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.247304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.244996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.243811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.178984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the United Kingdom, water has recently been privatised.  The State has sold its apparatus for water provision to private shareholders who seek to provide the service at a profit to themselves.  This is a clear example of commodification; of valuing water in terms of a good available in the market at the market price.  Water must thus be seen, and treated, as a good for sale with a range of other items competing for limited purchasing power.\r\n\r\nIn mainland Europe, the State maintains a regulatory control over the supply of water, but the staunch commercialism personified by the British position is still present.  This paper seeks to explain the process through which this attitude arose.  To do so, it takes from philosophy the theoretical constructs used to explain how societies arise.  It does, however, apply these to a practical discussion of land/water management issues.\r\n\r\nWithin this framework, management of such a key asset is extremely important and operates as a serious programme of both theory and practice.  The provision of such an asset is seen as an area of intense political and economic action.  The importance of this managerial attention is not disputed herein, but the process whereby such a position has been reached is described.  This admittedly stylised discussion seeks to outline the process whereby water, a freely available necessity which literally falls from the sky, has been turned into a marketable commodity for sale to those who can afford to pay for it.

This took the form of a codified body of knowledge, a division of specialisms amongst institutions, code of ethics and behaviour and modes of doing business.

I recorded much of this material during the creation of a soundtrack for a theatre production of The Yellow Wallpaper, based on the novel by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. A site-specific production of the theatre adaptation was directed by Rob Drummer and performed at the Manchester Museum in May 2008. While composing the soundtrack I was fascinated by the intricate sonic details present in the closely recorded paper and was keen to explore their potential further in a standalone acousmatic concert work. \r\n\r\nAs a result, Papyrus explores the wide variety of spatial motions, trajectories and perspectives which can be created through the manipulation of this seemingly simple and lifeless material.

{"identifier":1535744,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Composition","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Bosonica","bibo:abstract":"In theoretical physics, ‘Bosonic’ refers to the original version of ‘string theory’, developed in the 1960s. Although the initial hypotheses behind Bosonic String Theory have since been expanded and modified, the underlying principle remains intact; that the various properties of matter and force can be a reflection of the ways in which a string vibrates. The oscillating properties of these hypothetical strings determine the properties of particles and all forms of energy. As such, the theory proposes that the entire world may be composed of these infinitely small vibrating ‘strings’.  \r\nBosonica is a sonic exploration of the concepts behind this theory. The sound material which underpins the work is predominantly sourced from stringed instruments, in particular piano, guitar (acoustic and electric) and cello. At times the original properties of these vibrating strings are very present and recognisable, however the work explores increasing blurring and abstraction, creating new constructions from the original material and presenting to the listener dense and abstract dimensions. Despite this, the untreated instrumental material consistently returns as a reminder that it serves as the building block from which all other material is derived. The use of 5.1 spatialisation magnifies the perceived kinetic energy of material. Small gestural fragments are scattered over the 5.1 array to form accumulative trajectories of sound, and the listener becomes immersed in the dark abstract landscapes generated by the sounds of strings.  \r\nThe work was composed in 2009 in the Electroacoustic Music Studios of the University of Manchester, UK.

From a bolt of lightning, to mains electricity, unexpected sparks of static to the electric pulses within the human sensory system, our experience of electricity is constantly mutating.  It is an inherently organic phenomenon, hence the reference to nerve in the title, yet it is now applied within mainly man-made contexts, as mains electricity – a tool – resulting in its confused personality.  I wanted to create a piece which presented electricity as a animate presence, and also reflected a slightly sinister element through ideas of instability.\r\n\r\nBroken Nerve explores a notion of \u0027flux\u0027 associated with electricity.  Its multi-faceted existence is created in the music through many interacting layers of sound.  The interruptive (\u0027broken\u0027) nature of electricity is mirrored through sudden interjections of seemingly uncontrolled sparks, which articulate and also act as catalysts to textual change. The listener experiences a number of oppositions throughout the work; order and disorder, micro and macro structures, the seemingly tangible alongside the invisible.  Implied organic gestural qualities break through, for example the sweeping storm of energy towards the end. However, the \u0027hum\u0027 of earth presents a strand (‘nerve’) of relative continuity and stability within this environment, and is a returning motif.  \r\n\r\nThe sound material for this piece was gathered from metallic objects, improvisation using bare wires and a mixing desk, and recording arc welding.

The original unprocessed material of the thumb piano is pulled apart and stretched into disparate elements, creating distant artificial constructs.\r\n\r\nA key concept in this work is the idea of ‘human intervention’ or ‘the human hand’.

However, investigations of such differentials among people aged 65 and over is still comparatively rare. In this issue of the journal Huisman et al report on the results of their analyses of socioeconomic status (housing tenure, education) and mortality among older people. These were based on data from mortality registries linked with population census data from 11 European countries and regions. Institutionalised populations were not included.\r\nTheir results indicate that absolute and relative socioeconomic inequalities in mortality persisted into old age among men and women, and that relative socioeconomic inequalities in mortality were as great among older as middle aged people in some populations, although the age pattern of relative inequalities differed between populations by sex. However, an association between socioeconomic status and mortality was still present in the oldest age groups (90+). Their pooled data show that absolute socioeconomic mortality inequalities increased with age, while relative socioeconomic mortality inequalities generally decreased with age, although there were international variations in patterns. Overall, socioeconomic inequalities in relation to housing tenure were smaller than with education in the two oldest age groups. The authors conclude such inequalities are an important public health problem in Europe. \r\n\r\nThe issue of socioeconomic inequalities in morbidity, as well as mortality, has attracted a large number of investigators, but comparatively few have focused on elderly populations. By including the very old age groups, the study by Huisman makes a significant contribution to the literature on inequalities and mortality, and emphasises the importance of considering older people in public health policy and actions. It is a topic of increasing importance given the aging populations in developed countries, and increases in life expectancy, and given that most people who die and who are in poor health are aged over 60.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bowling, Ann"],"dc:date":"2004-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83480,"sim:weight":0.374079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66882,"sim:weight":0.353766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27362,"sim:weight":0.33033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65495,"sim:weight":0.321015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.308754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.224072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83383,"sim:weight":0.219926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91804,"sim:weight":0.195792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108302,"sim:weight":0.189588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56993,"sim:weight":0.151279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The data on processes and attitudes are presented here. DESIGN: Self administered questionnaires were drawn up for patients, their general practitioners (GPs) and specialists, and managers in the practice. Information was sought from hospital trusts. The study formed a pilot phase prior to a wider evaluation. SETTING: Nine outreach clinics in general practices in England, each with a hospital outpatient department as a control clinic were studied. SUBJECTS: The specialties included were ear, nose, and throat surgery; rheumatology; and gynaecology. The subjects were the patients who attended either the outreach clinics or hospital outpatients clinics during the study period, the outreach patients\u0027 GPs, the outreach patients\u0027 and outpatients\u0027 specialists, the managers in the practices, and the NHS trusts which employed the specialists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Process items included waiting lists, waiting times in clinics, number of follow up visits, investigations and procedures performed, treatment, health status, patients\u0027 and specialists\u0027 travelling times, and patients\u0027 and doctors\u0027 attitudes to, and satisfaction with, the clinic. RESULTS: There was no difference in the health status of patients in relation to the clinic site (ie, outreach and hospital outpatients\u0027 clinics) at baseline, and all but one of the specialists said there were no differences in casemix between their outreach and outpatients\u0027 clinics. Patients preferred, and were more satisfied with, care in specialists\u0027 outreach clinics in general practice, in comparison with outpatients\u0027 clinics. The outreach clinics were rated as more convenient than outpatients\u0027 clinics in relation to journey times; those outreach patients in work lost less time away from work than outpatients\u0027 clinic patients due to the clinic attendance. Length of time on the waiting list was significantly reduced for gynaecology patients; waiting times in clinics were lower for outreach patients than outpatients across all specialties. In addition, outreach patients were more likely to be first rather than follow up attenders; rheumatology outreach patients were more likely than hospital outpatients to receive therapy. GPs\u0027 referrals to hospital outpatients\u0027 clinics were greatly reduced by the availability of outreach clinics. Both specialists and GPs saw the main advantages of outreach clinics in relation to the greater convenience and better access to care for patients. Few of the specialists and GPs in the outreach practices held formal training and education sessions in the outreach clinic, although over half of the GPs felt that their skills/expertise had broadened as a result of the outreach clinic. CONCLUSIONS: The processes of care (waiting times, patient satisfaction, convenience to patients, follow up attendances) were better in outreach than in outpatients\u0027 clinics. However, waiting lists were only significantly reduced for gynaecology patients, despite both GPs and consultants reporting reduced waiting lists for patients as one of the main advantages of outreach. Whether these improvements merit the increased cost to the specialists (in terms of their increased travelling times and time spent away from their hospital base) and whether the development of what is, in effect, two standards of care between practices with and without outreach can be stemmed and the standard of care raised in all practices (eg, by sharing outreach clinics between GPs in an area) remain the subject of debate. As the data were based on the pilot study, the results should be viewed with some caution, although statistical power was adequate for comparisons of sites if not specialties.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bowling, Ann","Stramer, Katia","Dickinson, Edward","Windsor, Joy","Bond, Matthew"],"dc:date":"1997-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":325339,"sim:weight":0.346177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448025,"sim:weight":0.248345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555506,"sim:weight":0.215301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929976,"sim:weight":0.192847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.192143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.186958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.17705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.159845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2753332,"sim:weight":0.132779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.125121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90683,"sim:weight":0.108666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

DESIGN AND SETTING: The vehicle for the study was the Office for National Statistics (ONS) omnibus survey in Great Britain. The sampling frame was the British post-code address file of \u0026quot;small users\u0026quot;, stratified by region, and socioeconomic factors. This file includes all private household addresses. The postal sectors were selected with probability proportional to size. Within each sector 30 addresses were selected randomly. The number of selected addresses was 3000. PARTICIPANTS: Altogether 1912 adults aged 16 and over were interviewed in person in their own homes, giving a response rate of 72%. MEASURES: The HSQ-12, and the ONS general household survey questions on longstanding illness; the ONS omnibus standard sociodemographic items. MAIN RESULTS: There were exceptionally high rates of item response in all age groups. The score differences by construct (e.g., age group, sex, longstanding illness) were in the expected directions with statistically significant age gradients. Age was associated with most of the HSQ-12 domains, although this association had interactions with longstanding illness or sex. The differences in HSQ-12 scores with reported longstanding illness and type of longstanding illness made theoretical sense, which supports the discriminative power of the scale. The frequency distributions for HSQ-12 items in relation to age and sex, and by reporting of longstanding illness are also presented here in order to demonstrate ceiling effects. Most respondents in all age groups achieved high (good) scores on the \u0026quot;social functioning\u0026quot; subscale. The HSQ-12 had good results for specificity when tested against reporting of a longstanding illness, although this was at the expense of sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of the HSQ-12 with older populations, particularly for those with chronic illnesses, although it will reveal relatively few problems among younger populations. The results presented here indicate that it will require supplementation with more sensitive disease and/or domain specific scales in the areas of interest or intervention, but it provides an acceptable, brief, core measure of health related quality of life.

{"identifier":1537631,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Sensorimotor changes and functional performance in patients with knee osteoarthritis","bibo:abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Muscles are essential components of our sensorimotor system that help maintain balance and perform a smooth gait, but it is unclear whether arthritic damage adversely affects muscle sensorimotor function. Quadriceps sensorimotor function in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) was investigated, and whether these changes were associated with impairment of functional performance. METHODS: Quadriceps strength, voluntary activation, and proprioceptive acuity (joint position sense acuity) were assessed in 103 patients with knee OA and compared with 25 healthy control subjects. In addition, their postural stability, objective functional performance (the aggregate time for four activities of daily living), and disabilities (lequesne index) were also investigated. RESULTS: Compared with the control subjects, the patients with knee OA had weaker quadriceps (differences between group mean 100N, CI 136, 63N), poorer voluntary activation (20% CI 13, 25%) that was associated with quadriceps weakness, and impaired acuity of knee joint position sense (1.28 degrees, CI 0.84, 1.73 degrees). As a group the patients were more unstable (p \u003d 0.0017), disabled (10, CI 7, 11), and had poorer functional performance (19.6 seconds, CI 14.3, 24.9 seconds). The most important predictors of disability were objective functional performance and quadriceps strength. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with knee OA, articular damage may reduce quadriceps motoneurone excitability, which decreases voluntary quadriceps activation thus contributing to quadriceps weakness, and diminishes proprioceptive acuity. The arthrogenic impairment in quadriceps sensorimotor function and decreased postural stability was associated with reduced functional performance of the patients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hurley, Michael V","Scott, David L","Rees, Joanne","Newham, Di J"],"dc:date":"1997-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.273635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26442,"sim:weight":0.19321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.107761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1395323,"sim:weight":0.104278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26590,"sim:weight":0.103431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57381,"sim:weight":0.103051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5847038,"sim:weight":0.097389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.0886613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Books can be transferred between people. Knowledge is more complex. Knowledge transfer is not a linear process managed by administrators. It is a matter of culture change, with knowledge as integral to the culture.\r\nKnowledge is socially constituted, and not simply held by individuals. Explicit knowledge is only the tip of the iceberg. We need to address implicit knowledge, and most importantly, tacit knowledge. Knowledge is acquired through shared experience, typically by involvement in a particular form of life, with distinctive language games.\r\nOn this basis, it is important to create environments in which experience can be shared, and where knowledge can be given practical meaning. In the context of innovation, we can seek to develop innovation systems, contexts in which new ideas can be developed and applied. \r\nIn the context of the workplace, we need to facilitate dialogue, and partnership arrangements which engage the local actors, as well as the social partners and external research resources.\r\nThe paper considers four new structures for work organisation which enable experience to be shared, ideas applied, and knowledge acquired: Studentsï¿½ Quality Circles, Senior Quality Circles, Forum Theatre, and Network Consultancy.

Social networks tie individuals together and online social networking services enable these ties through technology. People flock to web sites like Facebook, MySpace, and Tribe.net to keep in touch with friends, interest groups and family, communicate and share news about them.  User friendliness of social networking technology has popularised SNSs and a growing body of research suggest various applications of social networking sites in higher education settings (for an overview see Benson, Filippaios and Morgan, 2010).  Some practitioners view social networking services as a future platform for lifelong learning stretching beyond the virtual wall of institutional learning management systems.  Furthermore, online social networking has been praised for its social capital potential beneficial for building professional connections and successful career management (Benson \u0026 Filippaios, 2010). \r\n Students, overwhelmingly comfortable with social technology, are already networking with classmates on Facebook, etc. and the thought of employing this familiar platform for learning and teaching has been tested by many HE institutions. However, issues arising from mixing informal communication platform with formal professional networking with potential employers and instructors are plenty.  The prospect of personal content becoming available to the outsiders of an informal social circle is highly likely, is only one of the problem areas. This paper addresses the phenomenon of Public and Private Dichotomy, i.e. contextualisation of private and public content including communication and media shared through online social networks.

Previous studies have suggested locusts as a tractable model in which to study Acanthamoeba pathogenesis. Here we determined the mode of parasite invasion of the central nervous system (CNS).\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nUsing Acanthamoeba isolates belonging to the T1 and T4 genotypes, the findings revealed that amoebae induced sickness behaviour in locusts, as evidenced by reduced faecal output and weight loss and, eventually, leading to 100% mortality. Significant degenerative changes of various tissues were observed by histological sectioning. Both isolates produced disseminated infection, with viable amoebae being recovered from various tissues. Histological examination of the CNS showed that Acanthamoeba invaded the locust CNS, and this is associated with disruption of the perineurium cell/glial cell complex, which constitutes the locust blood-brain barrier.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n\r\nThis is the first study to demonstrate that Acanthamoeba invades locust brain by modulating the integrity of the insect\u0027s blood-brain barrier, a finding that is consistent with the human infection. These observations support the idea that locusts provide a tractable model to study Acanthamoeba encephalitis in vivo. In this way the locust model may generate potentially useful leads that can be tested subsequently in mammalian systems, thus replacing the use of vertebrates at an early stage, and reducing the numbers of mammals required overall.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mortazavi, Parisa N","Goldsworthy, Graham","Kirk, Ruth","Khan, Naveed A"],"dc:date":"2010-07-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Empirical testing of both is dominated by self-report questionnaires, which is the most widely used method in psychological assessments and sociology polls. Disturbingly, the potential distorting effect of socially desirable responding (SD) is seldom considered in doping research, or dismissed based on weak correlation between some SD measure and the variables of interest. The aim of this report is to draw attention to i) the potential distorting effect of SD and ii) the limitation of using correlation analysis between a SD measure and the individual measures. Models of doping opinion as a potentially contentious issue was tested using structural equation modeling technique (SEM) with and without the SD variable, on a dataset of 278 athletes, assessing the SD effect both at the i) indicator and ii) construct levels, as well as iii) testing SD as an independent variable affecting expressed doping opinion. Participants were categorised by their SD score into high- and low SD groups. Based on low correlation coefficients (\u003c|0.22|) observed in the overall sample, SD effect on the indicator variables could be disregarded. Regression weights between predictors and the outcome variable varied between groups with high and low SD but despite the practically non-existing relationship between SD and predictors (\u003c|0.11|) in the low SD group, both groups showed improved model fit with SD, independently. The results of this study clearly demonstrate the presence of SD effect and the inadequacy of the commonly used pairwise correlation to assess social desirability at model level. In the absence of direct observation of the target behaviour (i.e. doping use), evaluation of the effectiveness of future anti-doping campaign, along with empirical testing of refined doping behavioural models, will likely to continue to rely on self-reported information. Over and above controlling the effect of socially desirable responding in research that makes inferences based on self-reported information on social cognitive and behavioural measures, it is recommended that SD effect is appropriately assessed during data analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petroczi, Andrea","Nepusz, Tamas"],"dc:date":"2011-01-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":245586,"sim:weight":0.757902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539442,"sim:weight":0.626711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90134,"sim:weight":0.619645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91239,"sim:weight":0.598393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90262,"sim:weight":0.568276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90504,"sim:weight":0.500677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.2951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.282905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.256603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.255597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.216087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.211039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.207731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19143,"sim:weight":0.108329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study explores how the learning style of second language learners may be associated with this variability. The participants are first year university students of engineering. Vocabulary from their report writing is analysed for the amount of lexical recycling which occurs in their texts. This is done by using a measure of lexical diversity which calculates a mathematical curve fitting procedure to model the fall of the type-token ratio in order to give a value, parameter D. Learning style is based on Skehanï¿½s (1998) memory-analysis framework. The participants are tested for associative memory of unfamiliar words and grammatical sensitivity of an unknown language. The results suggest that L2 learners who show extreme lexical diversity (either high recycling or low recycling of vocabulary), are related to low grammatical awareness and high associative memory. The implication for teaching and learning is that although non-native speakers of English may use technical vocabulary in a quantitatively similar manner to native speakers, some may need to notice the complexity and coherence in L2.","bibo:AuthorList":["Booth, P."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108929,"sim:weight":0.40558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85336,"sim:weight":0.322898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108341,"sim:weight":0.307231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108290,"sim:weight":0.291781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.290716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.282961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4188086,"sim:weight":0.252955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99358,"sim:weight":0.248795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17863,"sim:weight":0.245299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.241012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.202774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.171458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We choose China and India as a representative of emerging markets to examine if the quantity of crude oil imported by China and India is significant in the existing oil pricing system (Kaufmann et.al. (2004). Our data starts from January 2002 and ends in March 2010 which includes the oil shock of 2007-2008. We utilize cointegration and Error-Correction-Model framework developed by Engle-Granger (1987) and Gregory-Hansen (1996) in the analysis. Our results indicate that demand from emerging market has become a significant factor in the world oil pricing system since 2003. This result is significant as it lends empirical support to the widely held conjecture that the oil shock of 2007-2008 is a demand-led shock (Hamilton, 2009).

The emerging market factor is there to stay and reflects the changing power between emerging and developed economies in the world economic system as a result of decades of fast economic development in the former.

Having confidence in the validity and reliability of such data is vital.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sample of 82 athletes from 30 sports (52.4% female, mean age: 21.48±2.86 years) was split into quasi-experimental groups based on i) self-admitted previous experience with prohibited performance enhancing drugs (PED) and ii) the presence of at least one prohibited PED in hair covering up to 6 months prior to data collection. Participants responded to questionnaires assessing a range of social cognitive determinants of doping via self-reports; and completed a modified version of the Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT) assessing implicit attitudes to doping relative to the acceptable nutritional supplements (NS). Social projection regarding NS was used as control. PEDs were detected in hair samples from 10 athletes (12% prevalence), none of whom admitted doping use. This group of \u0027deniers\u0027 was characterised by a dissociation between explicit (verbal declarations) and implicit (BIAT) responding, while convergence was observed in the \u0027clean\u0027 athlete group. This dissociation, if replicated, may act as a cognitive marker of the denier group, with promising applications of the combined explicit-implicit cognitive protocol as a proxy in lieu of biochemical detection methods in social science research. Overall, discrepancies in the relationship between declared doping-related opinion and implicit doping attitudes were observed between the groups, with control measures remaining unaffected. Questionnaire responses showed a pattern consistent with self-reported doping use.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Following our preliminary work, this study provides further evidence that both self-reports on behaviour and social cognitive measures could be affected by some form of response bias. This can question the validity of self-reports, with reliability remaining unaffected. Triangulation of various assessment methods is recommended.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petroczi, Andrea","uvacsek, Martina","Nepusz, Tamas","Deshmukh, Nawed","Shah, Iltaf","Aidman, Eugene","Barker, James","Toth, Miklos","Naughton, Declan"],"dc:date":"2011-04-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90504,"sim:weight":0.691402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539253,"sim:weight":0.626711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":245586,"sim:weight":0.482347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.273502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.254322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.232933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.229315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26758,"sim:weight":0.217303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.211349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.211349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.207615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.200803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.195838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.188431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.187421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.163403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2745396,"sim:weight":0.15333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177203,"sim:weight":0.0528293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is particularly the case in Art and Design Faculties, since many courses have a vocational or professional focus. While genres within some fields are clearly defined by academics, in others studentsï¿½ creativity is prioritised.  Therefore, some discourse communities within this faculty do not require the same degree of conformity to norms as many in academia (Hyland 2004). The divergency of this context may be extreme, but I would argue it is becoming increasingly normal.  It is therefore increasingly challenging to design in-sessional EAP courses. \r\nOne solution to this problem is to continue to ï¿½pin downï¿½ each genre, delivering ever more focused courses.  Another might be to teach English for General Academic Purposes (EGAP).  However, each carries its own disadvantages.  A more promising option is to develop university valued key  skills alongside EAP skills by developing studentsï¿½ ability to unpack texts, recognise differences, identify and articulate preferences; and therefore teaching them our skills along with our knowledge.  This would help sensitise them to the creativity of choice in communication. I am therefore proposing that we view students less as apprentice academics and more as researchers in order to develop their literacies (Bhatia, 2002) in the broadest sense. \r\nThis move involves shifting more responsibility for learning onto students, but this in mimics the general university environment. Furthermore, including more open-ended tasks in classes may prove more engaging. Though this shift may not necessarily be universally valued, it arguably equips students with the skills to deal with the contemporary shift in higher education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hurley, Karen"],"dc:date":"2011-04-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.397211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.368264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.337519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1559155,"sim:weight":0.333879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85165,"sim:weight":0.315031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.30672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.298669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.291344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.276011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2754878,"sim:weight":0.268843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We use a multivariate GARCH-BEKK model and a series of likelihood ratio tests to uncover China’s regional and global linkages between 1992 and 2010 and during three sub-periods representing stages of the Chinese reforms. The results show that China is linked to the overseas markets through return and volatility spillovers and the reforms permit spillovers from China to the overseas markets. The regression analysis of the derived time-varying conditional correlations during 1992-2010 further indicates that the linkages between China and the regional markets increase due to the implementation of the liberalisation policies. However, the market correlation between China and the US remains weak although it responds positively to the reforms too.

Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) has been shown to facilitate accurate separation and quantification of the major circulating metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 (25OHD3) and 25-hydroxyvitamin-D2 (25OHD2) collectively termed as 25OHD. However, among other interferents, this method may be compromised by overlapping peaks and identical masses of epimers and isobars, resulting in inaccuracies in circulating 25OHD measurements. The aim of this study was to develop a novel LC-MS/MS method that can accurately identify and quantitate 25OHD3 and 25OHD2 through chromatographic separation of 25OHD from its epimers and isobars. \r\nMethods\r\nA positive ion electrospray ionisation (ESI) LC-MS/MS method was used in the Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode for quantification. It involved i) liquid-liquid extraction, ii) tandem columns (a high resolution ZORBAX C18 coupled to an ULTRON chiral, with guard column and inlet filter), iii) Stanozolol-D3 as internal standard, and iv) identification via ESI and monitoring of three fragmentation transitions. To demonstrate the practical usefulness of our method, blood samples were collected from 5 healthy male Caucasian volunteers; age range 22 to 37 years and 25OHD2, 25OHD3 along with co-eluting epimers and analogues were quantified. \r\nResults\r\nThe new method allowed chromatographic separation and quantification of 25OHD2, 25OHD3, along with 25OHD3 epimer 3-epi-25OHD3 and isobars 1-alpha-hydroxyvitamin-D3 (1alphaOHD3), and 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (7alphaC4). The new assay was capable of detecting 0.25 ng/mL of all analytes in serum. \r\nConclusions\r\nTo our knowledge, this is the first specific, reliable, reproducible and robust LC-MS/MS method developed for the accurate detection of 25OHD (Vitamin D). The method is capable of detecting low levels of 25OHD3 and 25OHD2 together with chromatographic separation from the co-eluting epimers and isobars and circumvents other instrumental/analytical interferences. This analytical method does not require time-consuming derivatisation and complex extraction techniques and could prove very useful in clinical studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shah, Iltaf","James, Ricky","Barker, James","Petroczi, Andrea","Naughton, Declan"],"dc:date":"2011-04-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.331493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.327305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":677271,"sim:weight":0.322061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":692523,"sim:weight":0.286536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631765,"sim:weight":0.284186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.262076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.261606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.258372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.247771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26546,"sim:weight":0.216374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76066,"sim:weight":0.213428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76149,"sim:weight":0.209008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.20515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.201684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.199611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.195297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.193261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.188586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333971,"sim:weight":0.186933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.185251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To date, no attempt has been made to quantitatively explore athletes\u0027 mental representation of doping in relation to illegality and functionality. \r\nMethods\r\nA convenience sample of student athletes from a large South-Eastern Australian university responded to an online survey. Competitive athletes (n\u003d46) were grouped based on self-reported use as follows: i) none used (30%), ii) supplement only (22%), iii) illicit only (26%) and iv) both supplements and illicit drug use (22%). Whereas no athlete reported doping, data provided on projected supplement-, doping- and drug use by the four user groups allowed evaluation of doping-related cognition in the context of self reported supplement- and illicit drug taking behaviour; and comparison between these substances. \r\nResults\r\nA significantly higher prevalence estimation was found for illicit drug use and a trend towards a biased social projection emerged for supplement use. Doping estimates by user groups showed mixed results, suggesting that doping had more in common with the ergogenic nutritional supplement domain than the illicit drug domain. \r\nConclusions\r\nAssessing the behavioural domain to which doping belongs to in athletes\u0027 minds would greatly advance doping behaviour research toward prevention and intervention.

It also limits diameters of differentiating renal tubules, with mutation of certain components of the pathway causing cystic kidneys. Mutations in mouse Vangl genes encoding core PCP proteins cause neural tube defects (NTDs) and Vangl2 mutations also impair branching of embryonic mouse lung airways. Embryonic metanephric kidneys also undergo branching morphogenesis and Vangl2 is known to be expressed in ureteric bud/collecting duct and metanephric mesenchymal/nephron lineages. These observations led us to investigate metanephroi in Vangl2 mutant mice, Loop-tail (Lp). Although ureteric bud formation is normal in Vangl2(Lp/Lp) embryos, subsequent in vivo and in vitro branching morphogenesis is impaired. Null mutant kidneys are short, consistent with a CE defect. Differentiating glomerular epithelia express several PCP genes (Vangl1/2, Celsr1, Scrib, Mpk1/2 and Fat4) and glomeruli in Vangl2(Lp/Lp) fetuses are smaller and contain less prominent capillary loops than wild-type littermates. Furthermore, Vangl2(Lp/+) kidneys had modest reduction in glomerular numbers postnatally. Vangl2(Lp/Lp) metanephroi contained occasional dilated tubules but no overt cystic phenotype. These data show for the first time that a PCP gene is required for normal morphogenesis of both the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme-derived structures. It has long been recognized that certain individuals with NTDs are born with malformed kidneys, and recent studies have discovered VANGL mutations in some NTD patients. On the basis of our mutant mouse study, we suggest that PCP pathway mutations should be sought when NTD and renal malformation co-exist.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yates, Laura","Papakrivopoulou, Jenny","Long, David","Goggolidou, Paraskevi","O.Connoly, John","Woolf, Adrian","Dean, Charlotte"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1644031,"sim:weight":0.370844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75865,"sim:weight":0.340154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.308486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222898,"sim:weight":0.28673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":245630,"sim:weight":0.285658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.258827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77074,"sim:weight":0.254423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643987,"sim:weight":0.253095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631895,"sim:weight":0.247233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.244418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.243752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.240583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.233346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.230989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75928,"sim:weight":0.225054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76007,"sim:weight":0.220628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76737,"sim:weight":0.217979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76581,"sim:weight":0.214807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75441,"sim:weight":0.212842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.212201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The UK has been creating clinical career structures for nurses that include innovative posts known as nurse consultants. While the numbers overall appear to have grown over the last eleven years, there is evidence that in some specialities and regions the numbers are decreasing. This paper considers the factors that sustain or curtail workforce innovations through the case example of a cohort of nurse consultants established in one community health service in England.\r\n\r\nMETHODS:\r\n\r\nA mixed method case study evaluation was undertaken over three years, using interviews, observations, documentary analysis and questionnaires. The final element of data collection was obtained three years later. Data was anonymised, analysed using a framework method and then integrated using a narrative synthesis.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nTen nurse consultant posts were created over a period of two years (2002-2004). Within two years only five posts remained and within five years (2009) only two part time posts, with the original appointees, remained. When the nurse consultants left their posts, these were not replaced. In exploring the interaction between the innovation (the nurse consultant posts), the adoptees (the senior staff in the organisation) and the context (the immediate service colleagues, the service organisation and commissioners as well as the broader NHS policy context) three key factors were identified as influential in the demise of the posts. These were: a) the extent to which there was support for individual nurses rather than the post, b) the extent to which there was an unambiguous and uncontested clinical service requirement for a nurse consultant and c) the extent to which finances for the post were judged as being used to best effect in a service setting.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n\r\nThis case study example demonstrates how tantalisingly close the nurse consultant initiative came to achieving a clinical career pathway for nurses in community services but more work was required to normalise clinician and managers\u0027 beliefs in the relevance and need for the role. Those looking to embed these types of nursing workforce innovations should pay due regard to these issues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Drennan, Vari M","Goodman, Claire"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":192553,"sim:weight":0.318082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this article, we investigate whether intrinsic motivation affects the sorting of employees between the private and the public sectors, paying particular attention to whether extrinsic rewards crowd out intrinsic motivation. Using British longitudinal data, we find that individuals are attracted to the public sector by the intrinsic rather than the extrinsic rewards that the sector offers. We also find evidence supporting the intrinsic motivation crowding out hypothesis, in that, higher extrinsic rewards reduce the propensity of intrinsically motivated individuals to accept public sector employment. This is, however, only true for two segments of the UK public sector: the higher education sector and the National Health Service. Although our findings inform the literature on public service motivation, they also pose the question whether lower extrinsic rewards could increase the average quality of job matches in the public sector, thus improving performance without the need for high-powered incentives.","bibo:AuthorList":["Georgellis, Yannis","Iossa, Elisabetta","Tabvuma, Vurain"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108904,"sim:weight":0.209213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.146272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

If people drop out of studies - which older people are more likely to do - the value of the study diminishes.  This research draws on evidence from ongoing and previous longitudinal studies of people aged 55 and over to examine what factors encourage the retention of participants and what causes them to drop out.  The research is synthesising existing evidence, drawing together the experiences of researchers involved in longitudinal studies, and collecting some new evidence about the views of survey participants.  This article reports on the first part of the research by drawing together evidence from other studies.  These show that there are some factors which are related to attrition whereas for others the evidence is mixed.  Methods employed by these studies to reduce attrition and retain participants are examined.  It must be noted that apart from the consistent finding that attrition is associated with age, education, socio-economic status and cognitive impairment, not all studies examined the same variables; some only being explored by one study.  This makes it difficult to draw any further conclusions and indicates that attrition needs to be addressed in a uniform manner by more studies. This article identifies some implications for policy makers and practitioners.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bhamra, Suneeta","Tinker, Anthea","Mein, Gill","Ashcroft, Richard","Askham, Janet"],"dc:date":"2008-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83632,"sim:weight":0.36952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.336693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104008,"sim:weight":0.319956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27527,"sim:weight":0.297119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.294656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.289023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.285271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.234667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.234132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.223041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83172,"sim:weight":0.175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26615,"sim:weight":0.173489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, duration of response is often limited and there is currently no reliable predictive marker.Methods:We determined the sensitivity of a panel of human pancreatic tumour cell lines to treatment with afatinib, erlotinib, monoclonal antibody (mAb) ICR62, and gemcitabine, using the Sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay. The effect of these agents on cell signalling and cell-cycle distribution was determined by western blot and flow cytometry, respectively.Results:At 200 nM, ICR62 had no effect on growth of these tumour cells with the exception of BxPC-3 cells. BxPC-3 cells were also sensitive to treatment with afatinib and erlotinib with respective IC(50) values of 11 and 1200 nM. Compared with erlotinib, afatinib was also more effective in inhibiting the growth of the other human pancreatic tumour cell lines and in blocking the EGF-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine, EGFR, MAPK, and AKT. When tested in BxPC-3 xenografts, afatinib induced significant delay in tumour growth.Conclusion:The superiority of afatinib in this study encourages further investigation on the therapeutic potential of afatinib as a single agent or in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 4 October 2011; doi:10.1038/bjc.2011.396 www.bjcancer.com.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ioannou, N","Dalgleish, A G","Seddon, A M","Mackintosh, D","Guertler, U","Solca, F","Modjtahedi, H"],"dc:date":"2011-11","doi":"10.1038/bjc.2011.396","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":192839,"sim:weight":0.177114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":1541072,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Is there a danger for myopia in anti-doping education? Comparative analysis of substance use and misuse in Olympic racket sports calls for a broader approach","bibo:abstract":"BACKGROUND: Racket sports are typically not associated with doping. Despite the common characteristics of being non-contact and mostly individual, racket sports differ in their physiological demands, which might be reflected in substance use and misuse (SUM). The aim of this study was to investigate SUM among Slovenian Olympic racket sport players in the context of educational, sociodemographic and sport-specific factors.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Elite athletes (N\u003d187; mean age\u003d22±2.3; 64% male) representing one of the three racket sports, table tennis, badminton, and tennis, completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire on substance use habits. Athletes in this sample had participated in at least one of the two most recent competitions at the highest national level and had no significant difference in competitive achievement or status within their sport.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: A significant proportion of athletes (46% for both sexes) reported using nutritional supplements. Between 10% and 24% of the studied males would use doping if the practice would help them achieve better results in competition and if it had no negative health consequences; a further 5% to 10% indicated potential doping behaviour regardless of potential health hazards. Females were generally less oriented toward SUM than their male counterparts with no significant differences between sports, except for badminton players. Substances that have no direct effect on sport performance (if timed carefully to avoid detrimental effects) are more commonly consumed (20% binge drink at least once a week and 18% report using opioids), whereas athletes avoid substances that can impair and threaten athletic achievement by decreasing physical capacities (e.g. cigarettes), violating anti-doping codes or potentially transgressing substance control laws (e.g. opiates and cannabinoids). Regarding doping issues, athletes\u0027 trust in their coaches and physicians is low.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: SUM in sports spreads beyond doping-prone sports and drugs that enhance athletic performance. Current anti-doping education, focusing exclusively on rules and fair play, creates an increasingly widening gap between sports and the athletes\u0027 lives outside of sports. To avoid myopia, anti-doping programmes should adopt a holistic approach to prevent substance use in sports for the sake of the athletes\u0027 health as much as for the integrity of sports.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kondric, Miran","Sekulic, Damir","Petroczi, Andrea","Ostojic, Ljerka","Rodek, Jelena","Ostojic, Zdenko"],"dc:date":"2011-10-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90262,"sim:weight":0.581104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90134,"sim:weight":0.566068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539442,"sim:weight":0.519669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539585,"sim:weight":0.496023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91239,"sim:weight":0.478998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85266,"sim:weight":0.401703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50146,"sim:weight":0.308805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13965,"sim:weight":0.294953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23205,"sim:weight":0.195929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176845,"sim:weight":0.191794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.156689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.153874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.145988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.143821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316090,"sim:weight":0.122715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.120367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacies of three plant extracts for their potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in primary human skin fibroblasts.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Aqueous extracts and formulations of white tea, witch hazel and rose were subjected to assays to measure anti-collagenase, anti-elastase, trolox equivalent and catalase activities. Skin fibroblast cells were employed to determine the effect of each extract/formulation on IL-8 release induced by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. Microscopic examination along with Neutral Red viability testing was employed to ascertain the effects of hydrogen peroxide directly on cell viability.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Considerable anti-collagenase, anti-elastase, and antioxidant activities were measured for all extracts apart from the witch hazel distillate which showed no activity in the collagenase assay or in the trolox equivalence assay. All of the extracts and products tested elicited a significant decrease in the amount of IL-8 produced by fibroblast cells compared to the control (p \u003c 0.05). None of the test samples exhibited catalase activity or had a significant effect on the spontaneous secretion of IL-8 in the control cells which was further corroborated with the microscopy results and the Neutral Red viability test.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: These data show that the extracts and products tested have a protective effect on fibroblast cells against hydrogen peroxide induced damage. This approach provides a potential method to evaluate the claims made for plant extracts and the products in which these extracts are found.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thring, Tamsyn","Hili, Pauline","Naughton, Declan"],"dc:date":"2011-10-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91063,"sim:weight":0.542162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340567,"sim:weight":0.174298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108070,"sim:weight":0.157492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.152752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.132378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.122528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.121656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.119755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For example, stanozolol, a synthetic anabolic steroid, is frequently misused for performance enhancement as well as for illegal growth promoting purposes in veterinary practice. Previously we reported stanozolol in hair samples collected from subjects living in Budapest. For this reason we initiated this study to explore possible environmental sources of steroid contamination. The aim of this study was to develop a method to monitor stanozolol in aqueous matrices using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). \r\n\r\nResults\r\nLiquid-liquid extraction using pentane was found to be an efficient method for the extraction of stanozolol from water samples. This was followed by direct detection using LC-MS/MS. The method was capable of detecting 0.25 pg/mL stanozolol when only 5 mL water was processed in the presence of stanozolol D3 as internal standard. Fifteen bottled waters analysed were found to be negative for stanozolol. However, three out of six samples from the Danube river, collected from December \u002709 to November \u002710, were found to contain stanozolol at concentrations up to 1.82 pg/mL. In contrast, only one sample (out of six) of urban tap water from Budapest city was found to contain stanozolol, at a concentration of 1.19 pg/mL. \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe method developed is efficient, rapid, reproducible, sensitive and robust for the detection of stanozolol in aqueous matrices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Deshmukh, Nawed I K","Barker, James","Petroczi, Andrea","Naughton, Declan"],"dc:date":"2011-10-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":677271,"sim:weight":0.38605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333971,"sim:weight":0.234861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337586,"sim:weight":0.0712304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9599570,"sim:weight":0.0682916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A qualitative study of managing incontinence with people with dementia living at home","bibo:abstract":"BACKGROUND: Incontinence in people with dementia is one of the factors associated with the decision to move to a care home. Managing incontinence adds to carer burden and has been reported by family carers as more difficult to manage than behavioural symptoms. Active management strategies have been reported to be associated with less carer depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate carers\u0027 perceptions of the range of incontinence problems they helped their relative with and the strategies they employed to manage these.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Family carers of people with dementia living in their own homes were recruited through primary care, specialist community mental health services and voluntary organisations. Qualitative semi structured interviews were conducted either face to face or by telephone and thematically analysed.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Thirty two carers were interviewed. They described a range of problems from supporting the person to remain independent in toileting, through to dealing with inappropriate behaviours, to containing and managing incontinence. All carers actively used problem solving strategies but sometimes these were not acceptable or understood by the person with dementia, particularly as the dementia progressed. Most carers reported protecting the person\u0027s dignity by not seeking health professionals help often until the point of a crisis. Once the carer has decided to seek help the responses from health professionals can be less than helpful, and carers report local health service policies on access to continence products to be inconsistent and often inappropriate to their circumstances. A few carers reported strategies for managing toileting and incontinence that have the potential for distress and harm to the person with dementia.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Primary care professionals could be more proactive in enquiry, repeated over time, about toileting and incontinence problems and in giving advice and information to reduce crisis and problems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Drennan, Vari M","Cole, Laura","Iliffe, Steve"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":68602,"sim:weight":0.475265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.444007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103807,"sim:weight":0.387779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.373543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929976,"sim:weight":0.36496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107309,"sim:weight":0.30736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":326745,"sim:weight":0.268797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70031,"sim:weight":0.266888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.259648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.235205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91075,"sim:weight":0.234803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.230673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.212267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":294473,"sim:weight":0.210696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Taking examples from CLN\u0027s successful reading and research seminars, I will argue that the act of bringing together academics and practioners to debate notions of truth-telling, ethical dilemma, representations of the self and the like is not only challenging and frustrating, it is an act of translation in which something is gained as well as lost.  \r\n      \t\r\nVirginia Woolf (and many writers before and since) saw both an intellectual and a linguistic difference between the self as articulated through the academy and the autobiographical self as told through the life story. In her most autobiographical novel, To The Lighthouse, for example, the father figure, Mr Ramsay, invites his student Charles Tansley to stay with his family on St Ives. Soon after arriving, Tansley confides the tale of his difficult childhood to Mrs. Ramsay.  Later, as student and teacher talk, Mrs Ramsay overhears them, and, Woolf tells us, she \"did not catch the meaning, only the words, here and there...dissertation...fellowship...readership...lectureship.... She could not follow the ugly academic jargon...but said to herself that she saw now why [Tansley] came out, instantly, with all that about his father and mother and brothers and sisters, and she would see to it that they didn\u0027t laugh at him anymore\" (22).  Woolf envisioned this difference in discourse to be gendered and political, inscribed by historically static boundaries.  In our own century, the divide may be differently drawn, but as \"Biography\", \"Autobiography,\" and \"Life Writing\" become more widely accepted as areas of academic research, the linguistic distance between practitioner and researcher remains. By considering CLN\u0027s example in light of Woolf\u0027s academic/autobiographic split, I will ask -  when writer and theorist share a classroom or an office, or indeed a funded research project - how can they talk to each other productively?","bibo:AuthorList":["Jensen, Meg"],"dc:date":"2009-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Ballard, Virginia Woolf, Katherine Mansfield, Jack Kerouac, Louisa May Alcott and me)","bibo:abstract":"Despite recent controversies over ‘faked’ memoirs, most readers of life writing continue to trust in the autobiographical pact: they believe that memoirs are a source of personal truth, a writer’s outlet for laying bare the past. But some argue that the codes and conventions of memoir inscribe a distance between self and subject. Before writers are able to tell the truth to their readers, moreover, they have to confront and process that truth themselves over and over again. Writers of autobiographically-based fiction (or autofiction, autobiografiction) have long known that the work of truth-telling must start well before publication: the practice of writing in this form demands repeated self-revelation and intimacy with the truth of one’s own life history in a way that memoir may not.  In this essay, I embrace the self-reflective methodologies of life-writing practice in order to identify and interrogate the ways in which writers of autobiographically-based fiction, including myself, process the truth of their pasts in order to reanimate and rewrite that past via a variety of imagined potentialities.  I use a self-reflective analysis of the trajectory of truth-telling in my own writing over time and then turn to examine the work of JG Ballard, Virginia Woolf, Katherine Mansfield, Jack Kerouac, and Louisa May Alcott using the revelations in their life writings to produce alternative readings of their fictions. By doing so, I will propose a practical tool for examining that most elusive textual artefact: the writer’s imagination. While the life writing of these writers reveal a single, nominalist, reading of the facts of their lives, that is, their novels demonstrate the power of fiction to unfold hidden potentialities, and further, multiplying facets of truth around those facts. I hope to demonstrate, moreover, the usefulness of the practice-based insights that life writing practitioners can bring to textual analysis as I examine the process of writing autobiographically-based fiction from the inside out.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jensen, Meg"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":2798632,"ep:Repository":58,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Introduction: life writing and critical practice","bibo:abstract":"Contemporary critical practice is becoming increasingly self-reflective, with first person commentary and subjective musings appearing in academic texts produced across disciplines. On the other hand, as the number of writing practitioners in the academy mounts, their works reflect a growing awareness of, and engagement with, the critical and theoretical debates that surround creative practice. Nowhere is this interchange between theory and practice more prevalent, however, than in the discipline of life writing, a field concerned with the forces at work on the borderland between the self or subject and the performance of that self in communicable form. Yet the two groups, life writing critics and life writing creatives, often remain mutually suspicious and their relationship under-theorised. This Special Cluster of Literature Compass brings together scholarly readings, both critical and creative in form, which interrogate the place of life writing in critical practice. These essays were developed through discussions and debates at the 7th Biennial International Auto/Biographical Association Conference at University of Sussex in June 2010.  IABA has led the professionalization of life writing as a field of literary critical debate and is increasingly being used as a forum for life writers as well. In this Special Cluster, leading figures in the field, both critics and practitioners, begin a dialogue on the developing phenomenon of creative/critical interface in life writing, and make suggestions for new pathways for the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jensen, Meg","Jolly, Margaretta"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Anti-doping messages designed to dissuade athletes from using PEDs have been typically based on moralising sport competition and/or employing scare campaigns with focus on the negative consequences. Campaigns offering comparable and acceptable alternatives are nonexistent, nor are athletes helped in finding these for themselves. It is timely that social marketing strategies for anti-doping prevention and intervention incorporate media messages that complement the existing approaches by promoting comparable and acceptable alternatives to doping. To facilitate this process, the aim of this study was to ascertain whether a single exposure knowledge-based information intervention led to increased knowledge and subsequently result in changes in beliefs and automatic associations regarding performance enhancements. METHODS: In a repeated measure design, 115 male recreational gym users were recruited and provided with a brief information pamphlet on nitrite/nitrate and erythropoietin as a comparison. Measures of knowledge, beliefs and automatic associations were taken before and after the intervention with at least 24 hours between the two assessments. The psychological tests included explicit measures of beliefs and cognitive attitudes toward FF and PED using a self-reported questionnaire and computerised assessments of automatic associations using the modified and shortened version of the Implicit Association Test. RESULTS: The information based intervention significantly increased knowledge (p \u003c 0.001), changed explicit beliefs in specific FF (p \u003c 0.001) and shifted the automatic association of FF with health to performance (p \u003c 0.001). Explicitly expressed beliefs and automatic associations appear to be independent. CONCLUSION: Evidence was found that even a single exposure to a persuasive positive message can lead to belief change and can create new or alter existing associations - but only in the specific domain. Interventions to change outcome expectations in a positive way could be a rewarding avenue for anti-doping. Effective social marketing campaigns for drug free sport should follow appropriate market segmentation and use targeted messages via promoting the natural form as opposed to the purified form of the main active ingredient.","bibo:AuthorList":["James, Ricky","Naughton, Declan P","Petroczi, Andrea"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1539442,"sim:weight":0.440546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90134,"sim:weight":0.430054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91239,"sim:weight":0.428513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90262,"sim:weight":0.427172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90504,"sim:weight":0.375194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.221922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13965,"sim:weight":0.219997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340178,"sim:weight":0.184155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.175001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.146407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Caralluma species are natural sources of a wide variety of pregnane glycosides. The aim of the study was to isolate, using an activity-guided fractionation approach, novel pregnane glycosides for testing on breast cancer and other tumour lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of crude extracts, specific organic fractions and isolated compounds from Caralluma tuberculata was tested on the growth and viability of MCF-7 estrogen-dependent, and MDA-MB-468 estrogen-independent breast cancer cells, Caco-2 human colonic cells, HUVECs and U937 cells. Neutral red uptake and MTT assays were used. Apoptosis was detected by Western blot of poly-(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) as were other markers of nuclear fragmentation (DNA ladder assay, staining of cells with nuclear dye DAPI). The involvement of caspases was investigated using the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. RESULTS: The ethyl acetate fraction of Caralluma tuberculata was found to be the most potent anti-proliferative fraction against all three cancer cell lines. Two novel steroidal glycosides were isolated from the active fraction after a series of chromatographic experiments. The structure of the isolated compounds was elucidated solely based on 2D-NMR (HMBC, HETCOR, DQF-COSY) and MS spectral analysis as compound 1: 12-O-benzoyl-20-O-acetyl-3β,12β,14β,20β-tetrahydroxy-pregnan-3-ylO-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-3-methoxy-β-d-ribopyranoside, and as compound 2: 7-O-acetyl-12-O-benzoyl-3β,7β,12β,14β-tetrahydroxy-17β-(3-methylbutyl-O-acetyl-1-yl)-androstan-3-ylO-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-6-deoxy-β-d-allopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-d-cymaropyranosyl-(1→4)-β-d-cymapyranosyl-(1→4)-β-d-cymaropyranoside. Compound 1 (pregnane glycoside) and compound 2 (androstan glycoside) induced apoptosis at \u003c25μM after 48h as assessed by cell shrinkage, PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation, and reversal with the caspase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Two novel steroid glycosides isolated from Caralluma tuberculata possess moderate, micromolar cytotoxic activity on breast cancer and other cells in vitro, which may indicate a source of activity in vivo of interest to future drug design.","bibo:AuthorList":["Waheed, Abdul","Barker, James","Barton, Stephen J.","Khan, Gul-Majid","Najm-Us-Saqib, Qazi","Hussain, Manzoor","Ahmed, Sabbir","Owen, Caroline","Carew, Mark A."],"dc:date":"2011-10-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5844390,"sim:weight":0.268393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5847899,"sim:weight":0.262477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848016,"sim:weight":0.219469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340567,"sim:weight":0.207985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5840925,"sim:weight":0.204987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5840926,"sim:weight":0.181917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84807,"sim:weight":0.145106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23283,"sim:weight":0.139533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.134913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929813,"sim:weight":0.118233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.112709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Measuring well-being in minority groups is complex and challenging. Scales are available that have been validated in specific parts of the population, such as older people. However, validation among combinations of minority groups, such as older adults of ethnic minority backgrounds, is lacking. \r\n\r\nFindings: \r\n\r\nWe pooled data from two surveys of older adults in Great Britain: one conducted among White British people, and one among four ethnic minority groups. Quality of life was measured by the Older People\u0027s Quality of Life (OPQOL); Control, Autonomy, Self-realisation, Pleasure (CASP-19); and World Health Organization Quality of Life scale for older people (WHOQOL-old). We found differences, some significant, between groups in terms of self-reported importance of various aspects of quality of life. A regression model of each total quality of life scale revealed greater unexplained variability in the White British group than the others. Principal components analysis within each ethnic group\u0027s data showed considerable differences in the correlation structures.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nThere are differences between ethnic groups that are consistent across the three scales and are not explained by a battery of predictor variables. If scales such as these are used to compare quality of life between ethnic groups, or equivalently between geographical regions, the different results in each group are liable to bias any comparison which could lead to inequitable policy decisions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Grant, Robert L","Bowling, Ann"],"dc:date":"2011-12-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.326683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.305944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91577,"sim:weight":0.290453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85735,"sim:weight":0.279671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91560,"sim:weight":0.261144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91570,"sim:weight":0.253393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91593,"sim:weight":0.247083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91562,"sim:weight":0.208728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.189638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108251,"sim:weight":0.170348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316090,"sim:weight":0.163742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Legislation for nurses and other professionals allied to medicine to prescribe exists in a minority of countries, with more considering introducing legislation. Although there is variation in the range of medicines permitted to be prescribed, questions remain as to the contribution prescribing by nurses and professionals allied to medicine makes to the care of patients in primary care and what is the evidence on which clinicians, commissioners of services and policy makers can consider this innovation.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nAn integrative review of literature on non-medical prescribing in primary care was undertaken guided by dimensions of health care quality: effectiveness, acceptability, efficiency and access.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\n19 papers of 17 empirical studies were identified which provided evidence of patient outcome of non medical prescribing in primary care settings. The majority were undertaken in the UK with only one each from the USA, Canada, Botswana and Zimbabwe. Only two studies investigated clinical outcomes of non-medical prescribing. Seven papers reported on qualitative designs and four of these had fewer than ten participants. Most studies reported that non medical prescribing was widely accepted and viewed positively by patients and professionals.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nPrimary health care is the setting where timely access to safe and appropriate medicines is most critical for the well-being of any population. The gradual growth over time of legislative authority and in the numbers of non-medical prescribers, particularly nurses, in some countries suggests that the acceptability of non-medical prescribing is based on the perceived value to the health care system as a whole. Our review suggests that there are substantial gaps in the knowledge base to help evidence based policy making in this arena. We suggest that future studies of non-medical prescribing in primary care focus on the broad range of patient and health service outcomes and include economic dimensions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bhanbhro, Sadiq","Drennan, Vari M","Grant, Robert","Harris, Ruth"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.471352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.381483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.318913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.315404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.305667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.301394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.289473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.244647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.240781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.239458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.223256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Rather than estimating fixed effects for specific clusters of data, \"predictions\" can be made as the mode or mean of posterior distributions that arise as the product of the random effect (an empirical Bayes prior) and the likelihood function conditional on cluster membership.\r\n\r\nAnalyses and data: This presentation will explore the experiences and lessons learned in using the bootstrap for inference on random-effects predictors following logistic regression models conducted through both xtmelogit and gllamm. In the United Kingdom, 203 hospitals were compared on the quality of care received by 10,617 stroke patients through multilevel logistic regression models.\r\n\r\nResults and considerations: Multilevel modeling and prediction are both computer-intensive, and so bootstrapping them is especially time-consuming. Examples from do-files with some helpful approaches will be shown. A small proportion of modal best linear unbiased predictors contained errors, possibly arising from the prediction algorithm. Various bootstrap confidence intervals exhibited problems such as excluding the point prediction and degeneracy. Methods for tracing the source will be presented.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Bootstrapping provides flexible but time-consuming inference for individual clusters’ predictions.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the overall QOL and of the HRQOL to predict several adverse health outcomes at a one-year follow-up in an older outpatient population living in the community.\r\n\r\nMETHODS:\r\n\r\nWe carried out a prospective cohort study on 210 community-dwelling outpatients aged 65+ (mean age 81.2 yrs) consecutively referred to a geriatric clinic in Milan, Italy. At baseline participants underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment including evaluation of overall QOL and HRQOL by means of the Older People\u0027s Quality of Life (OPQOL) questionnaire. At a one-year follow-up, between June and December 2010, we investigated nursing home placement and death in all 210 participants as well as any fall, any admission to the emergency department (ED), any hospitalisation and greater functional dependence among the subset of subjects still living at home.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nOne year after the visit 187 subjects were still living at home (89%) while 7 had been placed in a nursing home (3.3%) and 16 had died (7.7%). At multiple logistic regression analyses the lowest score-based quartile of the OPQOL total score at baseline was independently associated with a greater risk of any fall and any ED admission. Also, the lowest score-based quartile of the health-related OPQOL sub-score was associated with a greater risk of any fall as well as of nursing home placement (odds ratio [OR] 10.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-80.54, P \u003d 0.030) and death (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.06-16.81, P \u003d 0.041). The correlation with the latter two health outcomes was found after correction for age, sex, education, income, living conditions, comorbidity, disability and the frailty syndrome.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n\r\nIn an older outpatient population in Italy the OPQOL total score and its health-related sub-score were independent predictors of several adverse health outcomes at one year. Notably, poor HRQOL predicted both nursing home placement and death even after correction for the frailty syndrome. These findings support and enhance the prognostic relevance of QOL measures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bilotta, Claudio","Bowling, Ann","Nicolini, Paola","Case, Alessandra","Pina, Gloria","Rossi, Silvia V","Vergani, Carlo"],"dc:date":"2011-09-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91570,"sim:weight":0.561606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91593,"sim:weight":0.339994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.231767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.229661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25874,"sim:weight":0.224039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8747712,"sim:weight":0.220323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.210439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.207848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.187428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.171561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.137238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

With the advent of modern molecular and genomic approaches deeper insights have been attained not only into the divergence and speciation of these worms, but also into the historic movement of these parasites from Asia into Africa, via migration and dispersal of definitive and snail intermediate hosts. This movement was subsequently followed by a radiation of Schistosoma species giving rise to the S. mansoni and S. haematobium groups, as well as the S. indicum group that reinvaded Asia. Each of these major evolutionary events has been marked by distinct changes in genomic structure evident in differences in mitochondrial gene order and nuclear chromosomal architecture between the species associated with Asia and Africa. Data from DNA sequencing, comparative molecular genomics and karyotyping are indicative of major constitutional genomic events which would have become fixed in the ancestral populations of these worms. Here we examine how modern genomic techniques may give a more in depth understanding of the evolution of schistosomes and highlight the complexity of speciation and divergence in this group.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lawton, Scott P.","Hirai, Hirohisa","Ironside, Joe E.","Johnston, David A.","Rollinson, David"],"dc:date":"2011-07-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86996,"sim:weight":0.272767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397262,"sim:weight":0.253416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32132,"sim:weight":0.182939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.179796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.179796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.177799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.17218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85915,"sim:weight":0.148933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26936,"sim:weight":0.148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108527,"sim:weight":0.135651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.13243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":315591,"sim:weight":0.131929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316331,"sim:weight":0.114069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this paper was to develop a method for the analysis of two recreational drugs, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ([delta](9)-THC) and cocaine in hair samples using GC-MS, without prior derivatisation, thus allowing the sample to be reanalysed in its original form. An enzymatic digestion technique was also developed. Ten hair samples, that were known positive for either [delta](9)-THC and/or cocaine, were enzymatically digested, extracted, and then analysed by GC-MS. All samples measured contained [delta](9)-THC and one sample contained cocaine. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 0.02 ng/mg and 0.05 ng/mg, respectively, for cocaine and 0.015 ng/mg and 0.02 ng/mg, respectively, for [delta](9)-THC. The wide detection window, ease of direct analysis by GC-MS, lower detection limits of underivatised samples, and the stability of drugs using this technique may offer an improved method of analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Breidi, Salah Eddine","Barker, James","Petroczi, Andrea","Naughton, Declan"],"dc:date":"2012-01-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It also looked at whether fear beliefs acquired in this way could be effectively unlearned through counterconditioning.\r\nThe children (N \u003d 60), aged 6 to 10 years, were presented with images of novel animals, paired with counterbalanced images of negative or positive facial expressions, posed by their mothers or strangers, or left unpaired (control). Fear-related beliefs were assessed before and after the vicarious learning task and again after the counterconditioning\r\ntask by means of a self-report questionnaire and a behaviour task. In the behaviour task the children\u0027s avoidance feelings for the animals was assessed by where they placed a figure that represented themselves on a board (the \u0027nature reserve\u0027) relative to the animals. The results showed that the children demonstrated increased fear beliefs and avoidance of the animals following negative expressions from their mothers or strangers. Conversely, the children\u0027s fear beliefs decreased when paired with happy expressions. The results post the counter-conditioning (unlearning) showed that where fear beliefs had previously been shown to have increased by being paired with scared faces, they decreased when subsequently paired with happy faces. Similarly, where fear beliefs had previously been shown to have decreased by being paired with happy faces, they showed an increase in this condition when subsequently paired with scared faces. There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of the vicarious information where the source was the mother as compared with a stranger.

Thus, the aim of this paper was to investigate this activity following cooking and in vitro digestion of the common culinary herbs, rosemary, sage, and thyme, and the relationship between their anti-inflammatory activity, polyphenol content, and antioxidant capacity. The anti-inflammatory activity of uncooked (U), cooked (C), cooked and in vitro digested (C\u0026D), and standardised (STD, 30 mg/mL) culinary herbs was assessed by measuring their effect on interleukin 8 (IL-8) release from stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and Caco-2 cells. The trolox equivalent capacity (TEAC) and estimated total phenolic content of the herbs were also determined. There was a significant decrease in IL-8 release from PBLs stimulated with H(2)O(2) incubated with (U), (C), (C\u0026D), and (STD) herbs and from Caco-2 cells stimulated with TNFα incubated with (C\u0026D) and (STD) herbs. PBLs pre-incubated with (C\u0026D) herbs prior to stimulation (H(2)O(2) or TNFα) caused a significant inhibition in IL-8 release.

The aim of this study was to extend previous reports on network analysis relating to food notifications by including an optional filter by type of notification and in cases of contamination, by type of contaminant in the notified foodstuff.\r\n\r\nMethodology/Principal Findings\r\nA filter function has been applied to enable processing of selected notifications by contaminant or type of notification to i) capture complexity, ii) analyze trends, and iii) identify patterns of reporting activities between countries. The program rapidly assesses nations\u0027 roles as transgressor and/or detector for each category of contaminant and for the key class of border rejection. In the open access demonstration version, the majority of notifications in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed were categorized by contaminant type as mycotoxin (50.4%), heavy metals (10.9%) or bacteria (20.3%). Examples are given demonstrating how network analytical approaches complement, and in some cases supersede, descriptive statistics such as frequency counts, which may give limited or potentially misleading information. One key feature is that network analysis takes the relationship between transgressor and detector countries, along with number of reports and impact simultaneously into consideration. Furhermore, the indices that compliment the network maps and reflect each country\u0027s transgressor and detector activities allow comparisons to be made between (transgressing vs. detecting) as well as within (e.g. transgressing) activities.\r\n\r\nConclusions/significance\r\nThis further development of the network analysis approach to food safety contributes to a better understanding of the complexity of the effort ensuring food is safe for consumption in the European Union. The unique patterns of the interplay between detectors and transgressors, instantly revealed by our approach, could supplement the intelligence gathered by regulatory authorities and inform risk based sampling protocols.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nepusz, Tamas","Petroczi, Andrea","Naughton, Declan"],"dc:date":"2012-04-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90766,"sim:weight":0.421599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89914,"sim:weight":0.392048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.219336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108424,"sim:weight":0.205981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.194708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.192524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.189772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.18506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.181077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.18045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.130973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.0952295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In vitro plant propagation and enhanced metabolite production of active metabolites through biotechnological approaches has gained attention in recent years.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nPresent study reveals that 6-benzyladenine (BA) either alone or in combination with 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) supplemented in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium at different concentrations produced good quality callus from leaf explants of C. asiatica. The calli produced on different plant growth regulators at different concentrations were mostly embryogenic and green. Highest shoot regeneration efficiency; 10 shoots per callus explant, from non-embryogenic callus was observed on 4.42 μM BA with 5.37 μM NAA. Best rooting response was observed at 5.37 and 10.74 μM NAA with 20 average number of roots per explant. Calli and regenerated plants extracts inhibited bacterial growth with mean zone of inhibition 9-13 mm diameter when tested against six bacterial strains using agar well diffusion method. Agar tube dilution method for antifungal assay showed 3.2-76% growth inhibition of Mucor species, Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium moliniformes.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n\r\nThe present investigation reveals that non-embryogenic callus can be turned into embryos and plantlets if cultured on appropriate medium. Furthermore, callus from leaf explant of C. asiatica can be a good source for production of antimicrobial compounds through bioreactor.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bibi, Yamin","Zia, Muhammad","Nisa, Sobia","Habib, Darima","Waheed, Abdul","Chaudhary, Fayyaz M"],"dc:date":"2011-10-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5699914,"sim:weight":0.506065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5846927,"sim:weight":0.413113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":655852,"sim:weight":0.384437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5699920,"sim:weight":0.348011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5846919,"sim:weight":0.327169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":654478,"sim:weight":0.313343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":663485,"sim:weight":0.259149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The reasonable adjustments duty has become statutory since 2007 and plethora of supportive material has been available to support settings on the implementation of what could be seen as a far more social orientated model of disability.  \r\n\r\nThis poster will communicate the findings of a qualitative, small-scale project under the umbrella of ICCIP (Institute for Child Centred Interprofessional Practice, Kingston University) that investigates those  processes in action by exploring discourses and practices relating to ‘reasonable adjustments’ as used and understood by different stakeholders, front line workers (teachers, TAs), multi-agency service providers, school management teams, parents and the children themselves -for whom the adjustments have taken place.  Shared values, beliefs and preparedness for inclusion verse exclusion will be explored through the above stakeholders’ voices.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nMethod\r\n\r\nThe study is in line with a qualitative interpretative research paradigm and aims a) to identify issues that will frame the research agenda, b) to explore in-depth the experiences of different stakeholders of reasonable adjustments in an inter-professional context, c) to gain a better understanding of the personal/social outcomes of these adjustments through the voice of the child. In the context of this project three primary school children from one-form entry inner-city primary school in London were selected. Each of the selected children has been part of the school’s inclusion register for an identified additional educational need or disability and their inclusion has required some kind of reasonable adjustment. One important aspect of the methodology of this project is the focus on service-user involvement and participation. Not only is one of the researchers also a service-user, but participants are invited to influence the direction of research in this and future projects, in line with the many advantages of this process outlined in the recent INVOLVE report (2009).\r\n\r\nExpected Outcomes\r\n\r\nThe voices and experiences of stakeholders will inform a discussion about the need perhaps for a response along the lines of a ‘social pedagogy’ found in large parts of Western Europe and Scandinavia were education would be something much more than schools. It is based on a fundamentally holistic concept of children and adults in which the teachers concentrate on teaching but not in isolation (Whitney, 2007). Following this project, there is also scope for creating a network of stakeholders from different settings/boroughs on issues of inter-professional practice to promote positive and innovative examples of successful reasonable adjustments and their sustainability within a social model of disability. Possibilities for parent participation and possible parent forums will be explored, in line with recent government guidelines (Davies, 2010).","bibo:AuthorList":["Paliokosta, Panagiota","Kindness, Leonie"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.385803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.380984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.379896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316190,"sim:weight":0.369722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.36023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.322604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.30601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1541037,"sim:weight":0.292262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
