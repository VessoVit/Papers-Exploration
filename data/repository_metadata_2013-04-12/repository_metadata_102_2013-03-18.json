Among them are an ageing population and a rising\r\nincidence of chronic health conditions. This situation requires a radical re-examination of how people manage their health and their healthcare in ways that challenge the relationship between people and healthcare services. Combining this observation with the opportunities afforded by pervasive information and communication technologies, we argue that design research should reach beyond simply locating devices and services to offer healthcare ‘in the home’ and should examine this broader agenda. Rather than focussing design discourse on the specifics of one location, we should adopt a holistic view, beginning from\r\npeople’s lived experience. In this position paper we describe the User-Centred Healthcare Design (UCHD) project, a 5-year collaboration between universities and NHS Trusts in South Yorkshire, UK. We suggest that new models of healthcare that re-define the institutional and social context of care are required if we are to meet the challenge\r\nof chronic illness. We describe our progress to date on the UCHD project, our commitment to placing patient experience at the centre of design, and our initial experiences of using an experience-based co-design method to improve outpatient services in a Sheffield hospital.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dearden, Andy","Wright, Peter","Bowen, Simon","Rahman, Fazilatur","Cobb, Mark","Wolstenholme, Dan"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.532922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.410491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.402753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.40144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.398151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.396868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.391812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3200,"sim:weight":0.374019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3198,"sim:weight":0.371563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.369221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.36911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":34306,"sim:weight":0.362588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.329459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.322277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.316547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.310456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.308521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5941,"sim:weight":0.308374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.301847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.297857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We extend LBM to recover hydrodynamics of multi-component immiscible fluids, whilst retaining a completely local, explicit and simple algorithm. Hence, no computationally expensive lattice gradients, interaction potentials or curvatures, that use information from neighbouring lattice sites, need be calculated, which makes the method highly scalable and suitable for high performance parallel computing. The method is analytic and is shown to recover correct continuum hydrodynamic equations of motion and interfacial boundary conditions. This LBM may be further extended to situations containing a high number (O(100)) of individually immiscible drops. We make comparisons of the emergent non-Newtonian behaviour with a power-law fluid model. We anticipate our method will have a range applications in engineering, industrial and biological sciences.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spencer, Timothy","Halliday, Ian","Care, Chris"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Bernaschi, S Melchionna, S Succi, M Fyta, E Kaxiras and J K Sircar.

Between 1998 and 2010, 39 NDC Partnerships were charged with improving conditions in relation to six outcomes within deprived neighbourhoods, each accommodating around 9,800 people. Data point to only modest change, much of which reflected improving attitudes towards the area and the environment. There are problems in identifying positive people-based outcomes because relatively few individuals benefit from relevant initiatives. Few positive benefits leak out of NDC areas. Transformational change was always unlikely bearing in mind the limited nature of additional resources, and because only a minority of individuals directly engage with NDC projects. This evidence supports perspectives of ABIs rooted in \u0027local-managerialism\u0027.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lawless, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Atkinson and G Moon.

Using patterns involving alternating stripes of homeotropic-favoring and homogeneous-favoring substrates, we investigate the influence of the relative stripe width and the film thickness. From this, we show that the polar anchoring angle can be varied continuously from planar to homeotropic by appropriate tuning of these parameters. For very thin films with equal stripe widths, we observe orientational bridging, the surface patterning being written in domains which traverse the nematic film. This dual bridging- domain arrangement breaks down with increase in film thickness, however, being replaced by a single tilted monodomain. Strong azimuthal anchoring in the plane of the stripe boundaries is observed for all systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anquetil-Deck, Candy","Cleaver, Doug"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100257,"sim:weight":0.679276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100236,"sim:weight":0.518727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100242,"sim:weight":0.470687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100255,"sim:weight":0.446118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45656,"sim:weight":0.386156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10911,"sim:weight":0.297418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269957,"sim:weight":0.285927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100230,"sim:weight":0.242443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98482,"sim:weight":0.23593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.22587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.224481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271189,"sim:weight":0.224391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100226,"sim:weight":0.216268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271098,"sim:weight":0.208847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.207743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.2064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496580,"sim:weight":0.204816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12333,"sim:weight":0.204633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100258,"sim:weight":0.204053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100247,"sim:weight":0.195356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The relative benefits of screening in women over 70 are reduced but women up to age 80 may still benefit. In the UK the National Health Service provides screening by self referral to women \u003e70. This research has investigated health care professionals\u0027 (HCPs\u0027) preferences for extending screening to older women and factors they consider when advising about screening.\r\n\r\nMaterials and methods\r\nUK HCPs for breast or elderly care were recruited.

A sample of respondents were also interviewed to give added insight.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nQuestionnaires were distributed to 488 HCPs and 139 replies received, (29%). A total of 26 professionals were also interviewed. Most felt the current system of self referral was under-utilized due to poor user awareness. Predicted life expectancy, co-morbidity and patient preference were viewed as important factors influencing screening recommendation. Chronological age was thought less important. The present system was thought flawed, but there was little enthusiasm for extending screening due to perceived risks and reduced cost efficacy. Some form of selectivity for fitter women was advocated.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThere was acceptance that fitter older women may benefit from screening whilst the less fit may be harmed suggesting that some form of selective invitation would be preferable to the present system but would be practically difficult and costly to administer. The present system of self referral was felt to be inadequate due to low levels of awareness and uptake.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walters, Stephen","Winslow, Michelle","Collins, Karen","Robinson, Thompson","Green, Tracy","Madan, Jason","Reed, Malcolm W R","Wyld, Lynda"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100417,"sim:weight":0.817294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.45809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17869,"sim:weight":0.415321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103590,"sim:weight":0.353233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.321852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336599,"sim:weight":0.301282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.262536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.257713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336414,"sim:weight":0.248661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57403,"sim:weight":0.248423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335443,"sim:weight":0.245574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.243057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.232128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.213339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.212634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.212045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177050,"sim:weight":0.209539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17910,"sim:weight":0.201276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.190084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.158857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first two phases of the study focussed on entry into the NQT year and the NQT\r\nyear itself; the third phase looked at the second year of teaching. This paper utilises data from this\r\nthird phase - particularly case study interviews with teachers and SLT members - to consider the\r\nissues of ECTs\u0027 careers and career development. The topic is of particular interest, since whilst the\r\npicture in terms of teacher supply and retention in the profession overall is much improved in recent\r\nyears (for example, proportions of unfilled vacancies have declined according to DCSF data, and\r\nSmithers and Robinson (2003, 2004, 2005) found that the retention issue tailed off and stabilised over\r\nthe period of their studies), it is clear that schools vary widely in their ability to recruit and retain staff\r\nin their early careers. This paper aims to explore these variations in different contexts and school\r\ncultures, to illuminate these differences.\r\n\r\nResearch Questions\r\nThis focus of this paper is to examine how SLT members in different contexts and cultures manage,\r\nand view, career development for ECTs in their schools and to compare these views with those of\r\nECTs in the same schools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coldwell, Michael","Maxwell , Brownwen","Mccaig, Colin"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Y Baruch.

A conceptual framework is developed by extending Billett’s (International Journal of Educational Research 47:232–240, 2008) conceptualisation of workplace learning, as a relationally interdependent process between the opportunities workplaces afford for activities and interactions and how individuals engage with these, to a third base of participation, the affordances of the initial teacher education course. Hager and Hodkinson’s (British Educational Research Journal 35:619–638, 2009) metaphor of ‘learning as becoming’ is used to conceptualise the ways trainees reconstruct learning in a continuous transactional process of boundary crossing between course and workplace. The findings of six longitudinal case studies of trainees’ development, and evidence from other studies, illustrate the complex interrelationships between LSS workplace affordances, course affordances and trainee characteristics and the ways in which trainees reconstruct learning in each setting. The experience of teaching and interacting with learners, interactions with colleagues, and access to workplace resources and training are important workplace affordances for learning. However, some trainees have limited access to these affordances. Teaching observations, course activities and experiences as a learner are significant course affordances. Trainees’ beliefs, prior experiences and dispositions vary and significantly influence their engagement with course and workplace affordances. It is proposed that better integration of course and workplace learning through guided participation in an intentional workplace curriculum and attention to the ways trainees choose to engage with this, together with the use of practical theorising has the potential to improve trainee learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maxwell, Bronwen"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Bathmaker and J Avis.

Conceptions become more multi-dimensional and increasingly link teaching and learning whilst initial concern with the practicalities of teaching is followed by recognition of learners’ needs. Next, greater emphasis is placed on learner autonomy and catering for individuals’ needs and finally assessment and evaluation is used systematically to shape practice. The continua offer an understanding of the subtleties and complexities of trainee development allowing\r\nfor different starting and end points and accommodating varied work contexts.

The reforms are underpinned by objectivist epistemological assumptions which are incompatible with socio-cultural theories of professional knowledge, and ignore the diverse teaching roles and contexts in the sector and wider systemic issues. A qualitative scoping study found that LSS in-service trainee teachers drew on three types of knowledge resources, or clusters of ‘rules’ for practice, in their teaching: these were related to their subject/vocational area, generic teaching and learning processes and specific learners and groups. Trainees generated knowledge resources through participation in their workplace, ITE course and other social contexts, and from embedded and encoded workplace knowledge. Trainees’ beliefs, values and prior experiences were both a knowledge resource and influenced their engagement with knowledge generation activities. It is argued that using a knowledge resources perspective, which recognises how trainees generate knowledge and seeks to bridge gaps in their access to knowledge resources, would\r\nbe more effective in supporting trainees’ development than the current reforms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maxwell, Bronwen"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Avis and A-M Bathmaker.

The first test was instrumental to identify weaknesses in both functionalities and interface; the second was run to determine if query translation should be shown or not; the final was a global assessment and focused on user satisfaction criteria.

A holistic perspective has been adopted involving writers, readers and publishers alike.\r\n\r\nDesign/methodology/approach – The research uses a qualitative approach and combines interviews and direct observations. In in-depth interviews 13 participants (four writers, four publishers, three readers and two on-line readers) were questioned for their opinions on issues related to writing, publishing and reading digital fiction. The three readers were also observed while interacting, for the first time, with three digital stories.\r\n\r\nFindings – Results show that the area is still unsettled though much excitement surrounds experimentations and freedom of publishing online. Readers seem uneasy with the role of co-creators that writers want to assign them and prefer linear stories to more deconstructed ones. Writers like to experiment and combine multiple media and readers like to interact with multimedia stories; this seems to open interesting perspectives over interactive narrative. Publishers are not yet involved in digital writing and this is seen simultaneously as a blessing (unfiltering of innovative ideas) and a curse (lack of economical support, lack of quality selection). Despite disagreement and ambiguity all interviewees agree that digital fiction will come, likely prompted by new reading technology.\r\n\r\nOriginality/value – This paper is the first attempt to understand the phenomena of digital writing taking into consideration the perspectives of writers, readers and publishers simultaneously and comparing their different views.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petrelli, Daniela","Wright, Hazel"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1352215,"sim:weight":0.618587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45883,"sim:weight":0.437904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.404552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.394066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.373809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313555,"sim:weight":0.361341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929837,"sim:weight":0.349809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381997,"sim:weight":0.347071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.332672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.328458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46605,"sim:weight":0.315011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88939,"sim:weight":0.294449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.290831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931334,"sim:weight":0.289232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.288374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.287576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47210,"sim:weight":0.28582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.285214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2916,"sim:weight":0.261417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46639,"sim:weight":0.257599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Multiple methods were employed to investigate the effectiveness of technology and the modality of user access. Automatic keyframe extraction was tested on the visual content while the audio stream was used for automatic classification of speech and music clips. The user access (search vs browse) was assessed in a controlled user evaluation. A focus group and a survey provided insight on the actual use of the analogue archive. The results of these multiple studies were then compared and integrated (triangulation).\r\n\r\nFindings – The amateur material challenged automatic techniques for video and audio indexing, thus suggesting that the technology must be tested against the material before deciding on a digitisation strategy. Two user interaction modalities, browsing vs searching, were tested in a user evaluation. Results show users preferred searching, but browsing becomes essential when the search engine fails in matching query and indexed words. Browsing was also valued for serendipitous discovery; however the organisation of the archive was judged cryptic and therefore of limited use. This indicates that the categorisation of an online archive should be thought of in terms of users who might not understand the current classification. The focus group and the survey showed clearly the advantage of online access even when the quality of the video surrogate is poor. The evidence gathered suggests that the creation of a digital version of a video archive requires a rethinking of the collection in terms of the new medium: a new archive should be specially designed to exploit the potential that the digital medium offers. Similarly, users\u0027 needs have to be considered before designing the digital library interface, as needs are likely to be different from those imagined.\r\n\r\nOriginality/value – This paper is the first attempt to understand the advantages offered and limitations held by video retrieval technology for small video archives like those often found in special collections.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petrelli, Daniela","Auld, Dan"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Assfalg, M Bertini, C Colombo, Del Bimbo and A.

Instead of focusing on such technical possibilities, here we investigate the way people compose long-term mnemonic representations of their lives. We asked 10 families to create a time capsule, a collection of objects used to trigger remembering in the distant future. Our results show that contrary to the lifelogging view, people are less interested in exhaustively digitally recording their past than in reconstructing it from carefully selected cues that are often physical objects. Time capsules were highly expressive and personal, many objects were made explicitly for inclusion, however with little object annotation. We use these findings to propose principles for designing technology that supports the active reconstruction of our future past.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petrelli, Daniela","Van den Hoven, Elise","Whittaker, Steve"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100573,"sim:weight":0.621959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51466,"sim:weight":0.619101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.513819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.4851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.483809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100566,"sim:weight":0.461052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100568,"sim:weight":0.440254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.430902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.427565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.422916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.416082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16699,"sim:weight":0.400215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44852,"sim:weight":0.376949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.37088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.368265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.365431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48270,"sim:weight":0.341437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.328649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44804,"sim:weight":0.325968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106765,"sim:weight":0.31911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To do this they need to acquire a threshold level of intellectual capital so that they are considered sufficiently competent to gain employment.  This can therefore provide the industry with a solid foundation of the necessary support staff, capable of providing services to the local community supporting such educational initiatives.  This initiative can then release the more conventionally educated to work at the cutting edge of industry.  As a driver for wealth generation in India, the IT industry is remarkable.  It demands a wide spectrum of intellectual capital.  As diffusion of IT technology is predicted to pervade throughout the subcontinent, the demand for all levels of competence would seem to be buoyant. The training environment covered in this case study complements the traditional educational system and could furnish alternative career opportunities to certain sections of the community.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\nThis paper takes a strategic view throughout.

{"identifier":11062,"ep:Repository":102,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Sport and economic regeneration: a winning combination?","bibo:abstract":"In recent years, there has been a favourable shift in UK urban policy towards the use of sport as a tool for regenerating declining areas. Sporting infrastructure has been constructed in various British cities with a view to addressing the dual aims of sporting need and urban regeneration. However, evidence to support the notion that sport can underpin regeneration goals is highly variable. This paper will explore the growth of sport-related regeneration in the UK and examine the evidence base for this. In particular, it will focus on the economic literature and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of emerging evidence. It will suggest that with investment in sport likely to increase as a consequence of the London 2012 Olympic Games, there is a need to develop a greater understanding of the role of sport in the regeneration process, to maximize the potential benefits and to justify public expenditure on sport in the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, L."],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B H Archer.

The respiration region of interest (ROI) consisted of the skin area around the tip of the nose. The method was then used as part of a non-contact respiration rate monitoring that determined the skin temperature changes caused by respiration. The ROI was located by the first determining the relevant salient features of the human face physiology. These features were the warmest and coldest facial points. The tracking method was tested on thermal video images containing no head movements, small random and regular head movements. The method proved valuable for tracking the ROI in all these head movement types. It was also possible to use this tracking method to monitor respiration rate involving a number of head movement types. Currently, more investigations are underway to improve the tracking method so that it can track the ROI in cases larger head movements.","bibo:AuthorList":["AL-Khalidi, F.

Spoken relative clause sentences were accompanied by visual context pictures which fully (depicting the actions described within the relative clause) or partially (depicting several referents) met the pragmatic assumptions of relativisation.  Comprehension of the main and relative clauses of centre-embedded and right-branching structures was compared for each context. Pragmatically-appropriate contexts exerted a positive effect on relative clause comprehension, but children with higher memory spans demonstrated a further benefit for main clauses.  Comprehension for centre-embedded main clauses was found to be very poor, independently of either context or memory span.  The results suggest that children have access to adult-like linguistic processing mechanisms, and that sensitivity to extra-linguistic cues is evident in young children and develops as cognitive capacity increases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Weighall, Anna R.","Altmann, Gerry T.

The initiative characterises the unfairness of admissions as unequal opportunity for poorer parents to access good schools because they are less able to negotiate the admissions process. A major objective of Choice Advice is to enable more poor parents to gain access to popular and high performing secondary schools. The results of an evaluation in 15 Local Authorities are presented showing that Choice Advice provided a valuable service to some families but the proportion of poorer families helped was too small to make a significant impact on the numbers of poorer parents gaining access to popular schools. The characterisation of the problem is, we argue, flawed and, as a consequence, so is the way this policy was designed. Choice Advice is an example of a discursively complex initiative that is ambivalent in its effects. It provides a symbol of political will and is of real benefit to some parents, but it sustains a way of characterising the problem that plays a part in labelling poorer parents as deficient while making no significant impact on the unfairness of admissions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coldron, John","Cripps, Caroline","Shipton, Lucy","Stiell, Bernadette"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N Adnett and P Davies.

Often, the correspondence calculation forms part of a rigid registration algorithm, but accurate correspondences are especially important for elastic registration algorithms and for quantifying changes over time. In this paper, a new correspondence calculation algorithm, CSM (correspondence by sensitivity to movement), is described. A robust corresponding point is calculated by determining the sensitivity of a correspondence to movement of the point being matched. If the correspondence is reliable, a perturbation in the position of this point should not result in a large movement of the correspondence. A measure of reliability is also calculated. This correspondence calculation method is independent of the registration transformation and has been incorporated into both a 2D elastic registration algorithm for warping serial sections and a 3D rigid registration algorithm for registering pre and postoperative facial range scans. These applications use different methods for calculating the registration transformation and accurate rigid and elastic alignment of images has been achieved with the CSM method. It is expected that this method will be applicable to many different applications and that good results would be achieved if it were to be inserted into other methods for calculating a registration transformation from correspondences","bibo:AuthorList":["Guest, E.","Berry, E.","Baldock, R.

Currently Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) uses software, designed to reduce errors by drawing radiologists\u0027 attention to possible abnormalities by placing prompts on images. Alberdi et al examined the effects of CAD prompts on performance, comparing the negative effect of no prompt on a cancer case with prompts on a normal case. They showed that no prompt on a cancer case can have a detrimental effect on reader sensitivity and that the reader performs worse than if the reader was not using CAD. This became particularly apparent when difficult cases were being read. They suggested that the readers were using CAD as a decision making tool instead of a prompting aid. They conclude that \"incorrect CAD can have a detrimental effect on human decisions\" [2].

In this paper, we present findings from the Sacred Sites, Contested Rights/Rites\r\nProject: Contemporary Pagan Engagements with the Past, now in its sixth year. Having examined the diversity of Pagan representations of the past and engagements with monuments, we turn our attention here to calls for respect and reburial with regard to prehistoric remains and associated\r\nartefacts held by museums and archaeology departments in Britain. These British Pagans, Druids in particular, are claiming a say in how human remains and associated artefacts are excavated by archaeologists and\r\ncurated in museum and university collections. We identify Pagans as ‘new-indigenes’, in part due to their drawing on indigenous perspectives elsewhere in their discourse, and we problematise and theorise this discourse. There is no single Pagan voice on the issue. The Council of\r\nBritish Druid Orders’ press release (leaked October 2006) calling for the immediate ‘return’ and reburial of certain pagan remains is proactive in its approach, while Honouring the Ancient Dead (HAD), a British network organisation set up to ensure respect for ancient pagan human remains and\r\nrelated artefacts, has collaborated with the Museums Association in this conference bringing professionals and Pagans into dialogue to explore the ‘philosophy and practice’ surrounding ‘respect for ancient British human\r\nremains’. This dialogue, alongside instances of reburial already in action,reflects a diversity of Pagan voices as well as the ways in which heritage managers and museum professionals are reflexively addressing this issue.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wallis, Robert","Blain, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Barnatt.

This study formed part of a larger project, completed in 2009, which also included a systematic review of international research. The findings discussed in this paper are based on analyses of interviews with 51 service managers and questionnaire returns from 205 school nurses. Four themes are discussed. First, we found three main service permutations, in a context of very diverse and uneven implementation. Second, we identified factors within the school context that shaped and often constrained service provision; some of these also have implications for sex and relationships education (SRE). Third, we found contrasting approaches to the relationship between SRE input and sexual health provision. Fourth, we identified some specific barriers that need to be addressed in order to develop \u0027young people friendly\u0027 services in the school context. The relative autonomy available to school head teachers and governors can represent an obstacle to service provision - and inter-professional collaboration - in a climate where, in many schools, there is still considerable ambivalence about discussing \u0027sex\u0027 openly. In conclusion, we identify areas worthy of further research and development, in order to address some obstacles to sexual health service and SRE provision in schools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Formby, E.","Hirst, J.","Owen, J.","Hayter, M.","Stapleton, H."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Attwood.

An evidence synthesis was performed based on a systematic review of the quantitative evidence about service effectiveness, qualitative evidence about user and professional views and a mixed-methods synthesis. A proof-of-concept model for assessing cost-effectiveness was drawn up. \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003eResults: \u003c/b\u003eThree broad types of UK sexual health service provision were identified. Firstly, SBSHS staffed by school nurses, offering ‘minimal’ or ‘basic’ levels of service. Secondly, SBSHS and SLSHS staffed by a multiprofessional team, but not medical practitioners, offering ‘basic’ or ‘intermediate’ levels of service. Thirdly, SBSHS and SLSHS staffed by a multiprofessional team, including medical practitioners offering ‘intermediate’ or ‘comprehensive’ levels of service. The systematic review showed that SBSHS are not associated with higher rates of sexual activity among young people, nor with an earlier age of first intercourse. There was evidence to show positive effects in terms of reductions in births to teenage mothers, and in chlamydial infection rates among young men, although this evidence coming primarily from the USA. Therefore, the findings need to be tested in relation to UK-based services. Also evidence to suggest that broad-based, holistic service models, not restricted to sexual health, offer the strongest basis for protecting young people’s privacy and confidentiality, countering perceived stigmatisation, offering the most comprehensive range of products and services, and maximising service uptake. Findings from the mapping study also indicate that broad-based services, which include medical practitioner input within a multiprofessional team, meet the stated preferences of staff and of young people most clearly. Partnership-based developments of this kind also conform to the broad policy principles embodied in the Every Child Matters framework in the UK and allied policy initiatives. However, neither these service models nor narrower ones have been rigorously evaluated in terms of their impact on the key outcomes of conception rates and sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates, in the UK or in other countries. Therefore, appropriate data were not found to support cost-effectiveness modelling.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003eLimitations:\u003c/b\u003e Low response rate to the questionnaire. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were under-represented. Also, the distinction made in the questionnaire between ‘general health’ and ‘sexual health’ services did not prove robust. \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003eConclusions:\u003c/b\u003e There is no single, dominant service model in the UK. The systematic review demonstrated that the evidence base for these services remains limited and uneven, and draws largely on US studies. Qualitative research is needed to develop robust process and outcome indicators for the evaluation of SLSHS/SBSHS in the UK. These indicators could then be used both in local evaluations, and in large, longitudinal studies of service effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Future research should examine the impact of the differing types of services currently evolving in the UK, encompassing school-based and school-linked models, as well as models with and without medical practitioner involvement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Owen, J.","Carroll, C.","Cooke, J.","Formby, E.","Hayter, M.","Hirst, J.","Lloyd Jones, M.","Stapleton, H.","Stevenson, M.","Sutton, A."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(1951). of the Social Sciences","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"of the Social Sciences","dc:date":"1951","doi":"10.2307/1932747"},{"rawReferenceText":"(sexually transmit$ or STI or STD or pregnanc$ or conception$).tw.","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"(sexually transmit$ or STI or STD or pregnanc$ or conception$).tw."},{"rawReferenceText":"sexual$ or risk$) adj2 (activ$ or behav$)).tw.","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"sexual$ or risk$) adj2 (activ$ or behav$)).tw."},{"rawReferenceText":"(2008). limit 11 to yr\u003d“1985 -","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"limit 11 to yr\u003d“1985 -","dc:date":"2008"}],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.759264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65377,"sim:weight":0.751563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229632,"sim:weight":0.742203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47377,"sim:weight":0.696048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177062,"sim:weight":0.69249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447298,"sim:weight":0.68535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55751,"sim:weight":0.684049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1680,"sim:weight":0.682205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24852,"sim:weight":0.681722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57701,"sim:weight":0.678666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41404,"sim:weight":0.66609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.658508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.658508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93508,"sim:weight":0.65695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":600453,"sim:weight":0.654415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160536,"sim:weight":0.653743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56774,"sim:weight":0.642496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176989,"sim:weight":0.626861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160659,"sim:weight":0.617525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157548,"sim:weight":0.615693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It pursues the apparent contradictions in these claims by focussing on a specific pornographic text, the British downmarket softcore magazine, Fiesta, and locating it in relation to other forms of sexual and non-sexual representation. In considering the text’s relation to other ‘mass’ and ‘low’ texts, ‘bawdy’ and ‘carnivalesque’ sensibilities, it becomes possible to establish its particularly British and vulgar representation of sexuality which relies not only on its sexual content, but on a ‘dirty style’ in which notions of sexual propriety are self-consciously transgressed. The analysis of Fiesta plays particular attention to the role of women’s bodies and a mode of ‘dirty talk’ as key elements in its representation of sexuality which illuminate the rather abstract claims made about pornography’s structures of dominance and transgression.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Attwood, F."],"dc:date":"2002-02-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Issue.

Key to its success is that software designers collaborate with environment builders to provide the levels of cooperation and support required within an integrated agent–oriented community system. Agent-oriented Unified Modeling Language (AUML) is a practical approach to the analysis, design, implementation and management of such an agent-based system, whilst providing the power and expressiveness necessary to support the specification, design and organization of a health care service.  The background of an agent-based community care application to support the elderly is described.  Our approach to building agent–oriented software development solutions emphasizes the importance of AUML as a fundamental initial step in producing more general agent–based architectures. This approach aims to present an effective methodology for an agent software development process using a service oriented approach, by addressing the agent decomposition, abstraction, and organization characteristics, whilst reducing its complexity by exploiting AUML’s productivity potential.   \u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Beer, M.","Huang, W.","Hill, R."],"dc:date":"2003-07-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Coscia M Ancona.

This article describes the development and use of different types of online kiosk in contexts where users are on the move and away from fixed technologies. A case study of a major UK airport terminal is used to illustrate different types of kiosk applications. Comparisons are made with mobile phone technologies. Online kiosks have a niche in allowing access to information, services and e-commerce technologies for all potential consumers.

This comprises the design and implementation of a sophisticated Internet-based system through which courses can be managed, prepared and delivered online in an effective fashion, and where students can communicate both with the staff and their peers.  The aim is to support and facilitate the whole range of educational activities within a remote electronic environment.

Issues such as fear, loneliness, dependency, and physical decline may be difficult to observe or discuss in interviews. Pastiche scenarios and pastiche personae are techniques that employ characters to create a space for the discussion of new technological developments and as a means to explore user experience. This paper argues that the use of such characters can help to overcome restrictive notions of older people by disrupting designers\u0027 prior assumptions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this paper, we reflect on our experiences using pastiche techniques in two separate technology design projects that sought to address the needs of older people. In the first case pastiche scenarios were developed by the designers of the system and used as discussion documents with users. In the second case, pastiche personae were used by groups of users themselves to generate scenarios which were scribed for later use by the design team. We explore how the use of fictional characters and settings can  generate new ideas and undermine rhetorical devices within scenarios that attempt to fit characters to the technology, rather than vice versa. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo assist in future development of pastiche techniques in designing for older people, we provide an array of fictional older characters drawn from literary and popular culture.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Blythe, M.","Dearden, A.

It considers contemporary representations of the home, locating these in relation to changes in British primetime programming where a movement towards hybrid TV forms appears to rearticulate the mission to ‘inform, educate and entertain’ and to transform private matters into public spectacle. The paper examines the ways in which contemporary representations of the male domestic expert struggle to negotiate perceived boundaries between the ‘inside’ of private space and the ‘outside’ of the public sphere and between the categories of femininity and masculinity. It argues that in the homes and gardens series, Home Front, the figure of the designer provides a significant contemporary rearticulation of the male dandy, and aestheticism and camp become key strategies for the redefinition of the home and of masculinity as matters of lifestyle.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Attwood, F."],"dc:date":"2005-03-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B Benwell.

It suggests that  while all three approaches continue to be productive for the analysis of sexual representations, their usefulness is limited by a tendency towards essentialism. A discussion of the public controversy around an advert for Opium perfume in 2000 is used to argue that an attentiveness to the context of particular images, and to the variety of reactions they provoke, provides a useful way of developing the analysis of sexual representations and their contemporary significance.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Attwood, F."],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"John Berger.

Secondly, we argue that a critical perspective, explicitly foregrounding empowerment and emancipatory concerns,\r\nforms a basis for emphasising the practice of individuals,\r\ngroups and organsations , rather than purely focusing on\r\norganisational form in social action. We discuss this context of social action, identifying some relevant ICT-related challenges. We identify three themes that highlight factors that differentiate ICT support for social action groups from the setting of conventional\r\nbusiness and service organisations: Free / Libre Open-\r\nSource Software, techniques and technologies for engagement through storytelling, and learning and evaluation in social action.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Dearden, A.

In recent years, patterns and pattern languages have received considerable attention in HCI for their potential as a means for developing and communicating information and knowledge to support good design. This review examines the background to patterns and pattern languages in HCI, and seeks to locate pattern languages in relation to other approaches to interaction design. The review explores four key issues: what is a pattern? what is a pattern language? how are patterns and pattern languages used? and how are values reflected in the pattern-based approach to design? Following on from the review, a future research agenda is proposed for patterns and pattern languages in HCI.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Dearden, A.

There are varieties of experiences, good and bad, and we need to characterise these varieties if we are to improve user experience. In this paper we argue that enchantment is a useful concept to facilitate closer relationships between people and technology. But enchantment is a complex concept in need of some clarification. So we explore how enchantment has been used in the discussions of technology and examine experiences of film and cell phones to see how enchantment with technology is possible. Based on these cases, we identify the sensibilities that help designers design for enchantment, including the specific sensuousness of a thing, senses of play, paradox and openness, and the potential for transformation. We use these to analyse digital jewellery in order to suggest how it can be made more enchanting. We conclude by relating enchantment to varieties of experience.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["McCarthy, J.","Wright, P.","Wallace, J.","Dearden, A.

Co-operative evaluation is a qualitative ‘think-aloud’ technique used to investigate usability problems in interactive systems. In this study, the technique is adapted to examine both interaction problems and decision-making activities of subjects attempting to plan a weekend break to Paris. The results show that existing general accounts of decision-making in e-commerce are not sufficiently rich to describe decision behaviours in tourism.  Also, these accounts may be enhanced by reference to descriptions of tourism decision-making that pre-date the development of e-commerce. The findings also suggest that many existing web-based tools to support tourism decision-making are poorly matched to the needs of Internet users.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Dearden, A.

Taking a critique of quantitative methods and a focus on measuring sexual effects and attitudes as a starting point, it considers the proposition that qualitative work is more suited to an examination of the complex social, cultural and political constructions of sexuality. Examining studies into the way men, women and young people see, experience, and use explicit media texts, the article identifies the key findings that have emerged. Qualitative work shows that sexuality explicit media texts are experienced and understood in a variety of ways and evoke strong and often contradictory reactions, not all of which are represented in public debates about pornography. These texts function in a range of different ways, depending on context; as a source of knowledge, a resource for intimate practices, a site for identity construction, and an occasion for performing gender and sexuality. The article reviews these studies and their findings, identifying what they suggest about directions for future research, both in terms of developing methodology and refining approaches to sexuality and media consumption.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Attwood, F."],"dc:date":"2005-04-27","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Attwood.

In both these arenas a predominantly behaviourist model of effects and regulation has worked to cast the examination of sexually explicit texts and their consumption as a debate about harm.  The broader area of investigation remains extraordinarily undeveloped.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSexually explicit media is a focus of interest for academics because of the way it ‘speaks’ sex and sexuality for its culture.

Using Geerts and McCarthy’s REA (Resource-Events-Agents) model as its basis, the TrAM process manages to capture the ‘qualitative’ dimensions of business transactions and business processes. A key part of the process is automated model-checking, which CG has revealed to be beneficial in this regard. It enables models to retain the high-level business concepts yet providing a formal structure at that high-level that is lacking in Use Cases. Using a conceptual catalogue informed by transactions, we illustrate the automation of a transaction pattern from which further specialisations impart a tested specification for system implementation, which we envisage as a multi-agent system in order to reflect the dynamic world of business activity.

This paper describes, often in their own words, the experience of European occupational therapy students working together across national and cultural boundaries. Collaboration and teamwork were facilitated exclusively through an online environment, since the students never met each other physically during the OTIS pilot course. The aim of the paper is to explore the observations that here was little interaction between students from different tutorial groups and virtual teamwork developed in each of the cross-cultural tutorial groups. Synchronous data from the students was captured during tutorial sessions and peer-booked meetings and analysed using the qualitative constructs of ‘immersion’, ‘presence’ and ‘reflection in learning’. The findings indicate that ‘immersion’ was experienced only to a certain extent. However, both ‘presence’ and shared presence were found by the students, within their tutorial groups, to help collaboration and teamwork. Other evidence suggests that communities of interest were established. Further study is proposed to support group work in an online learning environment. It is possible to conclude that collaborative systems can be designed, which encourage students to build trust and teamwork in a cross cultural online learning environment.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Beer, Martin","Slack, Frances","Armitt, G."],"dc:date":"2005-02-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G Armitt, S Green and M Beer.

The loyalty of designers to particular technologies and to ways of working can divide activist communities and, arguably, has weakened the social action world’s performance in exploiting technology with maximum usefulness and usability.  In this paper, we present a lexicon for discussing technology and social action by reference to the intention and relationship to use, rather than to detailed functionality. In short, we offer a language to support discussions of social function, and thus to avoid premature commitment or argument about architecture or implementation details.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Dearden, Andy","Light, Ann"],"dc:date":"2008-06-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Agre.

Five case studies of such kiosks located respectively in an airport, railway station, car rental base, hotel lobby, and shopping mall are analysed to demonstrate the way in which the kiosks are implemented to meet the differing requirements of customers in different contexts. Case studies are analysed in terms of kiosk design and location, user profile, information architecture, interface design, communication, and commerce.

It can be argued however that MAS require levels of logic that the current Semantic Web has yet to provide. As ISO Common Logic (CL) ISO/IEC IS 24707:2007 provides a firstorder logic capability for MAS in an interoperable way, it seems natural to investigate how CL may itself integrate with the SW thus providing a more expressive means by which MAS can interoperate effectively across the SW. A commentary is accordingly presented on how this may be achieved. Whilst it notes that certain limitations remain to be addressed, the commentary proposes that standardising the SW with CL provides the vehicle by which MAS can achieve their potential.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Mizzi, D.","Browa, W.","Loke, J.","Polovina, S."],"dc:date":"2009-07-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Berners-Lee.

Although a range of agent tools and toolkits exist, there still\r\nremains the need to move the creation of models nearer to code generation, in order that the development path be more rigorous and repeatable. In particular, it is essential that complex organisational\r\nprocess workflows are captured and expressed in a way that MAS can successfully interpret. Using a complex social care system as an exemplar, we describe a technique whereby a business process is\r\ncaptured, expressed, verified and specified in a suitable format for a healthcare MAS.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Hill, R.","Polovina, S.","Beer, M."],"dc:date":"2005-07-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B Bauer, J Muller and J Odell.

In the UK, the success of TV shows like Sex and the City  and the ‘fashion ‘n’ passion’ of sex emporia like Ann Summers suggests that late twentieth century discourses which foregrounded female pleasure have crystallised in a new form of sexual address to women. This article examines how sex products are being marketed for female consumers, focussing on the websites of sex businesses such as Myla, Babes n Horny, Beecourse, tabooboo and Ann Summers. It asks how a variety of existing discourses – of fashion, consumerism, bodily pleasure and sexuality - are drawn on in the construction of this new market, how they negotiate the dangers and pleasures of sexuality for women, and what they show about the construction of ‘new’ female sexualities.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Attwood, F."],"dc:date":"2005-11-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Esther Addley.

In particular, they have attractions in their potential to bridge the digital divide. There is some evidence to suggest that the citizen uptake of kiosks and indeed other channels for e-government, such as web sites, is slow, although studies on the use of kiosks for health information provision offer some interesting perspectives on user behaviour with kiosk technology. This article argues that the delivery of e-government through kiosks presents a number of strategic challenges, which will need to be negotiated over the next few years in order that kiosk applications are successful in enhancing accessibility to and engagement with e-government. The article suggests that this involves consideration of: the applications to be delivered through a kiosk; one stop shop service and knowledge architectures; mechanisms for citizen identification; and, the integration of kiosks within the total interface between public bodies and their communities. The article concludes by outlining development and research agendas in each of these areas.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Slack, Frances","Rowley, J."],"dc:date":"2004-03-10","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Ashford, J Rowley and F Slack.

Post-processual archaeology has promoted plurality in interpretation, however, and archaeology more widely is required to make itself relevant to contemporary society; so, contemporary folkloric practices vis-à-vis archaeological remains are once again receiving attention. In this paper we examine contemporary Pagan understandings of and engagements with ‘sacred sites’ in England. Specifically, we explore how Pagan meanings are inscribed and constituted, how they draw on \u0027traditional\u0027 understandings of sites and landscapes, and instances in which they challenge or reify the \u0027preservation ethic\u0027 of heritage management. From active interactions with sites, such as votive offerings and instances of fire and graffiti damage, to unconventional (contrasted with academic) interpretations of sites involving wights and spirit beings, Neolithic shamans, or goddesses, there are diverse areas of contest. We argue archaeology must not reject Pagan and other folklores as \u0027fringe\u0027, but, in an era of community archaeology, transparency and collaboration, respond to them, preferably dialogically.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Wallis, R.

In examining and theorising competing constructions of \u0027sacredness\u0027 and its inscription today, we will draw on examples from well-known and less well-know British prehistoric places, to illustrate how claims and appropriations emerge from spiritual and political processes, and to question how places are themselves agents in the demarcation of their own sacredness. We focus on contemporary pagans as ‘new-indigenes’ and their engagements with the past and performances of spirituality on the stage of the heritage of Britain, as examined in our ‘Sacred Sites, Contested Rites/Rights Project’ (www.sacredsites.or.uk), now in its fifth year. From the deposition of votive offerings at West Kennet long barrow and long-running disputes over access to Stonehenge as a ‘sacred site’, to the display of ritual paraphernalia derived from archaeological contexts (a Thor’s hammer pendant, for instance), pagans perform their worldviews and engage with heritage in diverse ways. Pagan re-enchantment of the past not only re-places heritage, myth, artefacts, ‘cultures’ in/out of time, highlighting (im)permanence as a linking theme in our analysis, but also disrupts the fixed and unchanging ‘past’ imposed onto heritage by much heritage discourse – challenging the permanent to yield, bend and accommodate.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Blain, J.","Wallis, R.

Summer solstice at Stonehenge, with an estimated 21,000 celebrants in 2005, is only the most publicized appropriation (by pagans and other adherents of alternative spirituality and partying) of a \u0027sacred site\u0027; and conflicts and negotiations occurring throughout Britain are represented in popular and academic presentations of this \u0027icon of Britishness\u0027. This paper presents work from the Sacred Sites, Contested Rites/Rights Project (http://www.sacredsites.org.uk) project, a collaboration of archaeology and anthropology informed by pagan and alternative approaches and standpoints investigating and theorizing discourse and practice of heritage management and pagan site users.   Whether in negotiations around the Stonehenge solstice access or in dealing with numerous other sites, boundaries between groups or discourses are not clearly drawn - discursive communities merge and re-emerge.  But clearly \u0027past\u0027 and \u0027site\u0027 are increasingly important within today\u0027s Britain, even as television archaeology increases its following, and pagan numbers continue to grow.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Blain, J.","Wallis, R.

It will argue that consumers’ expenditure on sport by residents in Sheffield was greater than anticipated from national estimates, largely due to methodological reasons rather than increased spending. The paper will illustrate that conventional approaches, which use published data sources to measure sport-related expenditure are firstly, not a valid measure of sports spending and secondly, have omitted several items of sport-related expenditure from current estimates. The paper will explore the implications of these findings for policy makers and managers of sport and leisure services and will suggest that a review of methods used to calculate consumer spending on sport is required in the future.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, L.

However, the global trend towards the privatisation of state-owned enterprises makes the adaptation of SEA towards these industries all the more pressing. This paper addresses the place that SEA might take within the electricity sector, taking the privatised UK electricity industry as an example. Particular challenges are posed by the radical restructuring of the industry, designed to introduce competitive behaviour, making the development of comprehensive SEA processes problematic, and requiring SEA to be placed in the context of corporate environmental policy and objectives.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Jay, S.

This article explores the possible application of SEA within certain private-sector contexts where higher-level strategy-making itself is inherently weaker and development is often piecemeal and reactive. The possible adaptation of SEA to the preparation of a strategic document by a particular industrial concern in the UK is examined: this draws attention to the multi-actor nature of development processes within the industry. This leads to the suggestion that SEA in this setting should be thought of as a form of environmental advocacy oriented towards industrial customers, who are understood as sharing a decision-making role in infrastructure development.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Jay, S.

However, within the post-1945 British welfare state this professional project enjoyed limited success and social housing remained a fragile professional domain. This article explores the consequences for housing professionalism of the recent displacement of the bureau-professional \"organisational settlement\" by that characterising an emerging \"managerial state\". Managerialism constitutes a clear challenge to established forms of \"professionalism\", especially a weak profession such as housing management. However, professionalism is temporally and culturally plastic. Hence, the demands of managerialism, within the specific context of New Labour\u0027s quest for \"community\" cohesion, may be providing opportunities for a new urban network professionalism founded on claims to both generic and specific skills and also a knowledge base combining abstraction with local concreteness. The prominence in these networks of erstwhile \"housing\" practitioners may become the basis for a new, quite different, professional project. This argument is developed through both conceptual exploration and reference to empirical research. The latter involves reference to recent work by the authors on, first, the perception of housing employers of the changing nature and demands of \"housing\" work and its consequences for professionalism and, secondly, the professional project implications of the increasing prominence of neighbourhood management.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Furbey, R.","Cole, I.","Reid, B."],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Abbott.

While there has been a growth in literature relating to the specific economic impacts of sports-led development, including professional sport facilities, teams, and sport events, limited research has been undertaken on the contribution of the whole sport sector to output and employment. In the United Kingdom (UK), studies have focused on evaluating sport-related economic activity at the national level, yet despite the increasing use of sport for local economic development little research has been undertaken at the city level. To address this situation, this article uses the National Income Accounting framework to measure the economic importance of sport in Sheffield, UK. It shows that the value-added in 1996/97 was 165.61m or 4.11% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), approximately twice the amount predicted from current national estimates. It is argued that this can primarily be explained by previous studies under-estimating the economic importance of sport, largely due to methodological differences. It goes on to suggest that future research on the significance of sport should be undertaken at the local level to provide policymakers with information at the spatial level where regeneration programmes are being implemented.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, L.

However, despite this importance, research on its contribution to sport-related economic activity is limited, with information on this sector remaining the weakest part of current economic assessments of the UK sports industry. The research presented in this article examines the economic importance of the voluntary sector, using a case study of Sheffield. It demonstrates that the sports voluntary sector in the city is considerably smaller than was predicted when using national estimates, and that this is largely a consequence of methodological issues relating to previous research. The article suggests that in the light of the findings and the increasing use of sport in urban policy, there is a need to rethink the methodology used to evaluate the economic contribution of the voluntary sector in the future.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, L.

However, proposals to locate stadia in urban areas often prompt a negative reaction from local communities, fearing a decline in property prices. This paper will use a case study of the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and the City of Manchester Stadium to illustrate that in contrast to this widely held belief, sports stadia can actually enhance the value of residential property. Furthermore, it will argue that stadia also contribute indirectly to property value through the creation of pride, confidence and enhanced image of an area.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, L.

Laboratory research suggests that implicit processes dissociate. This study therefore examined implicit cognition in 20 head-injured patients and age and I.Q.-matched controls using a battery of four implicit cognition tasks: a Serial Reaction Time task (SRT), mere exposure effect task, automatic stereotype activation and hidden co-variation detection. Patients were assessed on an extensive neuropsychological battery, and MRI scanned. Inclusion criteria included impairment on at least one measure of executive function. The patient group was impaired relative to the control group on all the implicit cognition tasks except automatic stereotype activation. Effect size analyses using the control mean and standard deviation for reference showed further dissociations across patients and across implicit tasks.  Patients impaired on implicit tasks had more cognitive deficits overall than those unimpaired, and a larger Dysexecutive Self/Other discrepancy (DEX) score suggesting greater behavioural problems. Performance on the SRT task correlated with a composite measure of executive function. Head-injury thus produced heterogeneous impairments in the implicit acquisition of new information. Implicit activation of existing knowledge structures appeared intact. Impairments in implicit cognition and executive function may interact to produce dysfunctional behaviour after head-injury. Future comparisons of implicit and explicit cognition should use several measures of each function, to ensure that they measure the latent variable of interest.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Barker, Lynne","Andrade, Jackie","Romanowski, C.

A thematic analysis of Hansard and newspaper reports produced in Britain during the 1990s showed that opponents of the amendment to equalise the age of consent countered with three key arguments laying claim to ethical principles overriding the principle of equality. These were: (1) Principles of right and wrong take precedence over equality; (2) Principles of democracy take precedence over equality; (3) Principles of care and protection take precedence over equality. Two additional arguments (the health risks of anal intercourse, and escalating demands for gay rights) are also outlined. Our findings are discussed with reference to debates on other lesbian and gay rights issues, and we consider the ways in which we might best counter these arguments.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Ellis, S.

This slowing contrasts with the typical finding that priming leads to faster responding, and might suggest that HCD is a unique type of implicit process.  We extended Lewicki’s (1986a) methodology and showed that participants exposed to nonsalient\r\nco-variations between hair length and personality were subsequently faster to respond to faces with those co-variations than to faces without, despite lack of awareness of the critical co-variations.

Paradoxically, children appear to be insensitive to referential cues when resolving ambiguous sentences, relying instead on statistical properties intrinsic to the language such as verb biases. The possibility that children’s insensitivity to referential context may be an artifact of the experimental design used in previous work was explored with 60 4- to 11-year-olds. An act-out task was designed to discourage children from making incorrect pragmatic inferences and to prevent premature and ballistic responses by enforcing delayed actions. Performance on this task was compared directly with the standard act-out task used in previous studies. The results suggest that young children (5 years) do not use contextual information, even under conditions designed to maximize their use of such cues, but that adult-like processing is evident by approximately 8 years of age. These results support and extend previous findings by Trueswell and colleagues (Cognition (1999), Vol. 73, pp. 89–134) and are consistent with a constraint-based learning account of children’s linguistic development.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Weighall, A.

Whilst there are a number of published studies exploring campus climate for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans (LGBT) students and/or staff, these are primarily localised studies undertaken in State Universities and Baccalaureate Colleges in the US. The present study is a nationwide UK study of campus climate, based on survey data collected from a sample of 291 LGBT students from 42 universities across the UK. The findings show that despite the increased implementation of an equality agenda (e.g. equal access; widening participation) in UK Higher Education, homophobia on campus is still a significant problem and therefore universities are not perceived nor experienced by LGBT students as ‘safe spaces’ in which to be open about sexual orientation/gender identity. The implications of the findings for university policy and practice in relation to LGBT (and indeed all) students is also explored.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Ellis, S.

It was predicted that: (a) cross-sectional analyses would demonstrate good discrimination between the stages of change, (b) prospective analyses would allow for the identification of predictors of stage transitions, and (c) implementation intentions would explain progression from the preparation stage.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eDesign: This study employed an experimental longitudinal design.  Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental (implementation intention) or control conditions and completed questionnaires at baseline and at 2-months follow up.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMethods: 525 adolescents who were broadly representative of the UK population completed questionnaires at baseline and follow up (n \u003d 393) measuring: demographic variables, stage of change, theory of planned behaviour constructs, anticipated regret and moral norm in relation to condom carrying behaviour.  The experimental condition completed a self-generated implementation intention to carry condoms at the end of the baseline questionnaire.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eResults: Discriminant function analyses indicated that the stages of change could be accurately discriminated from one another cross-sectionally and that, longitudinally, the measured variables were able to predict transitions between most stages.

Their behavior and psychosocial orientation to quit were measured at baseline and 2-month follow-up. Main Outcome Measures.  Theory of planned behavior variables, nicotine dependence and quitting. Results. Significantly more people quit smoking in the experimental condition than in the control conditions, and the planning instructions changed intention to quit and perceived control over quitting, but not behavior.  Stage of change moderated these effects such that implementation intentions worked best for individuals who were in the preparation stage at baseline. Conclusion. Harnessing both motivational and volitional processes seems to enhance the effectiveness of smoking cessation programs, although further work is required to clarify inconsistencies in the literature using the stages of change.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Armitage, C.

As forgiveness is at the core of Christianity, this study returns to the Christian source of the concept to explore the meaning of forgiveness for practicing Christian clergy. Comparisons are made with a general population sample and social science definitions of forgiveness to ensure that a shared meaning of forgiveness is articulated. Anglican and Roman Catholic clergy (N \u003d 209) and a general population sample (N \u003d 159) completed a postal questionnaire about forgiveness. There is agreement on the existence of individual differences in forgiveness. Clergy and the general population perceive reconciliation as necessary for forgiveness while there is no consensus within psychology. The clergy suggests that forgiveness is limitless and that repentance is unnecessary while the general population suggests that there are limits and that repentance is necessary. Psychological definitions do not conceptualize repentance as necessary for forgiveness and the question of limits has not been addressed although within therapy the implicit assumption is that forgiveness is limitless.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Macaskill, A."],"dc:date":"2005-07-27","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H H Bloomfield and L Felder.

Resolution of these situations frequently involves forgiveness of the transgressor.  Despite this the concept of forgiveness has received relatively little attention within the counselling and therapy literature. The reasons for this are explored beginning with the association between forgiveness and the Judaeo-Christian tradition. Freud avoided the term forgiveness and psychoanalysts until very recently have followed suit. Ways in which forgiveness are conceptualised are explored. Difficulties related to forgiving associated with our conceptualisations of natural justice are identified. A cautionary note is struck about the dangers of pathologising non forgiveness given the enthusiasm for forgiveness in the current research literature and in Positive Psychology. Distinctions between processes of forgiveness are made which are particularly potent for counselling. A summary of the literature with regard to the health benefits of forgiveness is presented and some client dilemmas in relation to forgiveness are outlined. Most of the emergent research on forgiveness is being undertaken by academic psychologists and the argument is made that counselling psychologists are uniquely equipped to contribute to the growing research literature on forgiveness.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Macaskill, A."],"dc:date":"2005-02-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Tennen Affleck, Croog and Levine.

Using a moral developmental framework, the purpose of this study was to explore preferences for different types of moral arguments when thinking about moral dilemmas around lesbian and gay issues. The analysis presented here comprised data collected from 545 students at UK universities, who completed a questionnaire, part of which comprised a moral dilemma task. Findings of the study showed that respondents do not apply moral reasoning consistently, and do not (clearly) favour human rights reasoning when thinking about lesbian and gay issues. Respondents tended to favour reasoning supporting existing social structures and frameworks, therefore this study highlights the importance of structural change in effecting widespread attitude change in relation to lesbian and gay rights issues. The implications of the findings for moral education are also discussed.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Ellis, S.

Data were collected from secondary trainee teachers, their placement mentors in schools and university tutors. Data have been interpreted in the context of potential threats to the professionalism of teachers, through the introduction of managerialist influences in public funded education. The main findings are: that trainees think that the most dominant influence on developing understanding of professional values are their school placements ; there were little differences in the responses from four subject areas studied ; mentors and other lead teachers play an important role in the development of understanding of professional values; the grades awarded by mentors when assessing professional practice and values varies between the four subjects studied. The explanation for these findings is complex and is related to the understanding and interpretation of the standard by both mentors and trainee teachers. The findings highlight some of the difficulties in attempting to assess competency standards in an area that is underpinned by values and suggest that initial teacher training can best assist the development of the standard when it is approached in a critical way by all parties.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Holland, M.

The second aspect considers what the pupils (Year 10, age 14-15) think about the new learning opportunities. The project is set in the context of regional regeneration.  The paper concludes that the extremely positive responses from the sample of pupils in all three strands of the programme indicate that the greater emphasis on vocational work and work experience in schools is having a strong motivational effect on pupils who are responding with improved attendance, behaviour and achievement.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Holland, M.

These have been mapped against recently established UK maturity models. The main findings are that effective school leadership, understanding of the change management process, and engagement of staff are all very important for success.

In the absence of evidence on whether the term holds the same meanings for young people and adults (e.g. teachers, researchers, policy-makers), the paper explores \u0027adult\u0027 notions of sexual competence as construed in research data and alluded to in UK Government guidance on SRE, then draws on empirical research with young people on factors that affect the contexts, motivations and outcomes of sexual encounters, and therefore have implications for sexual competence. These data from young people also challenge more traditional approaches to sexualities education in highlighting disjunctions between the content of school-based input and their reported sexual experience. The paper concludes by considering the implications of these insights for developing a shared notion of what SRE is trying to achieve and suggestions for recognition in the content and approaches to SRE.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Hirst, J."],"dc:date":"2008-11-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Abdullahi.

The project is set in the context of regional regeneration in an area where unemployment is higher than the European (and national) average, due to the decline of traditional steel and coal industries and where the gross domestic product is less than 75% of the European average.  South Yorkshire is also an area where overall achievement in schools at all stages is lower than the national average and participation in post-16 education and higher education is persistently below national figures.

However there is usually a separation of responsibilities for these areas within schools. The introduction of a new Standards Framework and other government policies such as the remodelling of the workforce in schools (DfES, 2003, TDA, 2007a) provide schools with opportunity to revisit these roles. A consequence of remodelling has been a rapid expansion of support staff in schools to assist teachers and one aspect of this contractual change is that support staff are taking on administrative tasks, formerly done by teachers. A further aspect is that CPD Coordinators now have responsibility for staff development cross the wider workforce. During 2007, Schools have used remodelling as an opportunity to review their management structures throughout the school including the organisation of staff development and how the school is contributing to the training of new teachers. In this paper we consider how the role of the ITTC is changing using data from interviews with Head Teachers and ITTCs from a sample of secondary schools that are in partnership with Sheffield Hallam University.

This paper analyses OFFA\u0027s 2008 monitoring report and a sample of 20 HEIs\u0027 original 2006 and revised or updated access agreements (2008) to draw conclusions about the impact of these agreements on the notions of \u0027fair access\u0027 and widening participation. The authors conclude that institutions use access agreements primarily to promote enrolment to their own programmes rather than to promote HE generally. As a consequence of this marketing focus, previous differences between pre-92 and post-92 institutions in relation to widening participation and fair access are perpetuated leading to both confusion for consumers and an inequitable distribution of bursary and other support mechanisms for the poorest applicants to HE.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["McCaig, C.","Adnett, N."],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Adnett and G Coates.

In this paper, views of 12 year olds on transfer to secondary schools and views of 16 year olds on leaving school, as well views of their parents and teachers, are presented.  In addition, we examine differences in attitudes to school between the 12 year olds and 16 year olds.  We conclude that pupil attitudes appear to deteriorate throughout the years of secondary education, and that projects aiming to tackle this problem should be supported.

In Coalton, a former mining town in the North of England, a five year UK government funded initiative known as Charter for Transition has been put in place to try to overcome some of these difficulties and improve the learning opportunities for pupils aged 5-16. The programme takes place over a 5-year period in various stages, but in this paper we make use of data from the first two years.  The research team examines the viewpoints of teachers from schools that were receiving additional support in their efforts to raise achievement in phase one and the pilot phase of the project about what they saw as the main benefits of this work. We present the beginnings of our exploration of teachers’ judgements of this work, and what they saw as the difficulties with associating the project with pupil attainment.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Holland, M.

Government inspectors have found that trainees on this route are weaker in subject knowledge and subject pedagogic knowledge compared to trainees following the more traditional one year training course (PGCE) of which about a third of course time is University based. EBITT providers are currently seeking to improve the subject knowledge aspect of training. To support this work the TDA have published a model for developing trainees\u0027 subject knowledge for teaching and suggest that providers review their provision against the model. In addition EBITT providers must also meet a new requirement that the total training time should be a minimum of 60 days. This new requirement presents a challenge to EBITT providers as most of the subject knowledge enhancement will have to be school-based. This paper seeks to find out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n- how trainee teachers acquire subject and subject pedagogic knowledge while based in a school and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n \n- whether teaching staff in schools have the required subject and subject pedagogic knowledge and skills for this enhanced role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \n\nData have been collected from trainees, school-based mentors, school-based Initial Teacher Training Coordinators and University assessors over a one year period.

Alongside these changes, the Every Child Matters reform programme implies the need to pay attention to the importance of all categories of staff to the welfare of children. However, there has not hitherto been an adequate characterisation of the nature of the practice of workers other than teachers . This paper attempts to characterise the position of school workers other than teachers to better understand the distinctive nature of their practice. We focus on Teaching Assistants, Caretakers and Lunchtime Supervisors as three groups which are sufficiently different to enable us to develop a richer theoretical account of identity in the school workforce than has hitherto been available. We have argued elsewhere (Coldron and Smith, 1999) that a teacher’s practice and his or her development of that practice can best be understood as a process of active social location. In this paper, we apply the same theoretical understanding of practice to the work identities of these three groups of school staff. By better understanding the identities that their different positions and associated resources make available, we aim to provide a richer picture and a way of thinking of the work identities of staff in school who are not teachers, one that is not colonised by the ways of thinking about the higher status teacher group.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Coldwell, M.

Focus groups and unstructured interviews were conducted with young women and young men aged 15-16 years in a school in the north of England. Analysis focused on disjunctions between reported sexual behaviour in a park and in a bedsitting room, and the content of school sex and relationship education. Tensions between the accounts are considered for their impact on learning about sex, sexual negotiation, subjectivity and inter-generational understanding. Despite some negative experiences in sex education, the young people interviewed desired the affirmation and support of adults, and recommend sex and relationship education as the most appropriate vehicle for providing this. The value added outcomes of participation in the study, including consciousness and awareness raising, and the opportunity for reflection and debate and selves as \u0027experts\u0027, enhanced young people\u0027s view that non-judgemental and meaningful advice and guidance are possible in formal learning contexts.

The programme is intended to help secondary school students who are at risk of disengaging with school or underperforming for a variety of reasons. These students are selected as tutors, given training on how to work with younger children and placed in a local primary school where they support pupils\u0027 learning. Valued Youth can be seen as one of many initiatives in secondary schools on re-engagement in learning and contributes to the UK government strategy of extending opportunities and providing flexible learning experiences to meet individual learners\u0027 needs and aptitudes.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eEvidence from the USA has shown the value of the programme in reducing drop-out, strengthening youngsters\u0027 perceptions of self and school, and reducing disciplinary referrals and absenteeism. The evaluation discussed in this paper considers the effect of the programme in a UK context, not only in terms of young people\u0027s attendance, attainment and confidence, but also in terms of what sort of youngsters seem to benefit and the effects of financial rewards, if any, on the outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe paper reports on the first year of a two-year evaluation. Data were obtained from a pre- and post-questionnaire survey among tutors, a workshop with coordinators and visits to selected case study schools in several regions. Almost all tutors enjoyed the programme and would recommend the experience to others. There was a relatively low dropout and the programme was warmly appreciated by participating primary schools. We have evidence that Valued Youth markedly raises confidence, improves communication skills and keeps some at risk youngsters on track in school. Many types of youngsters benefit from the experience; those who lack confidence and have poor communication skills seem to make the most progress. Successful tutors tend to be those who are committed to the programme, willing to learn, are flexible and cooperative, and have some ability to interact with others, particularly children and primary teachers.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Trickey, S.","Coldwell, Michael","Holland, Mike","Close, Paul","Rybinski, D."],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J A Cardenas, Robledo Montecel, M Supic, J D and R J Harris.

(This was initially referred to as challenging behaviour, but it was recognised that the word is ambiguous, so it was replaced by \u0027difficult\u0027).  The groupworkers were asked to present an example of difficult behaviour, some of which are reproduced here, as part of a process to understand the meaning of difficult behaviour and to add context.  Nine themes arose from the work with the Children\u0027s Services groupworkers, and the article explores each theme and its implications for groupwork practice.  The article relates the topic of difficult behaviour to the wider literature and suggests that the key to understanding and working with these behaviours in groups is the ability of the groupworker to unlock the meaning of the behaviour, and to find a way to articulate this alongside group members.

It is the foundation of a statistical method called Bayesianism.  In health care research, Bayesianism has its advocates but the dominant statistical method is frequentism.  \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere are at least two important philosophical differences between these methods.  First, Bayesianism takes a subjectivist view of probability (i.e. that probability scores are statements of subjective belief, not objective fact) whilst frequentism takes an objectivist view.  Second, Bayesianism is explicitly inductive (i.e. it shows how we may induce views about the world based on partial data from it) whereas frequentism is at least compatible with non-inductive views of scientific method, particularly the critical realism of Popper.  \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003ePopper and others detail significant problems with induction.  Frequentism’s apparent ability to avoid these, plus its ability to give a seemingly more scientific and objective take on probability, lies behind its philosophical appeal to health care researchers.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there are also significant problems with frequentism, particularly its inability to assign probability scores to single events.  Popper thus proposed an alternative objectivist view of probability, called propensity theory, which he allies to a theory of corroboration; but this too has significant problems, in particular, it may not successfully avoid induction.  If this is so then Bayesianism might be philosophically the strongest of the statistical approaches.  The article sets out a number of its philosophical and methodological attractions.  Finally, it outlines a way in which critical realism and Bayesianism might work together.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Allmark, P.

This paper suggests that in tackling these it is useful to identify and separate out those elements of the problem that are genuinely ethical (e.g. can I enter a child into a trial if I am not in personal equipoise?) from those that are empirical (e.g. what is the evidence for a treatment\u0027s effectiveness?) and those that are formal (e.g. what do codes or the law permit?)  The genuinely ethical elements are examples of philosophical problems and must be tackled in a way appropriate to such problems.  In practice this usually means some form of systematic argument.  This is often frustrating to clinicians who are more used to the assuredness of empirical research.  The paper next examines two ethical problems that arise frequently in neonatal trials.  The first is equipoise and the related issue of recruiting parents who are not in equipoise because they strongly desire that their baby get the active treatment.  We briefly defend the recruitment of such \"desperate volunteers\".  The second is informed consent.  We discuss the nature and value of informed consent and suggest that clinicians can often obtain worthwhile consent even in very difficult trials.

The TOBY trial is a randomised controlled trial investigating the use of whole body cooling for neonates with evidence of perinatal asphyxia.  Obtaining valid informed consent for TOBY is difficult; as such, it is a good test of the effectiveness of continuous consent.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 sets of parents who gave consent to TOBY and with 10 clinicians who sought it using the continuous consent process.

Problems lay mainly with the parents’ competence and understanding.  Mothers particularly had competence problems in the early stages of consent.  The understanding problems were primarily to do with side effects.  Problems in both areas (competence and understanding) reduced markedly, particularly for mothers, in the post signature phase when further discussion took place.

Here “appropriate” means that the method is capable of establishing claims and developing concepts in bioethics and “credible” that the method has some plausibility, it is not open to obvious and immediate objection. It begins by suggesting why this claim matters and then gives a brief outline of Aristotle\u0027s method. The main argument is made in three stages. First, it is argued that Aristotelian method is credible because it compares favourably with alternatives. In this section it is shown that Aristotelian method is not vulnerable to criticisms that are made both of methods that give a primary place to moral theory (such as utilitarianism) and those that eschew moral theory (such as casuistry and social science approaches). As such, it compares favourably with these other approaches that are vulnerable to at least some of these criticisms. Second, the appropriateness of Aristotelian method is indicated through outlining how it would deal with a particular case. Finally, it is argued that the success of Aristotle\u0027s philosophy is suggestive of both the credibility and appropriateness of his method.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Allmark, P.

Some claim this practice is unethical for at least three reasons.  The first is that the notion of equipoise, which is often used as a justification for running a RCT, is subjective and value-based.  Desperate volunteers are clearly not in equipoise and it is their values that should take precedence.  The second is that clinicians who enter patients onto trials are disavowing their therapeutic obligation to deliver the best treatment to patients; they are following trial protocols rather than delivering individualised care.  Research is not treatment; its ethical justification is different.  Consent is crucial.  This leads to the third reason: desperate volunteers do not give a proper consent; they are, in effect, coerced.  We begin our reply by advocating a notion of equipoise based on, first, expert knowledge and, second, widely shared values.  Where such collective, expert equipoise exists there is a prima facie case for a RCT.  Next we argue that trial entry does not involve clinicians’ disavowing their therapeutic obligation; individualised care based on whims and fancies is not in patients’ best interest.  Finally, we argue that where equipoise exists it is acceptable to limit access to experimental agents.  In the cases desperate volunteers are not coerced because their desperation does not translate into a right to receive what they desire.  \u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Allmark, P.

Leucine 110, at the mouth of the active site in the ά-subunit of the hydroxylase component of sMMO, has been suggested to act as a gate to control access of substrates to the active site.  Previous crystallography of the wild-type sMMO has indicated at least two conformations of the enzyme that have the ‘leucine gate’ open to different extents and mutagenesis of homologous enzymes has indicated a role in control of substrate range and regioselectivity with aromatic substrates.  By further refinement of the system for homologous expression of sMMO that we developed previously, we have been able to prepare a range of site directed mutants at position 110 in the alpha-subunit of sMMO.  All the mutants (with Gly, Cys, Arg and Tyr, respectively, at this position) showed a relaxation of the wild-type regioselectivity with monoaromatic substrates and biphenyl, including the appearance of new products arising from hydroxylation at the 2- and 3- positions on the benzene ring.  Mutants with the larger Arg and Trp at position 110 also showed a shift in regioselectivity during naphthalene hydroxylation from the 2- to the 1-position.  No evidence was found, however, that mutagenesis of Leu 110 could allow very large substrates to enter the active site, since the mutants (like the wild-type) were inactive towards the triaromatic hydrocarbons anthracene and phenanthrene.  Thus, our results indicate that the ‘leucine gate’ in sMMO is more important in controlling the precision of regioselectivity than the size of substrates that can enter the active site.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Borodina, E.","Nichol, T.","Dumont, M.

During CNS inflammation there are alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM). A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) -1, -4 and -5 are proteases present in the CNS, which are able to cleave the aggregating chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans, aggrecan, phosphacan, neurocan and brevican. It is therefore important to investigate changes in their expression in different stages of EAE induction. We have investigated expression of ADAMTS-1, -4, -5 and Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) -3, by real-time RT-PCR. We have also examined protein expression of ADAMTS-1, -4 and -5 by western blotting and immunocytochemistry in spinal cord from animals at different stages of disease progression. Our study demonstrated a decrease in ADAMTS-4 mRNA and protein expression. TIMP-3 was decreased at the mRNA level although protein levels were increased in diseased animals compared to controls. Our study identifies changes in ADAMTS expression during the course of CNS inflammation which may contribute to ECM degradation and disease progression.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Cross, A.

Whole-complex sMMO oxygenase activity requires all three sMMO components: the hydroxylase, the reductase and protein B.  Also, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the hydroxylase alone catalyses substrate oxygenation via the peroxide shunt reaction. We investigated the effect of amine cross-linking on hydroxylase activity in order to probe the role of a gross conformational change that occurs in the hydroxylase upon binding of the other protein components. The cross-linker inhibited hydroxylase activity in the whole complex but this effect was due to covalent modification of primary amine groups rather than cross-linking.  Covalent modification of arginine side-chains on the hydroxylase had a similar effect but, most remarkably, neither form of modification affected the activity of the hydroxylase via the peroxide shunt reaction. It was shown that covalent modification of positively charged groups on the hydroxylase, which occurred at multiple sites, interfered with its physical and functional interactions with protein B and with the passage of electrons from the reductase.  These results indicate that protein B and the reductase of the sMMO complex interact via positively charged groups on the surface of the hydroxylase to induce a conformational change that is necessary for delivery of electrons into the active site of the hydroxylase.  Modification of positively charged groups on protein B had no effect on its function, consistent with the hypothesis that positively charged groups on the hydroxylase interact with negative charges on protein B.  Thus, we have discovered a means of specifically inactivating the interactions between the sMMO complex while preserving the catalytic activity of the hydroxylase active site which provides a new method of studying intercomponent interactions within sMMO.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Balendra, S.","Lesieur, C.","Smith, T.

The substrates degraded by ADAMTS-1, -4 and -5 suggests that they play a role in turnover of extracellular matrix in the central nervous system (CNS). ADAMTS-1 is also known to exhibit anti-angiogenic activity. Their main endogenous inhibitor is tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-3.\n The present study was designed to investigate ADAMTS-1, -4 and -5 and TIMP-3 expression after experimental cerebral ischaemia and to examine whether cytokines known to be up-regulated in stroke could alter their expression by astrocytes in vitro. Focal cerebral ischaemia was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat using the filament method. \nOur results demonstrate a significant increase in expression of ADAMTS-1 and -4 in the occluded hemisphere but no significant change in TIMP-3. This was accompanied by an increase in mRNA levels for interleukin (IL)-1, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). ADAMTS-4 mRNA and protein was up-regulated by TNF in primary human astrocyte cultures. The increased ADAMTS-1 and -4 in experimental stroke, together with no change in TIMP-3, may promote ECM breakdown after stroke, enabling infiltration of inflammatory cells and contribute to brain injury. In vitro studies suggest that the in vivo modulation of ADAMTS-1 and -4 may be controlled in part by TNF.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Cross, A. K.","Haddock, G.","Stock, C.

We see this development as a consequence of an increased awareness and recognition of what broadly could be labeled as a design perspective. We examine the transformational process, the metamorphosis, by which non-designer students become interaction designers. We identify and describe the barriers that make it difficult for the students to move through this transformational process. We also propose some pedagogical approaches that can reduce the barriers and improve the possibility for the transformation to occur. The approach that we have developed and describe consists of three parts. Based on a fundamental understanding of the nature of design, we have developed (i) a tentative transformational model of how non-designers become interaction designers; (ii) a special kind of conceptual framework used to support students in the transformational process; and (iii) design assignments based on real-world design problems. We end the paper with two conclusions. First we argue that there is a challenge in transforming non-designers into designers, but that it is possible if the educational effort is based on an understanding of design and on the transformational process with its barriers. Finally we argue that the experience of trying to turn non-designers into interaction designers is in itself a valuable research approach. Dealing with non-designer students reveals deep insights about the nature of the design process and makes it possible to better formulate what constitutes a designerly approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nDesign, Design education, Pedagogy, HCI\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Siegel, Martin A","Stolterman, Erik"],"dc:date":"2009-07-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C Alexander, S Ishikawa, M Silverstein, with Jacobson, M Fikidahl-King, I and S Angel.

Industrial design has been increasingly used with engineering design to enhance competitiveness. Research between the two fields has been limited and existing collaboration methods have not achieved desired results. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThis PhD research project investigated the level of collaboration between industrial designers and engineering designers. The aim is to develop an integration tool for enhanced collaboration, where a common language would improve communication and create shared knowledge. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAn empirical research using questionnaires and observations identified 61 issues between industrial designers and engineering designers. The results were grouped and coded based on recurrence and importance, outlining 3 distinct problem categories in collaborative activity: conflicts in values and principles, differences in design representation, and education differences. \nA taxonomy further helped categorise design representations into sketches, drawings, models and prototypes. This knowledge was indexed into cards to provide uniform definition of design representations with key information. They should benefit practitioners and educators by serving as a decision-making guide and support a collaborative working environment.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nA pilot study first refined the layout and improved information access. The final validation involving interviews with practitioners revealed most respondents to be convinced that the tool would provide a common ground in design representations, contributing to enhanced collaboration. Additional interviews were sought from groups of final-year industrial design and engineering design students working together. Following their inter-disciplinary experience, nearly all respondents were certain that the cards would provide mutual understanding for greater product success.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nLastly, a case study approach tested the cards in an industry-based project. A design diary captured and analysed the researchers’ activities and observations on a daily basis. It revealed positive feedback, reinforcing the benefits of the cards for successful collaboration in a multi-disciplinary environment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nIndustrial Design, Engineering Design, Collaboration, Design Representation, New Product Development.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Pei, Eujin","Campbell, Ian","Evans, Mark A"],"dc:date":"2009-07-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Ashford.

It acknowledges that such obstacles are common to design practices and much is already documented in organisational, business and management frameworks (Best, 2006, p. 97; Jones, 2003). However, the paper draws on the author’s doctoral research that explored how designers work within the complexities of politics and power dynamics and the agency they bring when working within such contexts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFirstly, the paper clarifies its use of the word politics by distinguishing between the \u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePolitical \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003echoices that designers make, to the embedded \u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003epolitics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e of power dynamics and hidden agendas. It acknowledges how the Political content and intention of design is widely discussed in communication design literature where designers have created political content toward a purposeful political outcome. The paper therefore focuses more on another political aspect to communication design practice that relates to values, relationships and power dynamics. These human aspects of practice are complex, ‘messy’ and are often implicit. The power dynamics within projects can significantly influence the way stakeholders have input into the design process and subsequent project outcome. The politics of the individual, organisation, community or the society can often abruptly and unexpectedly surface through designing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nBased on several interviews with a variety of communication design practitioners and project case studies from the author’s research, the paper highlights a role that designers can potentially play in addressing the ‘messy’ politics that can manifest through design projects. The research explored various design interventions to enable a variety of people with different values, opinions and viewpoints within a design project to collectively negotiate them through dialogue. It has discovered that such design interventions can be instrumental in facilitating the dialogic process amongst stakeholders to illuminate differences in values or hidden agendas. The paper proposes that the role of the designer, then, is to facilitate this dialogic process through design interventions to enrich the experience of dialogue and exchange amongst project stakeholders.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n \nHuman-Centred Design; Communication Design; Politics; Power-Dynamics; Design ‘Scaffolds’; Dialogue.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Akama, Yoko"],"dc:date":"2009-07-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Abrams, J Donath, M Susani, W Sack, R Ross and V Krebs.

As the practices are often new and still evolving, the professionals in the field need to position their own activities to the context in which they are practiced (Valtonen, 2007). In the case of industrial design, the practice is conducted and increasingly discussed in the realm of the economic world. When issues such as global competitiveness or companies’ competitive advantages are discussed, design is often seen as a mean to improve business. This is the case especially where(onko tämä where ok?)  competing on merely price or technological advantage becomes increasingly difficult. This paper shows how the designers present industrial design as an economically viable action and how the economic press represents industrial design in the context of economy. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \n\nEconomic Rhetoric; Industrial Design; Interviews; Media; Rhetorical Analysis\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Valtonen, Anna","Ryynänen, Toni"],"dc:date":"2009-07-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Aristotle.

Efficient use and more energy conservative usage patterns could be ways to approach this problem. However, electricity has for a long time actively been hidden away and it is rarely thought of unless it ceases to exist. From the perspective of critical design, we have been working to find methods to visualise electricity and electricity consumption in everyday life to promote environmentally positive behavioural change. In this paper, we are looking at how aspects of lifestyles can be used in design as central driving forces that could lead to changed behaviour. Attempts to promote behavioural changes related to energy consumption might be successfully carried out when people are offered desirable alternatives that are engaging and that do not impose a perceived extra burden in their everyday life. This argument is exemplified through two design concepts, the AWARE Laundry Lamp and the Energy Plant, which are examples on how to increase people’s energy awareness and offer them means for reducing their energy consumption in the home. Both prototypes are inspired by current trends in lifestyle as well as actual observed user behaviour.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nInteraction Design; Sustainable Design; Energy; Lifestyle; Persuasive Design\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Broms, Loove","Bång, Magnus","Hjelm, Sara Ilstedt"],"dc:date":"2009-07-20","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"W Abrahmse, L Steg, C Vlek and T Rothengatter.

However, in the current design process, these two forms of prototyping methods are normally used independently and converted from one to the other during different design phases. This conversion process is time consuming and expensive and also introduces potential information loss/corruption problems. If the design process requires many iterations, it may simply be impractical to generate all the conversions that are theoretically required. Therefore, the integration of virtual and physical prototyping may offer a possible solution where the design definition is maintained simultaneously in both the virtual and physical environment. The overall aim of this research was to develop an interface or a tool that achieves real time integration of physical and virtual prototyping. “Real time integration” here means changes to the virtual prototypes will reflect any changes that have been made contemporaneously to the physical prototypes, and vice versa. Thus, conversion of the prototype from physical to virtual (or vice versa) will be achieved immediately, hence saving time and cost. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nA review of the literature was undertaken to determine what previous research has been conducted in this area. The result of the review shows the research in this area is still in its infancy. The research hypothesis was developed through the use of a questionnaire survey. Totally 102 questionnaires were sent to designers, design directors or design managers to address the issue: will industrial designers want to make use of real time integration and if so, how? The outcome from the literature review drove further development of the research hypothesis and an initial pilot experiment to test this. The pilot trial was designed to address the research questions: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n•\tCan real time physical and virtual prototyping integration be conveniently demonstrated?\u003cbr /\u003e\n•\tWill designers and users be comfortable using the integration method?\u003cbr /\u003e\n•\tWill users recognise the benefits of the integration?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe results showed that real time integration between physical and virtual prototyping is necessary in helping designers develop new products and for getting users more closely involved. The future research suggested is that more investigations and experiments are needed to explore a proper method that simultaneously employing these two types of prototyping in product development process. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nPhysical Prototyping; Virtual Prototyping; Integration; Real Time.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Liu, Bingjian","Campbell, R Ian"],"dc:date":"2009-07-13","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Anderl.

Definitions, merits and uses of both low and high-fidelity prototypes are discussed and then the applications of prototypes in our research program into intuitive interaction are explored. It has previously been established that intuitive interaction is based on past experience, and can be encouraged by designing interfaces that contain familiar features (Blackler, 2006; Blackler, Popovic, \u0026 Mahar, 2007b). Two aspects of the research program which are relevant to prototyping are: researching the issues of how intuitive use happens and how it can be better facilitated; and developing ways to help designers include investigations about users and their existing knowledge into their design processes in order to make interfaces more intuitive. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe current and future planned applications of high and low-fidelity prototypes in each of these areas are explored. Then experiences with using high-fidelity touchscreen prototypes for experimental research into intuitive interaction are discussed, including problems with the prototypes, how they were addressed and what we have learned from the process. Next the potential for low-fidelity prototypes to elicit users’ tacit knowledge during the design process is explored. This has exciting possibilities due to the link between intuitive interaction and tacit knowledge. Finally, the challenges of developing prototype-based design tools for use by older people are discussed and future directions for using prototypes in our research program are considered.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \nPrototypes; intuitive interaction; experimental methodology; implicit or tacit knowledge\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Blackler, Alethea"],"dc:date":"2009-07-13","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Bastick.

The author is developing an instrumental use of critical artefacts as part of a human-centred design process. Earlier work showed the effectiveness of this approach in allowing stakeholders to engage with novel product ideas. This paper describes a project, Living Rooms, developing the approach with a broader group of stakeholders and devising the critical artefacts with other designers. Although providing insights into the design context (Bowen \u0026 Chamberlain 2008), this application of the approach was less productive than in earlier projects and suggested factors that could affect its efficacy. Implications for future applications of the approach are noted: the type of contexts it is appropriate for; the characteristics of effective stakeholder participants and the need to educate them in the context and enable them to think imaginatively. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nVon Hippel’s ‘lead users’ (1986, 1988) could provide a framework for selecting stakeholders likely to engage effectively with critical artefacts. The second part of the paper summarises lead user theory and discusses how the two characteristics of lead users, motivation and capability (Luthje \u0026 Herstatt 2004), tend to make them suitable participants for the critical artefact approach. A second project, Digital Mementos, is described – in particular how lead-user-based selection and the above implications have been applied. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe paper concludes by reviewing the progress in developing generalisable methods exploiting the critical artefact approach, noting the need to position the approach within wider design activity and points toward future work relating it to the entire product design process.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nCritical Design; Human-Centred Design; Innovation; Design Methodology\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Bowen, Simon"],"dc:date":"2009-07-13","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S J Bowen and P J Chamberlain.

Natural Design provides a meta-structural framework that has developed through our observations of engineering design in safety and mission critical industries, such as aircraft design.  Our previous work has produced parametrisable models of design work for software intensive systems, and we now look to make an initial assessment of our natural design framework for its fit to the more creative design practices.  In this paper we briefly sketch the framework and subsequently attempt to locate ‘creativity’ in it.  We find that, although there are good strong hooks for what the designer does, we are forced to find a role for the community of the designer in the creative process in our framework, something that was only implicit in our previous work.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \nNatural design; Engineering design; Creativity\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Hall, Jon G","Rapanotti, Lucia"],"dc:date":"2009-07-13","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M T Cannell.

Whether graphic designer, information designer, advertising executive, programmer, printer or the Managing Director’s wife, someone decided this picture, this type face, this layout etc rather than some available alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nHow are visual choices made? And, in particular, how do professional graphic designers make choices between visual alternatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nIt was decided to probe this question by interviewing professional designers and looking at their work. The initial plan involved some sophisticated analysis of variables but it soon became apparent that such an approach was not possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nSpecific interview questions such as, “You decided to use a picture of an elephant. Why an elephant and why this particular one?” met with responses along the lines of, “It just felt right” or “It’s intuitive”. It became clear that although some designers can tell a story about their choices, most designers make use of their experience and the experience of others to arrive at a decision that is not the result of some carefully thought out decision tree or a calculus of competing requirements.\nIt was felt by both of us that there ought to be a better way to describe this process of ‘just knowing its right’ than intuition. Eventually we came up with Purposive Pattern Recognition, abbreviated to PPR. One of us (M A-R) gathered the evidence from interviews, case studies and existing studies of Masters in Design (a title awarded by a US magazine, following a poll of its readership) The other one (J Z L) placed the notion of PPR in a conceptual framework using current thinking in neuroscience and in evolutionary memetics.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nGraphic Design, Intuition, Neuroscience, Memetics.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Langrish, John Z","Abu-Risha, Maria"],"dc:date":"2009-07-13","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Maria Abu-Risha.

How does a consideration of participation of both the designer and the user in the space change the design process? With participation comes understanding of the situation and by elaborating on possible futures with users, designers can find lucid innovations. We describe a project conducted by students from the Interaction Design course at the Royal College of Art in London which used a variety of approaches to speculate on the social and technological future of a London street.

They have to deal with increasingly complicated problems, like integrating the needs of various stakeholders while taking care about social, ethical and ecological consequences of their designs. To deal with this demanding design situation, they need to apply new methods to organize the available information and to negotiate the stakeholder’s perspectives.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThis paper describes how systems analysis supports the design process in a complex environment. In a case study, we demonstrate how this method enables designers to describe user requirements for complex design environments while considering the perspectives of various stakeholders. We present a design research project applying cybernetic systems analysis using the software \u0027\u0027System-Tools\u0027\u0027 (Vester, 2002). Results from the analysis were taken to inform the design of an electronic patient record (EPR), considering the particularities of the German health care system. Based on the analysis, we developed a set of requirements for every stakeholder group, detailing the patients\u0027 perspective with persona descriptions. We then picked a main persona as reference for the EPR design. We describe the resulting design sketch and discuss the value of cybernetic systems analysis as a tool to deal with complex social environments. The result shows how the method helps designers to structure and organize information about the context and identify fruitful intervention opportunities for design.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nE-Health; System Analysis, Cybernetics; Personas.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Bredies, Katharina"],"dc:date":"2009-08-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C Alexander.

Since product experience is multisensory, it is interesting to know which sensory modality plays a leading role in a particular experience, so that designers could concentrate on the creation of the most relevant product properties. It is often assumed that vision dominates other senses. In the present study, we investigated the importance of different sensory modalities during various episodes of product usage. We asked 120 respondents to describe their experiences with consumer products in the following situations: while buying a product, after the first week, the first month, and the first year of usage. The data suggest that the dominant modality depends on the period of product usage. At the moment of buying, vision is the most important modality, but at later stages other modalities become more important. The dominance of a particular modality may depend on its appropriateness for the particular task. During long-term usage, modality importance depends on product functions and the characteristics of the user-product interaction. We conclude that to create a long-lasting positive product experience, designers need to consider the user-product interaction at different stages of product usage and to determine which sensory modality dominates product experience at each stage.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nSensory Dominance; User-Product Interaction; Product Design\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Fenko, Anna","Schifferstein, Hendrik N.J.","Hekkert, Paul"],"dc:date":"2009-08-10","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Bertelson.

It looks at the design rationale used for the creation of what is fundamentally a system for recording dance knowledge on a score, as identifiable and replicable signs and symbols. A system made necessary because the conventions of other established disciplines, such as engineering and computer science practices, were no longer considered to be effective alone, in facilitating the production of well-designed cultural artefacts (Calvert, Fox, Ryman, \u0026 Wilke, 2005; Ebenreuter, 2005). \nIt is important to ask how can we understand design as a discipline amongst other fields of study with longstanding conventions and traditions and if the discipline of design offers effective ways of thinking about the creation and art of making products or services for the enhancement of the human experience? Is design a discipline because it adheres to existing and established rules of interdisciplinary knowledge from which it draws, or is it a discipline in its own right that as a significant field of intellectual development utilizes interdisciplinary knowledge as a basis for creativity and invention?”\nWhile there is no simple answer to these questions, the design approach adopted for the development of the prototype application ‘LabanAssist’ offers a working example in which the central theme of grammar, or more particularly the rules of a language, depart from the conventional use for its practical application. This application is one in which a literal understanding of grammar is no longer seen as an adequate basis for the generation of dance knowledge expressed via symbolic writing systems. Instead, this research focuses on the way in which the figurative aspects of language can be represented in the design of an interface to orient user thinking and facilitate the generation of diverse movement compositions. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \nLabanotation; Grammar; Literal; Figurative; Tropes; Poetic Constructs; Broad Terms; Interface.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Ebenreuter, Natalie"],"dc:date":"2009-08-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H Blumer.

In the field of instructional design this practice is not well established. In addition, many fields in which design is practiced are examining how knowledge is built by designers, and considering the methods of research most applicable to building design knowledge. We consider design cases to be the method of dissemination for that design research which is wholly of apiece with the act of design (as compared to design research carried out in the process of designing or research on design). In considering the factors required to establish this practice, we understand the issue of rigour to be critical, since without standards by which to judge the rigour of a representation this form of knowledge building may always be undervalued in comparison to others. We look to naturalistic inquiry and action research to begin exploring how rigour might be approached in developing design cases, presenting from the perspective of instructional designers and hoping to engage designers from other fields insofar as these ideas are useful to them.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nDesign Knowledge; Knowledge Building; Case Study/Studies; Design Research\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Boling, Elizabeth","Smith, Kennon M"],"dc:date":"2009-08-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C Argyris, R Putnam and D M Smith.

{"identifier":99984,"ep:Repository":102,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Enhancing the Reflective Capabilities of Professional Design Practitioners","bibo:abstract":"\u003cp\u003eAccording to Schon (1987), professional education should be centred on enhancing the practitioner’s ability to reflect before taking action. This is important to the designer for two reasons. The first of these concerns real world professional situations, which are rarely clear and lack ‘right answers’, the successful professional requires the ability to learn by doing in order to handle complex and unpredictable problems with confidence. The second concerns the nature of the designer’s relationship with design problems themselves. The designer’s exploration of his/her own awareness develops in parallel with problem definition. Dorst and Cross (2001) describe this as a co-evolution of problem and solution and English (2006) argues that we cannot frame the problem without including in that design space the person who designs. Thus the process of engaging with a design problem involves a journey of self-exploration for the designer who needs to be appropriately equipped for unknown terrain.  A distance learning Masters programme was validated in 1999, supporting professional designers to develop as reflective practitioners. The course has run successfully for eight years with students based in Brazil, Canada, UK and Ireland, Holland, Greece, Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and China. The author draws on the experience of delivering this programme to describe two approaches that have evolved in parallel to nurture the development of the reflective practitioner. The first of these encourages students to develop an action research process by applying reflective practice models as organising tools and recording templates. The second clarifies direction and focuses action to address fully and precisely the individual student’s aims, insights and motivation. Both these approaches encourage a synergy between practice and theory and involve visual modelling and collaborative reflection through communities of practice. The application of these approaches is shown to generate fundamental insights that positively influence the future actions of students in professional practice. The paper concludes that the consciousness of the expert designer is a critical element of design space and summarises how the disciplined process and clear focus of the approaches discussed contribute to the development of personal confidence and awareness. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \ncreativity; reflective practice; design process ; design processes\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["English, Stuart G."],"dc:date":"2009-08-10","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"W Carr and S Kemmis.

A number of theoretical frameworks will be discussed and examples of the analysis and modelling of key concepts and information relationships, using concept mapping software, collaborative ontology building systems and semantic wiki technologies will be presented. The potential of building information structures from content relationships that are identified by domain specialists rather than the imposition of formal, top-down, information hierarchies developed by information scientists, will be considered. In particular the opportunity for users to engage with resources through their own knowledge frameworks, rather than through logically rigorous but largely incomprehensible ontological systems, will be explored in relation to building resources for emerging design researchers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe motivation behind this endeavour is not to create a totalising meta-theory or impose order on the ‘ill structured’ and ‘undisciplined’, domain of design.

It seeks to create dynamic systems that might  help researchers explore design research theories and their various relationships with one another.

They all describe method structure but emphasise different aspects of it. Capturing these differences addresses common terminological confusions relating to methods. The paper provides an overview of the use of the fundamental method approaches for different purposes in designing. In addition, the FBS ontology is used for developing a notion of prescriptiveness of design methods as an aggregate construct defined along four dimensions: certainty, granularity, flexibility and authority.

The fierce rejection of 1st generation design methods in the early 1970s resulted in the postmodernist attitude of \"no methods\", and subsequently, after more than a decade, in the strong adoption of scientific methods, or \"the\" scientific method, for design research. The current situation regarding methodology is characterized by unproductive dualisms such as scientific methods vs. designerly methods, normative methods vs. descriptive methods, research vs. design. The potential of the early (1st generation) methods is neglected and the practical usefulness of design research is impeded. The suggestion for 2nd generation methods as discussed by Rittel and others has hardly been taken up in design. The development of a methodological tool / medium for research through design – MAPS  – (which is the central part of the paper) presents the cause and catalyst for some reflections about the usability / desirability / usefulness of methodical support for the design (research) process.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \nIntegrative Design Research Medium, Research Through Design, MAPS, Methodology\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Chow, Rosan","Jonas, Wolfgang"],"dc:date":"2009-08-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100046,"sim:weight":0.724728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.493871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.389704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.388328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.365461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.349419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1339,"sim:weight":0.341175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.335024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.333677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.318442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.314951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.308601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.300801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.298524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.297777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.296154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.295048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.271517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.259986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.246419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The notion is currently being used to denote a variety of ideas in design research, and we first seek to clarify some of them. We then present our own, specific take on this notion, while acknowledging that it is being used broadly. We adopted the notion as an umbrella term for our combined research and design activities: as investigative designers. We use it for the exploration of how designers can integrate designing and researching within a design process. The two main concerns we are pursuing within this are to clarify the role of a designer with research skills, and to explore the implications of a usage orientation in design. We present two studies in this paper in which we investigated how usage research for design can be specifically geared to the needs of design, and what helps designers (and what does not) in designing with usage information. In the first study, we ourselves conducted usage research, developed design ideas on the basis of that, and reflected on this process. In the second study, we observed how three other designers engaged with the same user data and developed design ideas. Our findings include that the designers tended to prefer to develop their own design ideas independently from the data, only checking or adapting the ideas to the data. Furthermore, the capacity of designers for dealing with data needs to be taken into consideration. Lastly, the form of data presentation influences how well designers can engage with it in designing.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nInvestigative Design; Designing; Designer; Product Usage; User Research\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Boess, Stella","de Jong, Annelise","Kanis, Heimrich","Rooden, M.J.

The paper will propose that a ‘travel guide to the un-natural world’ in the form of a design-led methodology is needed for research into sustainable development and is useful not only for the design discipline but for the research community at large. These premises have been derived from the aptitude of the design process and the creative methods it employs to deal with the complex messiness of issues such as sustainability.

Design of these abstract, intangible futures is difficult and carries a special risk of excluding people who are not equipped to appreciate the ramifications of these technological changes. The Democratising Technology (DemTech) project has been exploring how techniques from performance and live art can be used to help people engage with the potential of ubiquitous digital networks; in particular, how these techniques can be used to enfranchise people with little technical knowledge, but who nonetheless will have to live with the design consequences of technical decisions.  This paper describes the iterative development of a performance workshop for use by designers and community workers. These workshops employ a series of simple exercises to emulate possible processes of technological appropriation: turning abstract digital networks into imaginable, meaningful webs.  They were specifically designed to target a technologically excluded group, older people, but can also be used with other groups.  We describe the process of workshop development and discuss what succeeded with our test groups and what failed.  In offering our recommendations for working in this space, we consider the methodological issues of collaborating across science/art/design borders and how this impacted on evaluation. And we describe the final result: a recipe for a performance workshop, also illustrated on a DVD and associated website, which can be used to explore the dynamics of technical and social change in the context of people’s own lives and concerns. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nPerformance; Older People; Marginalisation; Person-Centred; Ubiquitous Digital Networks; Interdisciplinary; Technology; Future; Evaluation\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Light, Ann","Weaver, Lois","Healey, Pat"],"dc:date":"2009-08-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.637244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.560771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.555761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100441,"sim:weight":0.53978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.529127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.525946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.497782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.496543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.494852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.488877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.45624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88939,"sim:weight":0.450636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.446651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.438899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.426586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16699,"sim:weight":0.420473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.410954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2860,"sim:weight":0.372491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100018,"sim:weight":0.323627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16761,"sim:weight":0.318833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It briefly describes the development of a taxonomy of values used in design decision-making developed from a series of pilot interviews, protocol analysis and focus groups. This was necessary because although the values agenda is not new, previous studies were found to have gaps, or did not reflect the current state of play. From this more in-depth case studies were carried out to explore the influence of values in design decision-making. Eight designers were asked to design a lectern out of sustainable materials. They were given one day to complete the project. For one hour during the day they were asked to ‘talk aloud’ while being videoed, also known as concurrent verbalisation and protocol analysis. They also took part in a 40 minute retrospective interview about their design work, at the end of the day. One designer was asked to complete a ten day design project in order to verify the results against a longitudinal project. They also took part in a 40 minute retrospective interview at the end of the project. The paper presents some of the rich data collected during the study. And illustrates the ability to research the role of values in design decision-making.

The project is motivated by the increasing challenge of assessing subjective and intangible attributes that are associated with the teaching of emerging areas in design, and society’s growing need for measurable results. The goal of this project is to shed light on the perceived successes and failures of a specific assessment tool, known as a rubric, and use this information to improve students’ and educators’ understanding, value, and use of assessment tools. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nBased on the characteristics of the emerging design landscape, this paper argues the importance of assessments and the need for their improvement. It explains the construction of three assessment forms that are based on successful models used in other disciplines. This paper describes how the forms were used throughout the semester to provide an overview of course objectives and assess individual projects. It explains the contents of a questionnaire and describes how it was used at the end of the semester to evaluate students’ perceptions of the assessments forms. Feedback gained from the instructors indicated that rubrics were not more efficient than other forms of assessment but did aid the assessment of intangibles and did not reduce students’ creativity. The results of the questionnaire showed that students perceived the attributes of rubrics more positively than other forms of assessment but still favoured handwritten comments. These findings informed the proposal of a set of considerations that should be taken into account when creating assessment forms for use in classrooms that focus on emerging areas of design.

Outdoor advertising media, which are used to communicate visual messages from a sender to several addressees, participate in building the visual city culture and open manifold solutions in design.

The analysis shows that different modes, techniques and visual elements are applied to attract the attention of spectators and arouse interest towards the message of an artefact. The second analysis is based on communication studies and semiotics, especially on Roman Jakobson’s theory about the functions of communication. The method of combining two analyses reveals different ways of using visual language and syntaxes to announce the excellence of an advertised product, service or subject. It also shows various types of visual arguments used in advertisements. Three types of visual rhetoric emerge from the research material.

It has received greatest attention in design for the health sector, but has received less in office architecture, although this would seem not only to be beneficial for clients, but increasingly important in a changing business environment. This paper outlines the history and origins of evidence-based practice, its influence in the health sector, as well as some of the reasons why it has been found more difficult to apply in office architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nBased on these theoretical reflections, data and experiences from several research case studies in diverse workplace environments are presented following a three part argument: firstly we show how organisational behaviours may change as a result of an organisation moving into a new building; secondly we argue that not all effects of space on organisations are consistent. Examples of both consistent and inconsistent results are presented, giving possible reasons for differences in outcomes. Thirdly, practical implications of evidence-based design are made and difficulties for evidence-based practice, for example the problem of investment of time, are reflected on. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe paper concludes that organisations may be distinguished according to both their spatial and transpatial structure (referring to a concept initially introduced by Hillier and Hanson in their study of societies). This means that evidence-based design in office architecture needs to recognise that it deals with a multiplicity of possible organisational forms, with specific clients requiring case-dependent research and evidence gathering. In this evidence-based design practice differs markedly from evidence-based medicine. Finally, we suggest a framework for systematic review inclusion criteria in the development of Evidence-Based Design as a field of practice.

Tacit knowledge aids specific decisions. Student reports become analytical records of their material registers (sketches, physical and virtual models) making it explicit that which is implicit in those artefacts. This apparently confirms previous studies that suggest that knowledge per se not always triggers or controls decisions in design. Many physical as well as perceptive actions actually lead the initial steps and play a crucial role in the whole course of production. Besides serving as external representations, sketches and models provide visual hints that will be checked later, favouring the upcoming of the unexpected, stimulating creativity. The intent here is to point out how these different means of representation and expression contribute in a peculiar manner to the whole process of discovery and solution to problems in architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe authors propose here a reflection on the process of design and its uncertainties in its initial phase, concentrating on sketches and real models as experimentations.

Although their activities are recognisably related to more conventional designing practices, the materials they use in finding solutions are unusual in that they may include the beneficiaries themselves and other features of the social structure in which they are effecting change. We present an ethnographic study of practices in designing that focuses on social initiatives rather than the tangible products or systems that might support them. We explore the how design practices map to the process of winning local people\u0027s commitment to projects with a social flavour.

Package colour design was found to have significant impacts on both factors: similarity in chroma and hue between package colour and perceived fruit colour would lead to high product expectations.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\ncolour design; colour harmony; product expectation; perceived image colour\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Wei, Shuo-Ting","Ou, Li-Chen","Luo, M.

Is this what timelessness really means?","bibo:abstract":"\u003cp\u003eSustainability is always about regard to the environment: an intelligent use of resources and not returning to nature what it cannot degrade without long-term damage. Politics, business and thus research have been predominantly concerned with the direct impact on the environment of the diverse human activities in our society. There is of course awareness about all the indirect effects caused by these activities but as these effects are more complicated to identify and calculate, it could reasonably be suggested that these have not got the same attention and hence have not been thoroughly explored. Important resources are required for the production of objects, which subsequently turn out neither to meet humans’ needs nor to fulfil their desires. This issue involves not just the misuse of resources but also the addition to waste problems. Needs and desires are not unrelated to material and function but reach mostly beyond the physicality of the object as argued by Krippendorf (2006), among others. Timelessness is unrelated to physicality and is most likely the ultimate example of sustaining. However, this phenomenon does not easily allow interpretation as it is basically philosophical, which also would complicate its transition into other domains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe deconstruction of timelessness in an earlier work (Borjesson, 2006) resulted in the phenomenon being conceptualised as affective sustainability. Four notions were identified as mainly informing timelessness: time, tradition, aesthetics and perception. When subsequently studied in several disciplines, these notions produced indicators on how to understand better what makes objects retain their significance in a changing human context. These indicators are not to be categorised as a set of tools or even less as a model to be applied in the design process: they are directional rather than normative. Moreover, they are best understood as support and inspiration to develop design thinking and have been the subject for further analysis as part of continued research. This has increased the clarity of the directions not only in relation to design thinking but also where to continue research. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nSustainability, Human ways of living, Human ways of being, Lived and Learned experience, Emotion, Affect, Feeling, Cognition.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Borjesson, Kristina"],"dc:date":"2009-08-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.592428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85453,"sim:weight":0.568107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.542764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.504389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352134,"sim:weight":0.488442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109076,"sim:weight":0.486071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.478548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.464738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.445552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.444282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.437852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.420031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.410481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.40882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.395689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.388124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82088,"sim:weight":0.380452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.378915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100018,"sim:weight":0.318565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2916,"sim:weight":0.305696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper reports a study that was designed to explore the variety of roles that products can play in emotional experiences. In a three staged experience sampling study, 29 participants produced 170 records of emotions experienced while interacting with products. Each case was examined in order to identify the antecedent event (the event triggering the emotion) and the mental object (what the emotion is about). The results indicated that several types of events involved in the user-product interaction can elicit an emotional experience: noticing a product; an event occurring during product usage; an entire usage episode; an external agent mentioning the product; and a change in the relationship between a user and a product . It was also found that the resulting emotional responses can be about (can be attributed to) several types of mental objects: a physical object, such as the particular product involved; the user or some other person; the actions of the user or the designer; the antecedent event itself. The results are used to identify and discuss eight distinct roles that products can play in the experience of emotions. In addition, examples are provided to illustrate how these roles can facilitate a structured approach to design for emotion. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n\nDesign and emotion, user-product interaction\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Demir, Erdem","Desmet, Pieter M.

Considering Practice Through Symbolic Interactionism and Conversation Analysis","bibo:abstract":"\u003cp\u003eHow can scholars conduct rigorous research into the social activities that help constitute design practice? This paper considers this question through exploring how the interactive aspects of design may be fruitfully examined from the perspective of social psychology, especially through the approaches and methods of Symbolic Interactionism (SI) and Conversation Analysis (CA). The social activities of design refer to those situations wherein design is conducted in relation to face-to-face talk, or conversation. Since many aspects of design involve discussion, this paper argues that an SI-informed CA can offer an effective approach that may help us to better understand how communication and negotiation are central aspects of design. The author first outlines why social psychology is a significant perspective from which to study design through associating this perspective with the work of previous design researchers (Rittel, Schön). This is followed by an exploration of SI’s concern with the relationship between social structure and personal agency. Through considering design-based talk through an SI- focused lens, we can see how participants in design negotiate both personal creativity and externally-imposed constraints. The concepts of creativity and constraint are discussed in more detail through analyses of excerpts of conversations from two design-education critiques. These analyses demonstrate how CA’s methods can help scholars delineate the micro processes that link design practice to both personal opinion and wider social conditions. In summary, social psychology, SI, and CA are presented as distinctive, rigorous, and inter-related approaches that can help scholars of design practice to better understand the precise manner in which design is enacted through contexts of social interaction.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nConversation Analysis; Design Practice; Interaction; Social Psychology; Symbolic Interactionism.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Oak, Arlene"],"dc:date":"2009-07-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100007,"sim:weight":0.411912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100108,"sim:weight":0.383431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99990,"sim:weight":0.376754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99993,"sim:weight":0.348557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100039,"sim:weight":0.343943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.339604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100003,"sim:weight":0.326566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99994,"sim:weight":0.323627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100015,"sim:weight":0.318565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99983,"sim:weight":0.316891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100294,"sim:weight":0.281649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573531,"sim:weight":0.280439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100302,"sim:weight":0.26633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.245767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.226965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106355,"sim:weight":0.224771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9604152,"sim:weight":0.221934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100525,"sim:weight":0.214401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.206108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100008,"sim:weight":0.204316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The research focuses on the development of the specific identity of a new material. The research is aimed at demonstrating that product design can be used as a new strategy to create the material identity and thus to differentiate from existing materials. In order to design material specific identity in new products, we need to understand the perception process of shaped materials. Therefore we conducted exploratory study of materials recognition in products. We identified two types of products: the “messenger” products are specific shapes characteristic from the material; the “wrong messenger” products are imitations of other well known materials. The results of questionnaire about material recognition show that it’s more or less easy to identify material according to each product (whether it’s familiar or new shapes; whether it’s imitation or specific shapes and whether it’s well known or new material). We conclude on two types of shapes: on the one hand some familiar and typical shapes make easier and more certain the material recognition; on the other hand some new shapes make people more uncertain of what it is made of but more amazed. Designing amazing new shapes can be used as a new differentiation strategy to create the specific sensory identity of each new material. It means that the product can be a really useful support to fully communicate about a new material, beyond the traditional material samples.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nNew Material; Sensory Identity; Product Design\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Bergeret, Lorraine","Bassereau, Jean-François","Aoussat, Améziane"],"dc:date":"2009-08-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.471965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.324324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3170,"sim:weight":0.320605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.316361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.307545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.303186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.302675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.300064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.292708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.278383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99358,"sim:weight":0.261234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.260883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.248996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.246984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.239785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.230736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930219,"sim:weight":0.227848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3004,"sim:weight":0.223415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.222211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.202112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The material selection process is a complex process that is influenced and determined by numerous preconditions, decisions and considerations. The current material selection tools, however, focus mainly on the technical aspects of materials.

In the Design Process Planning, based on Action Regulation Theory, design concepts act as a compact guiding principle, including the anticipation of the artefact.

From experimental results for single-colour associations, 3 underlying factors were identified: “warm-cool”, “heavy-light” and “active-passive”, which were found to agree well with those identified by earlier research.  For colour-combination associations, an “additive property” of colour association was discovered: the semantic score of a colour combination can be determined by averaging semantic scores of each constituent colour in that combination.  According to the experimental results, there were 4 general patterns of colour harmony: similarity in hue and chroma, difference in lightness, high lightness and the hue effects.  While the proposed colour design tool is still in its development stage and has a number of shortcomings, the system is believed to provide practical assistance and support not only for unskilled users but also for designers.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \ncolour design; colour harmony; colour association; cross-cultural study; e-shopping; colour decision-making; design process; psychophysical method\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Ou, Li-Chen","Luo, Ming Ronnier","Cui, Guihua"],"dc:date":"2009-08-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100011,"sim:weight":0.661932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90036,"sim:weight":0.513042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933744,"sim:weight":0.468998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.263837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.24819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.235123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.205209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.191391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.187919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.186904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.186904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.185895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.183933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.171943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.163604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.154711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.154017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.150572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.141808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.133453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":100026,"ep:Repository":102,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Designing as Interpretation","bibo:abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThe paper suggests an interpretative approach to the empirical study of design processes. Design processes are conceived as social processes of interpretation and construction of meaning, and potentially of context generation. In contrast to models which conceive designing as a goal-directed process, an interpretative approach suggests a methodological reorientation. It assumes that design goals are more or less incomplete and vague at the beginning of a design process and are interpreted in contexts and in part are created by designers in the design process on the basis of their experience, embodied skills, and practices. The interpretative paradigm in design research seeks to observe, investigate, and describe practices that designers use in the process. Rather than attempting to determine and prescribe how practitioners ought to do their work, the research question is on how work is actually done - how interpretation is achieved by designers in particular design processes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAn extract is analysed in some detail in the paper. These data are taken from the transcript of a case study of a design process in practice. Sociological and socio-linguistic (‘sensitizing’) concepts such as frames and contexts are adopted to describe and analyze some practices observed in the episodes. The paper focuses on an aspect of designing – various forms of involvement and stances designers’ take on in the meaning making process of interpretative design work. Interpretative analysis takes into account designers’ alignments which constitute “participation frameworks” and ground designers’ multimodal practices in different media (language, drawing, gesture). Goffman’s (1981) concept of “footing” is used to reveal more subtle shifts in stances that designers take in designing. Investigation of referential practices designers use in some utterances in the observed design conversation suggests that designers step into, displace, and position themselves in transformed, “keyed” situations to experience the solicitations of design situations more directly and to take the role of others as well as the role of objects. These practices appear to be part of designers’ ability to construct meaning by establishing perspectives and getting “maximal grip” on design situations so as to exert their skills. Analysis of types of stances designers take in an observed design process, some of which addressed in the paper, may provide a way to describe an aspect of designers’ artistry and to characterize the particularities of unique design processes. The suggested approach is intended to contribute to a better theoretical understanding of designing and to the methodology of design research as an ‘epistemology of practice’. Interpretative analysis also aims to provide description of designers’ practices which may, as its practical benefits, contribute to ‘the reflective turn’ in design research. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nDesign Research Methodology; Design Practices; Framing; Case Study\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Glock, Friedrich"],"dc:date":"2009-08-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.568335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89407,"sim:weight":0.502824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.456919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.439436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.405564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.399757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1339,"sim:weight":0.399076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.389557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.388585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.379432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.372523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2820,"sim:weight":0.366745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.356107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.349097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.346005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16699,"sim:weight":0.329899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3215,"sim:weight":0.329459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3200,"sim:weight":0.324984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.312802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71305,"sim:weight":0.286518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this research is to investigate the multiple age-related changes of Chinese older vehicle users in order to assist designers to better understand current and future older users’ needs. Although qualitative interpretative approaches have rarely been applied in the field of traffic gerontology research, they are widely used in current design research to explore persons’ lived experiences, behaviours and emotions. Therefore, this study employed qualitative research methods consisting of observation, interview, travel logbook and co-discovery to explore older vehicle users’ travel needs. The interpretative analysis confirmed that multiple methods such as interview, travel logbook, and co-discovery are useful to gain a holistic understanding of older drivers’ travel needs. However, the one journey driving observation cannot provide valuable categories to explore older users’ multiple travel needs due to daily living context absence in the one trip experiment. It is clear that the useful methods for determining research for older users will depend on the product. The findings demonstrate that Chinese future older generations are more concerned about their age-related differences from social and cultural perspective rather than physiological perspective. Social and cultural context play important role to shape older vehicle users’ future travel needs. From design a point of view, understanding the social activity and cultural context surrounds older vehicle users should make it possible to predict older drivers’ needs related to vehicle property.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nOlder Vehicle Users; Cultural Context; Social Context; Vehicle Design; Qualitative Research\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhao, Chao","Popovic, Vesna","Ferreira, Luis","Lu, Xiaobo"],"dc:date":"2009-08-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.378339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.336598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334317,"sim:weight":0.335443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.301137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.296242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.292785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.28933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.284821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.279887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.275142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.273206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.270084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.266949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.255836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.253807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.252654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.242059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.236751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334052,"sim:weight":0.218276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.211406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The studies provide evidence that qualities that align one or other of the three modes of argument figure significantly in the criteria that examiners bring to the assessment process. Embedded in the studies are respondents’ comments that suggest that the range of conceptions of argument held by PhD examiners is broad. Explicit use of the term “argument” is often made in reference to a minimal concept of argument ¬– “argument as structure.” However, the reported comments indicate a significant bias towards qualities associated with concepts of argument that lie somewhere along the spectrum between “argument as confrontation” and “argument as dialogical encounter” as a marker of quality in PhD research. Drawing on the work of Hans Georg Gadamer the paper will explore the possibilities opened up by adopting the view of “argument as dialogical encounter” in the context of the PhD.

Embodied approaches to technology design could thus be found in Winograd \u0026 Flores (1986), Dourish (2001), Lund (2003), Klemmer, Hartman \u0026 Takayama (2006), Hornecker \u0026 Buur (2006), Hurtienne \u0026 Israel (2007) among others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nHowever, fertile as this cross-disciplinary import may be, design research can generally be criticised for being ‘undisciplined’, because of its tendency merely to take over reductionist ideas of embodied meaning from those neighbouring disciplines without questioning the inherent limitations it thereby subscribe to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nIn this paper I focus on this reductionism and what it means for interaction design research. I start out by introducing the field of interaction design and two central research questions that it raises. This will serve as a prerequisite for understanding the overall intention of bringing the notion of ‘embodied meaning’ from cognitive semantics into design research. Narrowing my account down to the concepts of ‘image schemas’ and their ‘metaphorical extension’, I then explain in more detail what is reductionistic about the notion of embodied meaning. Having done so, I shed light on the consequences this reductionism might have for design research by examining a recently developed framework for intuitive user interaction along with two case examples. In so doing I sketch an alternative view of embodied meaning for interaction design research.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nInteraction Design, Embodied Meaning, Tangible User Interaction, Design Theory, Cognitive Semiotics\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Markussen, Thomas"],"dc:date":"2009-08-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.499866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.406838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89407,"sim:weight":0.404505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.368892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.35933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1339,"sim:weight":0.336193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.316601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.311555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.310431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.304971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.300228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.274894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.273513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71305,"sim:weight":0.257656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.25199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9636137,"sim:weight":0.209235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999700,"sim:weight":0.199369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A wide range of design literature already discusses the pragmatic benefits and ethical importance of user-centered design, while the literature on co-design suggests that designed outcomes are more successful if the design process considers the interests of all stakeholders. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese discussions can be compelling, but the inherent challenges in engaging others’ perspectives and knowledge in the design process are less acknowledged, Wenger’s ideas on the social dynamics of group enterprise offering designers valuable insights into the actuality of negotiating designed outcomes with non-designer stakeholders. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe paper has two main aspects.

This paper investigates the methods of managing design in order to enhance companies’ competitiveness in internet business. The main research processes are to: (1) explore the current state of internet service design in Korea through in-depth interviews with professional designers and survey questionnaires to 30 digital design agencies and 60 clients; (2) compare how design is managed between in-house design groups and digital design agencies though the case studies of five Korean companies; and (3) develop a taxonomy characterizing four roles of designers in conjunction with the levels of their strategic contributions to internet service innovation: visualist, solution provider, concept generator, and service initiator.

This change is also calling for a new design approach. The challenge for designers is not only to be able to provide local and highly individualised solutions, but also to propose strategies to transfer and reproduce the solutions, or part of them, into different local contexts, thus creating economy of scope. This would be possible by using forms of codification and modularisation of the most relevant components in local solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe code refers to the organisational knowledge included in local components and the way each component interacts with the others.

Usage of anthropomorphic form has long been a basic design strategy, particularly in the design of intelligent service robots. As such, it is desirable to use anthropomorphic form not only in aesthetic design but also in interaction design. Proceeding from how anthropomorphism in various domains has taken effect on human perception, we assumed that anthropomorphic form used in appearance and interaction design of robots enriches the   explanation of its function and creates familiarity with robots. From many cases we have found, misused anthropomorphic form lead to user disappointment or negative impressions on the robot. In order to effectively use anthropomorphic form, it is necessary to measure the similarity of an artifact to the human form (humanness), and then evaluate whether the usage of anthropomorphic form fits the artifact. The goal of this study is to propose a general evaluation framework of anthropomorphic form for robot design. We suggest three major steps for framing the evaluation: \u0027measuring anthropomorphic form in appearance\u0027, \u0027measuring anthropomorphic form in Human-Robot Interaction\u0027, and \u0027evaluation of accordance of two former measurements\u0027.

There is a threat that assumptions from marketing research in regard to branding the environment will begin to have a greater impact on the designed environment, but without having any architecturally oriented studies to orientate the processes or outcomes. This paper outlines the process for mapping the consensus mental model of a building, and a way of reading the mental model to understand the brand feel of the building. Understanding the ability of architecture to communicate messages in terms of ‘brand feel’ need not need be a fearful element of future building developments. In fact, by placing market value on architecture as a form of communication can lead to real consideration of its effect on the end users. This method for mapping mental models may also be informative for other fields of design.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \nMental models; Architectural design; Workplaces; Qualitative research; Branding. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor full details of this paper, presented at the DRS2008 conference, please contact the author direct.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Wheatley, Donna"],"dc:date":"2009-07-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100082,"sim:weight":0.403305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100302,"sim:weight":0.378993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100004,"sim:weight":0.355257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100294,"sim:weight":0.340172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99986,"sim:weight":0.339636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100046,"sim:weight":0.329818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100070,"sim:weight":0.323878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99998,"sim:weight":0.316459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100056,"sim:weight":0.314363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100024,"sim:weight":0.312721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100525,"sim:weight":0.311999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100023,"sim:weight":0.301175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99984,"sim:weight":0.300734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99981,"sim:weight":0.300601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99996,"sim:weight":0.300272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100029,"sim:weight":0.298834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100090,"sim:weight":0.297902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99961,"sim:weight":0.291401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100015,"sim:weight":0.286589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100111,"sim:weight":0.280937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Further, it attempts to identify new opportunities for further research regarding “product-servicization” vs. “service-productization”.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the continued efforts to provide the users with fuller experiences, one major trend is the blending of products and services. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch existing research seems to either present cases or propose frameworks regarding the ‘connection’, rather than ‘integration’ between products and services. Broadly, two major approaches seem to exist in this area: 1. product-servicization, 2. service-productization. The former generally indicates adding more services to existing products, whereas the latter generally refers to making services tangible and/or visible in the form of a product. However, findings of an extensive literature search conducted for this study suggest one important deficiency in dealing with service issues around the product: the ‘integration’ between the actual product design and service elements for supporting new service-product system. That is the rationale behind this research, an attempt to investigate the possibility for the integration of product design and service factors which could be embedded in the design of product itself in new service-product system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThis paper is largely based on qualitative research.

In this research, a school environment was selected for a practical test of robotic products. For this, the robot “Tiro” was built, with the aim of supporting the learning activities of children. The possibility of applying robotic products was then tested through example lessons using Tiro. To do this, the robot design process and user-centred HRI evaluation framework were studied, and observations of robotic products were made via a field study on the basis of these understandings. Three different field studies were conducted, and interactions between children and robotic products were investigated. As a result, it was possible to understand how emotional interaction and verbal interaction affect the development of social relationships. Early results regarding this and coding schemes for video protocol analysis were gained. In this preliminary study, the findings are summarized and several design implications from insight grouping are suggested.

Learners are, to use Mayer’s (1996) constructivist definition, ‘sense makers’. We can therefore position this to mean that, if learners are sense makers, then learning strategies are essentially cognitive processes used when learners are striving to make sense out of newly presented material. This paper intends to demonstrate that such thoughts and behaviours can be made explicit and that students can co-ordinate the basic cognitive processes of selecting, organising and integrating. I will discuss two learning strategies which were developed during three cycles of an action research enquiry with a group of illustration students. While each cycle had its own particular structure and aims, the main task, that of illustrating a passage of expository text into an illustration was a constant factor. The first learning strategy involved assisting students develop ‘macropropositions’—personal understandings of the gist or essence of a text (Louwerse and Graesser, 2006; Armbruster, Anderson and Ostertag,  1987; Van Dijk \u0026 Kintsch, 1983). The second learning strategy used a form of induction categorised as analogical reasoning (Holyoak, 2005; Sloman and Lagnado, 2005). Both strategies were combined to illustrate the expository text extract.

A co-design methodology and the results of its application in branding the Waterfall Way (New South Wales, Australia) as an eco- and nature-based tourism destination are presented as an example. The co-design exercise actively involved stakeholders in all stages of the design process, harnessing local tacit knowledge in relation to communication design, stimulating reflection upon what is special about the places, and consequently reinforcing a sense of belonging and the environmental and cultural conservation of place. The achieved results reflect the involvement and ownership of the community towards the design process. However, the application of a collaborative brand design methodology produced more than just a destination brand that is attractive to visitors, in line with local values, ways of living and the environment. It helped to catalyse a social network around tourism, triggering self-organising activity amongst stakeholders, who started to liaise with each other around the emergent regional identity - represented by the new brand they created together. The Waterfall Way branding process is a good example of social construction of shared understanding in and through design, showing that design exercises can have a significant social impact not only on the final product, but also on the realities of people involved in the process.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \nDestination Branding; Collaborative Process; Social Design; Self Organising Systems; Sustainable Tourism\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Taboada, Manuela","Haworth, Robert J","Spence, Rebecca"],"dc:date":"2009-07-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.513686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.472797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.411388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.403501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100066,"sim:weight":0.403305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.400855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.399423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.385114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.377262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.376364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.360277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.336715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.326444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":829,"sim:weight":0.3209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.309647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.309246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9611158,"sim:weight":0.307305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.300213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.298643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109246,"sim:weight":0.297363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

And yet, visual culture, and the design process that contributes to its materialisation in specific contexts, offers an opportunity to recognise a socially inclusive activity that reveals similarity rather than difference. This paper celebrates an ephemeral aesthetic that is appreciated by people at different ends of the economic, political and social spectrum. A mutual appreciation for the medium of collage differs only in terms of the environment within which the recycled object is eventually revealed. This paper explores some of these different contexts, and those who recognise and practise this phenomenon in a South American and European context. The conclusion of this speculative and exploratory study is that there is potential to develop this unique medium as an accessible and inclusive visual language, giving voice to those who often do not have the opportunity or the means to speak and be heard. Collage is recognised as a channel that mediates between social exclusion and inclusion when political and economic means have been exhausted. The resulting ephemeral aesthetic is proven to have visual appeal, satisfying low- and high-order human needs.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nBricolage; Ephemeral Aesthetic; Urban Poor; Human Need; Graphic Design\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Harland, Robert","Loschiavo Santos, Maria Cecilia"],"dc:date":"2009-07-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.467999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.464554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.41984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.415418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352197,"sim:weight":0.4151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.414805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99288,"sim:weight":0.394066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.390181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.382318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.380631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.378171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.373908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.373908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48268,"sim:weight":0.37364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.366832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.355227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.35232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.340038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447316,"sim:weight":0.335066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382030,"sim:weight":0.330811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Discourse analysis that applies the theory of governmentality is used to assess previously collected, open-ended interviews with graphic designers, as well as other source material. Based on the late work of Michel Foucault, governmentality considers how authorities govern through the creation and dissemination of knowledge, which works through individuals’ desires and beliefs and leads to unpredictable outcomes. In this research, two ‘authorities’ within the graphic design profession are identified and considered – design competitions and graphic design higher education. Both authorities are loose and heterogeneous, spread across many organizations, locations, and individuals. These authorities govern through the creation and production of knowledge about what graphic design is and how to practice it. Governing is evidenced in documents, on Web sites, in education accreditation materials, and via practitioners’ and educators’ discourse. Governing works through practitioners’, educators’, and students’ desires to have their work validated by their peers, instructors, critics, judges, and the profession. The outcomes of this governing are varied. Practitioners accepted the awards, found external venues for validation, and questioned the structure and nature of the competitions. Educators questioned the composition and premise of graphic design education and shared knowledge about classroom policies.

Many consumers do not make the link between their daily consumption behaviour in the household and environmental problems such as climate change. In the 21st century, the residential sector, together with transport and industry, is one of the largest man-made contributors in the UK to climate change. It is argued that technological innovations, current eco-efficient products and consumer education have been ineffective in creating the long term radical behavioural change needed to reduce the impact of product use. Products, as the interface between consumers and consumption activities, have the potential to influence the way in which consumption occurs. In the sustainable design field however, designer responsibility traditionally considers raw material selection and product disposal. There is limited work that addresses the environmental impacts relating directly to use behaviour of the product. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThis paper illustrates that user behaviour studies can be the preliminary step for designers to improve energy efficiency of products. A single product type, household cold appliance, was chosen as a case to explore the capacity of designer-conducted user study to identify unsustainable aspects of product use. Adopting a user-centred approach, two pilot studies were used to gain an insight into domestic fridge and freezer use in the UK. Qualitative ethnographical research methods were employed to investigate the daily practices and “real” needs of user as well as the connection between the knowledge, attitudes, intention and actual action. The design suggestions drawn from the user behaviour analysis provide examples of how energy impact level of the interaction with the product can be reduced through design. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nUser-Centred Research; Sustainable Product Design; Changing Consumer Behaviour; Design Research; Household Energy Consumption; Household Cold Appliance.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Tang, Tang","Bhamra, Tracy A"],"dc:date":"2009-07-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.471601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.443396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3170,"sim:weight":0.439993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.399577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334806,"sim:weight":0.395459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.372295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2802401,"sim:weight":0.369824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.358321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334965,"sim:weight":0.356171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.354898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.346623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2802393,"sim:weight":0.344554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.340288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.339073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.326834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.326834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.326706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336250,"sim:weight":0.314175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.30026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.299111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although our whole world is turning ever more digital, our bodies and minds are naturally conceived to interact with the physical. Very often, in the design of user-targeted information appliances, the physical and digital processes are formulated separately and usually, due to cost factors, they are only brought together for user testing at the end of the development process. This not only makes major design changes more difficult but it can also significantly affect the users’ level of acceptance of the product and their experience of use. It is therefore imperative that designers explore the relationship between the physical and the digital form early on in the development process, when one can rapidly work through different sets of ideas. The key to gaining crucial design information from products lies in the construction of meaningful prototypes. This paper specifically examines how physical materials are used during the early design stage and seeks to explore whether the inherent physical properties of these artefacts and the way that designers interpret and manipulate them have a significant impact on the design process. We present the findings of a case study based on information gathered during a design exercise. Detailed analysis of the recordings reveals far more subtle patterns of behaviour than expected. These include the ways in which groups move between abstract and concrete discussions, the way groups comply with or resist the materials they are given, and the complex interactions between the physicality of materials and the group dynamics. This understanding is contributing to ongoing research in the context of our wider agenda of explicating the fundamental role of physicality in the design of hybrid physical and digital artefacts. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nPhysicality; Digitality; Product Design; Design Process; Prototyping; Materials\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Ramduny-Ellis, Devina","Hare, Joanna","Dix, Alan","Gill, Steve"],"dc:date":"2009-07-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.614737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.472453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.452677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.44392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.417722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.410285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.407391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.391557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.385695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100018,"sim:weight":0.383431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.364252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.352322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3203,"sim:weight":0.347677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.336333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22884,"sim:weight":0.307614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.306436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2916,"sim:weight":0.276544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933891,"sim:weight":0.267991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59326,"sim:weight":0.216125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334807,"sim:weight":0.121845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of the research was to describe how a group of people, in this case: students and teaches, come to agree upon what a good quality form is. The chosen way of explaining the notion of form quality in design engaged a socio-constructivistic approach, based in the theories of Bourdieu and Foucault and others. It rendered form quality as something constructed by the individual in interaction with artefacts and other individuals. The object of the study was to explore the mechanisms of this construction, separated into dynamical aspects (the actual construction) and the hierarchical aspects (the restrictions) of the constructive mechanisms. Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis of communication (verbal, visual and more) about form was the methodology chosen. This paper discusses certain fundamental methodological questions concerning the use of this perspective and this methodology in a design process. It asks in what way it is convenient to study something as material as an artefact’s form as something as immaterial as construction, communication and text. The paper is based on specific examples from the thesis presenting the research, ending with a short conclusive discussion concerning the opportunity this perspective gave to avoid a dichotomist basis (in the artefact it self or in the eyes of the beholder) for theories concerning form quality, and to sustain a focus on the communicational and relational aspects of the designing process. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\nForm Quality, Formbild, Socio-Constructivism, Discourse Analysis, Methodological Considerations\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Gulliksen, Marte S"],"dc:date":"2009-07-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.550977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.544515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.543206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.524355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.522198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.521768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.5027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.502257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.502005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.501995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.484627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.463979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.461867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.456114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.453875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.449758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.449758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.448406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48240,"sim:weight":0.428049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.423728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The authors analyzed the characteristics of the creative design process by comparing it with the linguistic interpretation process, from the viewpoints of thought types (analogy, blending, and thematic relation) and recognition types (commonalities and alignable and nonalignable differences). A new concept can be created by using the noun-noun phrase as the process of synthesizing two concepts—the simplest and most essential process in formulating a new concept from existing ones. Furthermore, the noun-noun phrase can be interpreted in a natural way. In our experiment, the subjects were required to interpret a novel noun-noun phrase, create a design concept from the same noun-noun phrase, and list the similarities and dissimilarities between the two nouns. The authors compare the results of the thought types and recognition types, focusing on the perspective of the manner in which things were viewed, i.e., in terms of similarities and dissimilarities. A comparison of the results reveals that blending and nonalignable differences characterize the creative design process.

The incorporation of Y in the nanoscale pseudo-superlattice TiAlCrN/TiAlYN with typical period of 1.7 nm not only improves the oxidation resistance but also effectively reduces the coefficient of friction of the coating from 0.9 to 0.65 at temperatures in the range of 850–950 °C. The adaptation of the tribological properties occurs as a result of the preferential migration of the Y to the column boundaries. TiAlN/VN superlattice can achieve another self-adaptation process. During friction the coatings adapt themselves to the combined thermal and mechanical wear by the formation of highly lubricious vanadium-oxides due to high flash temperatures at the asperity contacts on the surface. The integrity of the bulk of the coating is retained, leading to exceptionally low, for superhard coatings, friction coefficient of 0.5 and a wear coefficient of 2 × 10−17 m3·N−1·m−1.

A questionnaire, focus groups and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data on three cohorts of supervisors and middle managers at different stages of the programme. A triangulated approach was adopted towards data analysis that illuminated a broad and deep change process. Findings – Positive cultural change was a significant benefit to the host organisation from the training programme. It was apparent that training can move beyond individual development to bring about organisational gains. Research limitations/implications – Future research might adopt a longitudinal design and facilitate a co-researcher approach using students’ learning logs of workplace experiences. Practical implications – Situated approaches to learning in higher education and the workplace need to be developed further to enhance workplace performance. A proposal is made for “learning consultants” to move between the two environments and facilitate knowledge exchange and improve understanding of the variety of learning contexts in business and educational settings.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Lynch, R.","Leo, S.","Downing, K."],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.662898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.617042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.599228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.598625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.591498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.588256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.584794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.567843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.563132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.543049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98881,"sim:weight":0.534862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.53353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.531359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.524822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.517888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.513624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.502801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2837,"sim:weight":0.49449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.482916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2820,"sim:weight":0.478594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Underpinning this concern is the continued under representation of BME sex offenders on the Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP).  Although some research has been undertaken into how BME prisoners experience the SOTP and in to its ostensible effectiveness with BME sex offenders, little is known about why the take-up of the SOTP is poor with this group.  In this paper we first consider some specific demographic issues that need to be understood in order to reflect more widely on the BME sex offender in prison.  We then summarise what is currently known about effective practice with this group, thereafter we consider, in turn, current provision for BME sex offenders in England and Wales and suggestions for developing practice with this group of men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nHowever, before we turn to these issues, it is important to consider briefly issues of terminology.  Terminologies in relation to ethnicities and race are fraught with conceptual difficulties.  Aspinall  has highlighted the limitations of ‘pan-ethnic’ groups, such as ‘BME’; such groupings are ‘statistical collectivities’   and ‘the groups thus defined will be nothing more than meaningless statistical collectivities that do not represent any of the constituent groups within the term.’  .  However, at the outset of this paper we use the collective term BME - this term is currently used by a number of Government Departments in the UK, including the Prison Service.  Later we suggest that a more sophisticated understanding of ethnic cultures may be necessary to develop practice with BME sex offenders.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Cowburn, M.","Lavis, V.","Walker, T."],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381999,"sim:weight":0.361312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2862,"sim:weight":0.351629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2884,"sim:weight":0.293782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44868,"sim:weight":0.285593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99441,"sim:weight":0.270681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999497,"sim:weight":0.265641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44378,"sim:weight":0.261654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381933,"sim:weight":0.260986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.260075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.252485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2887,"sim:weight":0.241688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2907,"sim:weight":0.233837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48328,"sim:weight":0.230415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2906,"sim:weight":0.22094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383669,"sim:weight":0.192834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106473,"sim:weight":0.190457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.18763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.187383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.173534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3198,"sim:weight":0.170612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A more punitive penal climate and narrow conception of social exclusion may have created a policy environment that undermines the growth of treatment opportunities now available. The emphasis upon coercion in community justice treatment responses is questioned as it may inadvertently aggravate broader pressures towards custody within the sentencing climate. Since such penal environments aggravate factors associated with social exclusion it is argued that this may undermine rather than enhance individual motivation for change. Research evidence on drug treatment is examined and a case study from probation practice described. The complexities of both suggest that the current policy direction may need to do more to provide treatment when needed and enhance social networks rather than coerce change.

The study starts by evaluating the relevant legislation and case law in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on countryside access and liability in tort for injury suffered by visitors to such places. In doing so it reviews legislation such as Health \u0026amp; Safety at Work Act 1974, Countryside \u0026amp; Rights of Way Act 2000, Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, Occupiers\u0027 Liability Acts 1957 \u0026amp; 1984, Animals Act 1971 and the Compensation Act 2006. Through appraisal of this legislation and key cases such as Tomlinson -v- Congleton Borough Council (2004) the actual level of liability risk is assessed to be low. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe study then investigates the rise of a pervasive discourse amongst policy makers, judiciary and senior business figures asserting the need to avoid further development of a risk adverse culture within the UK and/or to tackle a growth in the perceived \"compensation culture\". A link to deregulation and pro-entrepreneurship interests is shown. The reality of compensation claim rates and associated behaviours is then examined. Issues of liability risk perception are then addressed by reviewing in detail the limited available UK literature on liability perception by landowners and comparing this with evidence from the United States and New Zealand. Case studies of alleged risk adverse land management are then examined to test the evidence base for common assertions of excess regulation and/or withdrawal of access to land or facilities through fear of liability. Finally, the study explores (via interviews of 21 land managers and representative bodies) how liability risks are actually perceived by land owners and the extent of awareness of recent changes in discourse and case law regarding public safety issues. In doing so the study reveals the ways in which land managers in large pro-access agencies and utilities develop common standards and understandings around the level of \"reasonably practicable\" safety provision. The study concludes with recommendations for further research to investigate the way in which liability risk perceptions are formed by smaller landowners who are more remote from such \"interpretive communities\" (Fish 1980).\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Bennett, L.","Crowe, L."],"dc:date":"2008-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100182,"sim:weight":0.522534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100160,"sim:weight":0.48442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158096,"sim:weight":0.452333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100186,"sim:weight":0.436014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100560,"sim:weight":0.42175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.418497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100190,"sim:weight":0.412399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67449,"sim:weight":0.390344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333808,"sim:weight":0.387913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46839,"sim:weight":0.369512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.368423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.356276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.356227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336469,"sim:weight":0.355054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.354456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67448,"sim:weight":0.351506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.349496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100477,"sim:weight":0.349397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100162,"sim:weight":0.346857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.34588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Readily accessible and unguarded metallic elements present in the built environment, such as manhole covers, road signs, church roofs, electricity substations, rail cable, statues, memorial plaques, wiring and piping have all been pillaged, causing major distress, disruption and/or repair expense. This paper describes the relationship between soaring metal prices for copper and lead and economic demand in China and examines the contemporary legal, policy and practical responses to the metal theft phenomenon. Through this analysis the paper shows how metal theft raises some unusual (and uncomfortable) questions about what happens when recycling becomes too successful in terms of its financial attractiveness and the ease of integration of materials back into the materials markets. The paper explains that whilst neither metal theft nor attempts at its regulation are new, the scale of contemporary metal theft calls for a greater focus and co-ordination of asset defence and enforcement action at national policy level.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Bennett, L."],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.330225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104847,"sim:weight":0.320471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.302091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.299472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.295044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.284585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.272659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46839,"sim:weight":0.271313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46838,"sim:weight":0.25353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.247701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383568,"sim:weight":0.244584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46835,"sim:weight":0.234559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46944,"sim:weight":0.227595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46246,"sim:weight":0.22363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2905,"sim:weight":0.21828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381964,"sim:weight":0.213883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.212924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382001,"sim:weight":0.209544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.206366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106765,"sim:weight":0.201066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Act is designed to revise fundamentally the Government of Wales Act 1998. Critics at the time predicted that executive devolution would be unlikely to be stable and would lead to \"catch up\" devolution with more privileged nations such as Scotland. Hence the second phase of Welsh devolution in which a Westminster model of Government is introduced as well as enhanced legislative powers for the National Assembly for Wales, including powers for the Assembly to be given legislative competence by Order in Council to make law in certain of the devolved fields, as an interim stage towards achieving full legislative devolution following a referendum. This paper argues that the Government of Wales Act 2006 has not conclusively settled the constitutional issues of asymmetrical devolution, such as the distribution of power between London and Cardiff; the role of the Secretary of State; the clarity and transparency of Welsh governance; and the question of how long these interim arrangements will last before Wales gains legislative devolution.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, N."],"dc:date":"2008-12-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44495,"sim:weight":0.399767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47601,"sim:weight":0.386093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383442,"sim:weight":0.376275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108752,"sim:weight":0.376169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.365869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109085,"sim:weight":0.350467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84845,"sim:weight":0.348421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76252,"sim:weight":0.347615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104071,"sim:weight":0.345884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381989,"sim:weight":0.335593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99091,"sim:weight":0.335196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99294,"sim:weight":0.332273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46839,"sim:weight":0.320401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930824,"sim:weight":0.316357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108340,"sim:weight":0.313931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.309753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382061,"sim:weight":0.309699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.305703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.305703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.304724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The adoption of this directive represents merely the first stage in the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds falling within its protective remit. The next and arguably most important stage is the implementation of this directive into national law. Of the protected grounds, disability offers what is arguably the greatest challenge for national authorities in the implementation process. It demands flexibility in the legislative approach traditionally used to combat discrimination as well as the introduction of new legal concepts into the national legal order of most Member States. Whilst European Disability Non-Governmental Organisations, together with the European Parliament, are calling on the Commission of the European Union to propose a more expansive directive prohibiting disability discrimination, it is first crucial to ensure that the core aspects of the recently adopted directive are clearly understood and correctly implemented from a disability rights perspective. These core aspects include the definition of disability, the concepts of direct and indirect discrimination, and the duty to provide reasonable accommodations. Given that these core aspects will be common to any disability non-discrimination law, no amount of coverage beyond the context of employment and occupation will compensate for the subsequent loss of opportunity to make a real difference to the lives of disabled people if they are not appropriately addressed.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Whittle, R."],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100180,"sim:weight":0.785671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100203,"sim:weight":0.744352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100188,"sim:weight":0.654456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2883,"sim:weight":0.510687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99091,"sim:weight":0.43304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99332,"sim:weight":0.425372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.384386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.382188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.372148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381989,"sim:weight":0.363859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.354896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98951,"sim:weight":0.345386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2884,"sim:weight":0.34475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.34395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.343944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933572,"sim:weight":0.343944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96261,"sim:weight":0.342884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.341979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352201,"sim:weight":0.335046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269950,"sim:weight":0.328541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The various discourses in corporate governance reflect these assumptions and create four distinct approaches that impact on the relationship between capital and labour. In rejecting the traditional discourse of private enterprise, social enterprises have adopted other approaches to tackle social exclusion, each derived from different underlying beliefs about the purpose of enterprise and the nature of governance.

Recently it has been subject to repeated challenge. A new conception of governance\nthat recognises a plurality of interests, particularly those of employees, has received both theoretical attention and practical examination. This paper examines the connection between liberal and\ncommunitarian philosophy in the recent debate about corporate governance. Empirical evidence from a critical ethnography is used to show how communitarian ideas can influence the governance model of a medium-sized company, and also how social influences constrain and frustrate the application of these ideals. The result is a formal statement of culture built through a process of consultation, and institutionalised in contractual rights and responsibilities. The company leaders have been drawn towards models of control and ownership found in the employee-owned and co-operative sectors. These are perceived to increase participation and involvement, and give voice to more people in the enterprise. During debate and discussion, however, the management group reduced the powers initially proposed for the governing body, and empirical data suggests this was\npartly to win support from those sceptical about the proposals, partly to protect decision-making powers, and partly to protect the company from the inexperience of non-executives.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Ridley-Duff, R."],"dc:date":"2004-07-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100437,"sim:weight":0.746172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100212,"sim:weight":0.614206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100214,"sim:weight":0.544282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100219,"sim:weight":0.463286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.453749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100217,"sim:weight":0.449523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.449019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.423949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.417339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.41501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.414416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.401098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.400346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46762,"sim:weight":0.384205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.380836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.374612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46507,"sim:weight":0.373492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352201,"sim:weight":0.357572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.351385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98991,"sim:weight":0.346639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A brief review of the academic and practitioner literature highlights a number of benefits associated with exporting that include exposure to differing ways of ‘how to do’ business and opportunities for the development of joint ventures and strategic alliances.  However, several regions within the United Kingdom perceive that they have too few SMEs who trade internationally.  Recent estimates suggest that approximately three per cent of the SMEs in the United Kingdom are actively exporting (Bank of England, 1999).  Government policy makers have responded to such concerns by providing a range of support programmes to increase the number of SMEs who trade internationally and enhance the skills and capabilities of those SMEs who export, so that they can efficiently and effectively manage the exporting and market development process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, in the majority of the English regions, there are a range of publicly funded organisations providing advice, consultancy, information and training to SMEs wishing to trade internationally and those businesses already exporting.  In addition, SMEs can access a number of export services from private sector organisations such as banks, accountants, freight forwarders and export agents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere has been no overall national ‘stocktake’ or audit of such provision.  However, the need for such a stocktake is becoming increasingly important due to the introduction of a number of new support organisations into the institutional landscape and the re-organisation and re-branding of British Trade International as Trade Partners UK and the appointment of a series of Regional International Trade Directors.  The introduction of the Small Business Service will have a major impact on the coverage and nature of provision for exporting SMEs within each of the English regions.  The introduction of the Small Business Service, however, provides an opportunity to explore and examine alternative configurations of small business support and the types of organisation that are best placed to satisfy the needs of exporting SMEs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis paper presents the key findings to emerge from an audit of export services within each of the English regions.

The paper shifts the lens away from numbers to consider how actors see themselves as social enterprises. The authors make sense of the foundations upon which the concept of social enterprise and entrepreneurship is ‘drawn’ – quite literally – by considering linear models and diagrams that analyse social enterprise on a continuum between non-profit (mission) and profit (market) orientation.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA great deal has been made of the success and growth of social enterprise. The imagery in the literature reflects an emphasis on growth resulting from ‘the rising tide of commercialisation of non-profit organisations’ (Dees, 1998) with the result that the CBI now includes over 50,000 organisations in a social enterprise sector (SBS, 2005). Despite reports of rapid growth, there is awareness that ‘take-up of social enterprise model … is patchy and fails to reflect the enthusiasm with which it is discussed’ (Stevenson in Westall \u0026amp; Chalkley 2007). We ask why?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA methodological approach involving visual drawings by actors reveals stories and sensemaking experiences of social enterprises. Open conversations enabled the researchers to gain deep insights that would not have been as insightful through a quantitative approach.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe key findings suggest: Firstly, participants report tensions when pursuing social and economic goals simultaneously. Secondly, whilst some welcome opportunities that are emerging, others perceive substantive threats to the third sector. Thirdly, Social enterprise emerges as a diverse and heterogeneous movement located at the boundaries of public, private and voluntary sectors. At each boundary, different constitutional forms and practices are seen.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, it is argued that the linear perspective itself gives the impression that there is a ‘patchy’ take up of social enterprise. A heterogeneous perspective reveals that theory and policy development is patchy, rather than social enterprise practices.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe unique contribution this research paper offers is within the depth of enquiry and insight into the actual practices provided from those within the field.

A focus on the economic implies a business model where deep tensions lie. A focus on social capital offers a different frame of reference, yet both these conceptualisations fail to fully identify the phenomena that is social enterprise. The objective of this paper seeks to fill that gap. Ethical capital is offered here as the missing conceptualisation in the field of social enterprise.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nPrior work: Pearce (2003) describes social enterprises as part of the third system, closer to the first system (private business), than the second system (public provision), yet primarily social and secondly a business. Social Enterprises are described as trading organisations in a market (Pearce 2003). A focus and operationalisation for social enterprises to be ‘business-like’ and ‘entrepreneurial’ is well documented (Leadbeater 1997; Dees 1998; Nicholls 2006b).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nApproach: Yet, if as part of the third sector, social enterprises are as Dart (2004) suggests; ‘blurring the boundaries between non-profit and profit’, but what blurs? What is compromised? What exactly is lost (or gained)? What challenges are there for social enterprises? And is a managerialist ideology taking precedence over the social? This paper provides a conceptual paper that seeks to outline the arguments on the table and develop an ethical capital conceptualisation of social enterprise.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nResults: This paper very much aims at starting the process of intellectual debate about the notion of ethical capital in social enterprises. The conclusions of this paper outline further research questions that need to be addressed in order to fully develop this concept. Implications: The current ideology of the neo-classical economic paradigm it is argued in the paper pursues interests towards the self and towards the erosion of the moral basis of association. The outcome leaves society with a problem of low ethical virtue - the implications of this paper are that social enterprises maximise ethical virtue beyond any other form of organisation and as such hold great value beyond their missions and values.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nValue: This paper offers great value in the understanding of social enterprise through fresh insight into the conceptualisation.

Particular emphasis is currently being given to two types of middle-class neighbourhood; gentrified urban neighbourhoods of ‘distinction’ and inconspicuous ‘suburban landscapes of privilege’. However, there has been a dearth of work on ‘marginal’ middle-class neighbourhoods that are similarly ‘inconspicuous’ rather than distinctive, but less exclusive, thus containing sources of ‘spoiled identity’. This article draws on data gathered from two ‘marginal’ middleclass neighbourhoods that contained a particular source of ‘spoiled identity’: social renters. Urban sociological analyses of neighbour responses to these situations highlight a process of dis-identification with the maligned object, which exacerbates neighbour differences. Our analysis of data from the ‘marginal’ middle-class neighbourhoods suggests something entirely different and Goffmanesque.

Here, we consider the case of hybrid films, where one of the substrates induces strongly homeotropic anchoring while the other favours either weakly homeotropic or planar anchoring. These systems are investigated using both Monte Carlo simulation and density-functional theory, the latter implemented at the level of Onsager’s second virial approximation with Parsons-Lee rescaling. The orientational structure is found to change either continuously or discontinuously depending on substrate separation, in agreement with earlier predictions by others. Theory is seen to perform well in spite of its simplicity, predicting the positional and orientational structure seen in simulations even for small particle elongations.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Teixeira, P.

The research aims to identify what the key factors are that influence patients\u0027 perceptions of cleanliness and to rank these factors in order of importance.  Design/methodology/approach – The project utilised a mixed methodology to collect the data. The hospital staff and people who had been recent patients took part in focus groups in order to gather their views. The current hospital in-patients were surveyed through the use of a paper questionnaire.  Findings – The main themes that influence the perceptions of cleanliness emerging from the analysis can be summarised under three broad headings – appearance of the environment, physical cleanliness and staff behaviour. The findings suggest that this subject is much more complex than the production of a list. The appearance of the environment is a complex set of perceptions based on what individuals believe to be important, what they observe and what they expect.

As well as introducing a standardised pay structure; it also aims to improve recruitment, retention and staff morale. Staff groups identified as having recruitment and retention problems include estates/works officers, qualified maintenance crafts persons and qualified maintenance technicians. The object of this research was to investigate recruitment and retention problems for estates and facilities staff currently experienced by Trusts.  Design/methodology/approach – Focus groups were used as the primary method of data collection in an attempt to tap into the existing expertise of staff working at strategic and operational supervisory positions in a wide range of Trusts.  Findings – Although our findings suggest that the main recruitment and retention issues fall into four main themes: social, financial, environmental and political; recruitment and retention of estates and facilities management staff is a complex problem involving a wide range of issues and these can vary from location to location. Furthermore this should also be seen as a series of issues that varies across employment groups including: domestic/housekeeping, trades, managers/officers and facilities directors, which need to be distinguished.  Practical implications – There is a continuing need to raise the profile of estates and facilities management staff in the NHS to those levels enjoyed by Human Resource (HR) and Financial Management. Furthermore perceptions surrounding both recruitment and retention issues and the nature of work within estates and facilities management staff in the NHS can lead to a negative and self-perpetuating “cycle of failure” where there is an assumption of loss of control. However, there are some initiatives being undertaken that suggest it is possible to concentrate on internal matters such as more appropriate and flexible recruitment processes, improved support services for staff and greater flexibility within the job and that these can generate “cycles of success”.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["May, D.","Askham, P."],"dc:date":"2005-01-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929843,"sim:weight":0.509093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67072,"sim:weight":0.464422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67073,"sim:weight":0.430325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45264,"sim:weight":0.380819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.366537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381995,"sim:weight":0.359471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.356644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.355447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.349997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.343083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.341438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.323322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.322663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46709,"sim:weight":0.315207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3198,"sim:weight":0.309418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5941,"sim:weight":0.305001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.301015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.299817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382009,"sim:weight":0.290398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48298,"sim:weight":0.288251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Four groups of students, aged 14 to 15 years old, from a secondary school in the United Kingdom (UK) participated in the study. The students involved in the programme took the role of researchers investigating their peers’ perceptions of climate change using video to visually record their findings. University researchers worked collaboratively with the school students and a teacher from the school through an approach that empowered the students within the research process. Drawing from the ideas and issues raised from an initial briefing session, each group of students developed a short interview schedule to be used whilst investigating the views of their peers. Although the project was on a small scale, the data gathered from the brainstorming activity, video reports and reflective discussions provided a useful snap shot of how the participating students perceived their experience and the nature of their involvement in the research process. The research approach enabled students to take on the role of investigator when interviewing their peers and to offer a voice for both themselves and their peers.

Ultimately, through exploring objects\u0027 affordances, our relationship to them develops into a routinised practice we no longer reflect on them. Hair care is universal and (often) an ‘ordinary’ part of our daily routines. Our cleanliness routines consume resources and therefore are implicated in the issue of environmental sustainability. However, routines are complex and\ndifficult to change when they are set in a culture of individual consumer choice. The disorder inherent in the process of appropriation raises the possibility that design might deliberately create a useful ‘disorder’ in routinised practices to facilitate sustainable strategies in everyday life.\n  The paper proposes an approach of investigating routinised practices in relation to deliberately creating disorder in everyday routines and practice theory. Further, it outlines a pilot study that uses the designled method of \u0027probes\u0027 and considers its potentials in generating disorder. It identifies creative disorder in the process of designers developing the probes, participants interacting with them to finally designers receiving the results. Thinking about the process in terms of disorder is seen to be valuable in facilitating, applying and\ndeveloping probes, not only to inspire the designer but also to sensitise the designer to private and intimate areas of everyday life such as hair care.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Hielscher, S.","Fisher, T.","Cooper, T."],"dc:date":"2007-04-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.427344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.350777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.346044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.329129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.311805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.297958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.294677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.281653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.262792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.261481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16699,"sim:weight":0.241113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.235204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2865,"sim:weight":0.184822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16761,"sim:weight":0.180075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2916,"sim:weight":0.179335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46611,"sim:weight":0.174033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2862,"sim:weight":0.167152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103718,"sim:weight":0.0673647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Accompanying this has been a good deal of interest in ways to employ their professional and creative practices as instruments of inquiry, just as previous disciplines have developed research methods that employ their specialist skills and knowledge. This raises questions about how research in the creative disciplines might contribute to knowledge and understanding. Research and practice in these fields may deal with matter that changes meaning with time or context, especially in art, where audiences may be expected to complete the meaning of creative works for themselves. This paper offers an oversight of these issues. It sets out some examples from the wider community that illustrate how incomplete or tacit contributions to inquiry can be a valuable and sometimes necessary part of the enterprise of creating knowledge, establishing a research model that is relevant in many areas, especially where disciplines collaborate. It goes on to set out tentative principles for such contributions.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Rust, C."],"dc:date":"2007-12-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.553506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.548181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.542426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.518411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.503626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.490391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.48454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.463529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312663,"sim:weight":0.461534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.459031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.447708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.447062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.444507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88939,"sim:weight":0.44051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.439776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.430328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.424418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.424418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.421219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.404122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The electrical activity of\r\ndefects in as-implanted Er, Si, and Yb doped Si has been studied by Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DTLS) and the related, high resolution technique, Laplace DLTS (LDLTS), as a function of annealing. Er-implanted Si, regrown by solid phase epitaxy at 600degrees C and then subject to a rapid thermal anneal, has also been studied by time-resolved photoluminescence (PL). The LDLTS studies reveal that there are clear differences in the defect population as a function of depth from the surface, and this is attributed to different defects in the vacancy-rich and interstitial-rich regions. Defects in the interstitial-rich region have electrical characteristics typical of small extended defects, and these may provide the precursors for larger structural defects in annealed layers. The time-resolved PL of the annealed layers, in combination with electron microscopy, shows that the Er emission at 1.54microns contains a fast component attributed to non-radiative recombination at deep states due to small dislocations. It is concluded that there can be measurable competition to the radiative efficiency in rare-earth implanted Si that is due to the implantation and is not specific to Er.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Evans-Freeman, J.

The challenge to conventional wisdom matches that posed by ‘Lean Production’ to ‘Mass\r\nManufacturing’. Data envelope analysis examined the income generated and patient-occupied area as\r\noutputs from the gross area of a NHS Trust’s estate. The approach yielded strategic comparisons that\r\nconventional facilities management measures of cost per square metre hide. The annual cost of an excess\r\nestate is conservatively estimated at £600,000,000 (in England alone). Further research to understand the\r\ncauses of the excess is needed. Meanwhile the research illustrates the power of an alternative way of\r\nassessing facilities performance. The authors are not aware of the lean asset perspective previously being\r\napplied to health-care facilities. The research shows the underlying fallacy of relying on cost per square\r\nmetre as the primary measure of asset performance. The results and discussion will be particularly useful\r\nto senior estates and facilities managers wishing to use new measures to define strategic estates targets.","bibo:AuthorList":["May, D.","Price, I."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929843,"sim:weight":0.485181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.370378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.368546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.352941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.342901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.339541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3198,"sim:weight":0.322458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.304218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.302718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46163,"sim:weight":0.300101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.285368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.266025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.265386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5941,"sim:weight":0.248129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.246021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.245595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.242137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.240538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.233276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.232952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In addition, there is little understanding of how shallow their information seeking behaviours actually are.  This causes difficulties in their academic studies and in their professional lives. Further research suggested that an active learning approach would be the most appropriate for this initiative. \r\n\r\nTechnological limitations imposed by the teaching space and time constraints imposed by the faculty led the O\u0026M Library team to develop an initiative that comprised a modular, practical, active learning approach that could be delivered by any academic librarian, regardless of subject speciality, in any teaching space. This article details the initiative and its components, particularly the modular activities, including a Google based icebreaker, an information behaviour typology using animals, and examples of different types of business information.  It also shares the positive feedback from lecturers and students and describes possible enhancements that the team will include in the next iteration of this programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Borg, M.","Stretton, E."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.521643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.458377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.447529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.444774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67048,"sim:weight":0.4409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.438174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.437933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.428242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.415779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.404965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.390762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13201,"sim:weight":0.388409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41233,"sim:weight":0.376587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.368447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3216,"sim:weight":0.356041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3172,"sim:weight":0.343842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.335057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.330095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.298692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.297833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This discussion presents a range of data which aims to highlight weaknesses in the widespread application of the \u0027risk society\u0027 thesis (Beck 1992). This paper uses the lives of young people as a context specific example. This selection of quantitative and qualitative data, taken from a school-based case study, is juxtaposed against theoretical reasoning throughout this paper. Three main assumptions made by the \u0027risk society\u0027 thesis are critiqued using this empirical data: (1) risk is a negative concept, (2) risk is aligned with uncertainty and worry, and (3) those living in the \u0027risk society\u0027 have become sceptical of expert opinions. The conclusion suggests that by using pockets of mixed methodology the extensive acceptance of the \u0027risk society\u0027 thesis can be critiqued. By stimulating this debate it becomes clear that each of the individual criticisms need further research. This paper provides a platform for future empirical work which would look to strengthen the social constructionist framework involved in an appreciation of risk, moving away from the recent trend in grand risk theorising, to context specific data collection and explanation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Austen, L."],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85193,"sim:weight":0.481052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.480461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.453556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.447586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383630,"sim:weight":0.415467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98868,"sim:weight":0.411904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48326,"sim:weight":0.400933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.394582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109179,"sim:weight":0.389974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387392,"sim:weight":0.379373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.366124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.364827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382095,"sim:weight":0.363555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.360376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.357332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44378,"sim:weight":0.356785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.356586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383655,"sim:weight":0.35645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.33647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.315361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Individuals with avoidant personality disorder (APD), however, are theoretically less responsive to context or situational cues because of the inflexible nature of their personality disposition. This idea of individual differences in context-responsiveness was tested in a sample of 169 undergraduates who were assessed for APD features and assigned to positive, negative, or neutral attachment priming conditions. More pronounced APD features were associated with more negative responses to vignettes describing potentially distressing social situations. A significant interaction showed that participants with more avoidant features consistently appraised the vignettes relatively more negatively, regardless of priming condition. Those without APD features, by contrast, did not exhibit negative appraisals/evaluations unless negatively primed (curvilinear effect). This effect could not be explained by depression, current mood, or attachment insecurity, all of which related to negative evaluative biases, but none of which related to situation inflexibility. These findings provide empirical support for the notion that negative information-processing is unusually inflexible and context-unresponsive among individuals with more pronounced features of APD.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bowles, D.

The solar cell characteristics are predicted by a simulation model that shows how the morphology influences device performance through integration of all the processes occurring in organic photocells in a specified morphology. In bicontinuous phases, the surface de. ning the interface between the electron and hole transporting phases divides the volume into two disjoint subvolumes. Exciton loss is reduced because the interface at which charge separation occurs permeates the device so excitons have only a short distance to reach the interface. As each of the component phases is connected, charges will be able to reach the electrodes more easily. In simulations of the current-voltage characteristics of organic cells with gyroid, disordered blend and vertical rod (rods normal to the electrodes) morphologies, we find that gyroids have a lower than anticipated performance advantage over disordered blends, and that vertical rods are superior. These results are explored thoroughly, with geminate recombination, i.e. recombination of charges originating from the same exciton, identified as the primary source of loss. Thus, if an appropriate materials choice could reduce geminate recombination, gyroids show great promise for future research and applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kimber,  R. G. E.","Walker,  A.

This is evident both in the professional arena  and at amateur level.  Within the sport of rugby union, two recent decisions from the English Court of Appeal concerning the liability of referees have caused a certain amount of unease among competitors, referees and sports enthusiasts alike.  It is against this background that one should view with interest the latest decision emanating from the Court of Appeal regarding liability for injuries caused on the rugby field. In Mountford v Newlands School [2007] EWCA Civ 21 a schoolmaster in charge of the opposing team was held liable, and his employer school vicariously so, for the injuries caused to a 14-year-old schoolboy who was tackled legally by an opposition player who was over the age of 15 at the time and therefore ineligible to play in the match under the England Rugby Football Schools’ Union (ERFSU) guidelines. The ruling has implications for youth rugby at all levels, in particular inter-school and college competitions. This is because an overly restrictive view of the ERFSU guidelines, coupled with the difficulties associated with the “school-year”, makes it difficult for certain juniors to play within their allotted age-group. This article criticises the Court of Appeal’s overly restrictive interpretation of the ERFSU guidelines. First, it explores the rationale for imposing liability and analyses the legal questions pertaining to the breach of duty. Second, the article explores the complex question of causation inherent in the case. The article concludes by discussing the legal status of guidelines in sport and highlights the potential public policy implications of this ruling on youth sport at all levels, with a particular emphasis on junior rugby. While the article deals predominantly with a problem which arose in England as a result of legal construal of the ERFSU guidelines, the issues raised are nonetheless capable of application to all sports, in England, Australia or elsewhere.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heywood, R.","Charlish, P."],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1352228,"sim:weight":0.495558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.410033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.406791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382063,"sim:weight":0.363409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2890,"sim:weight":0.362665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381989,"sim:weight":0.344531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15201,"sim:weight":0.344128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383426,"sim:weight":0.34353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.342369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352209,"sim:weight":0.336871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.336573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352201,"sim:weight":0.333261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45050,"sim:weight":0.326263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.326254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.315388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46838,"sim:weight":0.312597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46773,"sim:weight":0.305353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3200,"sim:weight":0.303626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999701,"sim:weight":0.297307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.296647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The large dimensions together with the development of dense smoke that drastically reduces visibility, represent major challenges. The Guardians robot swarm is designed to assist re ghters in searching a\r\nlarge warehouse. In this paper we discuss the technology developed for a swarm of robots assisting re ghters. We explain the swarming algorithms which provide the functionality by which the robots react to and follow humans while no communication is required. Next we discuss the wireless communication system, which is a so-called mobile ad-hoc network. The communication network provides also the means to locate the robots and humans. Thus the robot swarm is able to provide guidance information to the humans. Together with the fire fighters we explored how\r\nthe robot swarm should feed information back to the human fire fighter. We have designed and experimented with interfaces for presenting swarm based information to human beings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Penders, Jacques","Alboul, L.","Witkowski, U.","Naghsh, A.","Saez-Pons, J.","Herbrechtsmeier, S.","El-Habbal, M."],"dc:date":"2009-11-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":11052,"sim:weight":0.821433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112424,"sim:weight":0.786121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100478,"sim:weight":0.471648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9553862,"sim:weight":0.393011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9553864,"sim:weight":0.338871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59223,"sim:weight":0.326338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.313789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.311939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26670,"sim:weight":0.31185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100397,"sim:weight":0.305362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.304356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336542,"sim:weight":0.259681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999902,"sim:weight":0.258764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9256707,"sim:weight":0.228561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26739,"sim:weight":0.200395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.190635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338182,"sim:weight":0.152952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337320,"sim:weight":0.150051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334031,"sim:weight":0.113969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337241,"sim:weight":0.111727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Motivated by an interest in using new technologies in the context of formal learning (Merchant, 2009), I draw on in-school and out-of-school work in Web 2.0 spaces. This work is inflected by the new literacies approach (Lankshear and Knobel, 2006a), and here I provide an overview of the ways in which learning through participation is characterised by those adopting this and other related perspectives. I include a critical examination of the idea of ‘participatory’ culture as articulated in the field of media studies, focusing particularly on the influential work of Jenkins (2006a; 2006b). In order to draw these threads together around conceptualizations of learning, I summarise ways in which participation is described in the literature on socially-situated cognition. This is used to generate some tentative suggestions about how learning and literacy in Web 2.0 spaces might be envisioned and how ideas about participation might inform curriculum planning and design.","bibo:AuthorList":["Merchant, G.

In this paper, we employed the combined methods of cross-sectional ion beam milling sample preparation, conventional transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and quantitative spectrum analysis to give a comprehensive characterization of wear induced tribofilm, worn TiAIN/VN surface as well as wear debris. The major wear mechanism operating in the TiAIN/VN coating is the tribo-oxidation wear. A 20-50 nm thick tribofilm was observed on the TiAIN/VN worn surface, having inhomogeneous density, amorphous structure and multicomponent V-Al-Ti-O composition. Therefore the real sliding contact during the ball-on-disk test was a three-body sliding system including the tribofilm, in which the self-sintering and shearing deformation of the multicomponent oxide film played a significant role in determining the low friction coefficient. Owing to the low friction and high hardness, the TiAIN/VN worn surface retained good structural integrity without any crack, delamination or detectable deformation, resulting in minimized mechanical wear.

The counternarrative, found in recent work in new litearcies (Lankshear \u0026 Knobel, 2006) provides an attractive alternative, but a movement in this direction requires a fundamental shift of emphasis and a re-conceptualisation of what counts as learning.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cb\u003eConclusions:\u003c/b\u003e This work on 3D virtual worlds questions the notion of how transformative practice can be achieved with the use of new technologies.

Drawing from a small-scale interview study of students’ digital practices, this paper explores how different discourses may have patterned a group of students’ experiences of VLEs. Unlike studies which have focused upon evaluations of specific projects or interventions, this study investigated their experience across their course. It explores the student identities they associated with digital environments and the power relationships which seemed to pattern how they positioned themselves (or felt positioned) as learners. Whilst none were intimidated by technical aspects, the student identities available to them seemed to vary, as did their perceptions of the student identities associated with university-sponsored digital environments. The analysis considers three aspects of their experience:  how they related to the VLE itself, how they related to others through this, and the alternative communities they created to attempt to manage their engagement with the VLE. The paper concludes by arguing for further research which focuses on the broader student experience across courses in order to explore how university-based digital environments intersect with students’ identities as learners.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burnett, C."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.612416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.567243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.563317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.547005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.53811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99108,"sim:weight":0.529007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.520007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48316,"sim:weight":0.518741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4355,"sim:weight":0.510177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.508964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.497871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106355,"sim:weight":0.467497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16699,"sim:weight":0.464529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.455331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.45289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.450397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.450278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.447414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.437604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3203,"sim:weight":0.428922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Data from two different client-contractor relationship situations was collected utilising a critical ethnographic research methodology; a phenomenological paradigm that acknowledges knowledge as socially constructed through language.

Participants communicate objects called ‘positions’ and ‘intentions’ and share their ‘doubts’ about each others’ declarations.  On the basis of this ‘communicated common knowledge’ those involved, seeking to act rationally, normally experience dilemmas.  These prompt them to devise frame-breaking changes that alter the form of the interaction, perhaps placing additional pressure upon some parties whilst relieving that experienced by others.  At some point these changes cease and the participants play their actions, possibly using game theory to inform their individual strategies.  Within this context, this paper explores the process of dilemma elimination, specifically seeing whether there may be favourable sequences that could be adopted: these would show a commander the most beneficial route for advantageously resolving confrontations with other parties.  Such sequences would both reduce or eliminate the commander’s own dilemmas, whilst aggravating or otherwise engineering those facing other parties so as to render them more compliant.  The paper uses a new version of drama theory (DT2) that offers a simpler but no less powerful formulation of the dilemmas which has as yet not been widely applied in any field.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bryant, J.

This review examines the kinds of understandings that have been generated through studies of primary literacy and technology reported during the period 2000-2006. It uses Green’s distinction between ‘operational’, ‘cultural’ and ‘critical’ dimensions of primary literacy (Lankshear and Bigum, 1999; Snyder, 2001) to investigate the focus and methodology of 38 empirical studies. It explores ways in which research may be informed by assumptions and practices associated with print literacy, but also highlights the kinds of studies which are beginning to investigate the implications of digital texts for primary education. The paper concludes by arguing for further ethnographic and phenomenological studies of classroom literacy practices in order to explore the complex contexts which surround and are mediated by digital texts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burnett, C."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":3218,"sim:weight":0.696694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309627,"sim:weight":0.415626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387409,"sim:weight":0.396428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.359423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.357242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.345018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.343481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48418,"sim:weight":0.336735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.335437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.32569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.325002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.322643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.312979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.309531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.30396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.289343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.269989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.26588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.261221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.251586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using the underrepresentation of Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) prisoners in accredited offending behaviour related prison programmes as a case study to explore understandings of race relations, the paper reflects on whether the under representation indicates the operation of racial discrimination by prison staff or a refusal to participate by prisoners. It also explores other explanations for this phenomenon relating to the enactment of positive ethnic identities and resistance to programmes that ignore such identities. The paper concludes by considering the challenge of developing an active prison culture that validates all ethnic identities in culturally appropriate ways.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cowburn, M.","Lavis, V."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2862,"sim:weight":0.619468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109025,"sim:weight":0.602951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108022,"sim:weight":0.574111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75528,"sim:weight":0.47665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.37232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18100,"sim:weight":0.339888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2887,"sim:weight":0.326475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77960,"sim:weight":0.318594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2884,"sim:weight":0.313978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.29998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.289748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.289748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335198,"sim:weight":0.286621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.284124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88951,"sim:weight":0.274836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383560,"sim:weight":0.262263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.255111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99441,"sim:weight":0.247292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.23812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.237797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Interview findings informed the development of a questionnaire which was sent to 1000 women (\u003e70) to quantify their views regarding screening.  \r\n\r\nResults: Twenty-six women were interviewed and a questionnaire designed.  The questionnaire response rate was 48.3% (479/992). Over half (52.9%, 241/456) of respondents were unaware they could request mammography by voluntary self-referral and were unaware of how to arrange this. Most (81.5%  383/470) had not attended breast screening since turning 70. Most (75.6%, 343/454) felt screening was beneficial and would attend if invited. Most, (90.1%, 412/457) felt screening should be offered to all women regardless of age or health. \r\nConclusions: There is  a lack of knowledge about screening in older women.

{"identifier":100418,"ep:Repository":102,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Understanding deviant lifestyles: critically evaluating anti-social behaviour and problem drug use","bibo:abstract":"In recent years, politicians across the United Kingdom have become increasingly preoccupied with the social management of anti-social individuals and groups. Translating governmental strategies and policies in to action at street level requires an understanding of the mechanics of deviant lifestyles and the ways in which lifestyle choices increase the amount of contact that individuals have with the police and other crime control agencies. The subjective nature of terms such as ‘anti-social behaviour’ (ASB), ‘problem drug use’ and ‘deviant lifestyles’ makes it particularly difficult to generate valid data concerning their prevalence or otherwise and presents challenges for methodological approaches. In part, this is due to the governmental drive to regulate and control groups of generally young people without a clear evidence base for these actions. This political strategy bypasses the complexities inherent in understanding ASB and, more broadly, what are perceived to be deviant lifestyles. \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003eIn order to make sense of the extent of ASB it is essential to create a critical understanding of how different groups of people define both anti- and pro-social behaviour. In particular, these include the different perspectives of victims of crime, offenders, people who live in different communities and those who have different life experiences. It would also take account of gender, generational and class differences.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e Through police case file analysis and interviews it has been possible to investigate how different categories of people who come into contact with the criminal justice system understand ASB and deviant lifestyles, particularly in relation to offenders and victims. By using methodology in a more creative way it is possible to develop a greater understanding of what ASB means to different groups of people. These methodological approaches highlight the fluid nature of victim and offender groups and the importance of subjectivity in understanding terms such as ‘anti-social behaviour’, ‘problem drug use’ and ‘deviant lifestyles’.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003eQuestions still remain concerning what acts constitute ASB and, because of this, this article asks whether there are any similarities between ASB discourse and previous debates about deviance. These debates are illuminated by two recent research studies concerning the policing of ASB and an evaluation of drug lifestyles, both conducted in the Chiltern Vale police area. These examples provide a critical appreciation of two distinct forms of deviant lifestyle that are often misunderstood in the public arena. A bottom-up focus moves the emphasis of the study away from official statistics and instead provides a more holistic vision of community safety issues that emphasises the lived reality of deviant lifestyles. These findings have direct implications for national initiatives concerning the use of ASB legislation and the development of effective harm reduction strategies for drug users.

It presents research findings from the formal literature, from agency codes of practice, from telephone interviews with regulatory and professional bodies and from an exercise using ‘snowballing techniques’ in which informants responded to brief scenarios illustrating boundary dilemmas. The findings suggest that formal research plays little part in the guidance that individuals use to help them determine professional boundaries. Similarly, only 10–15 per cent of informants made regular reference to regulatory and professional codes of practice, with an even smaller percentage quoting specific sections from these codes. A slightly larger group (15–20 per cent) made fairly regular reference to their agency\u0027s policy documents. However, a clear majority relied on their own sense of what is appropriate or inappropriate, and made their judgements with no reference to any formal guidance. Agency guidance tended to ignore the ambiguous areas of practice and seemed to act as an insurance policy, brought out and dusted off when something goes awry. The authors caution against ever-increasing bullet points of advice and prescription, and advance a notion of ethical engagement in which professionals exercise their ethical senses through regular discussion of professional boundary dilemmas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Doel, M.","Allmark, P.

The review returned three types of article: general discussion, issues in particular studies, and studies of interview-based research ethics. Whilst many of the issues discussed in these articles are generic to research ethics, such as confidentiality, they often had particular manifestations in this type of research. For example, privacy was a significant problem as interviews sometimes probe unexpected areas. For similar reasons, it is difficult to give full information of the nature of a particular interview at the outset, hence informed consent is problematic. Where a pair is interviewed (such as carer and cared-for) there are major difficulties in maintaining confidentiality and protecting privacy. The potential for interviews to harm participants emotionally is noted in some papers, although this is often set against potential therapeutic benefit. As well as these generic issues, there are some ethical issues fairly specific to in-depth interviews. The problem of dual role is noted in many papers. It can take many forms: an interviewer might be nurse and researcher, scientist and counsellor, or reporter and evangelist. There are other specific issues such as taking sides in an interview, and protecting vulnerable groups. Little specific study of the ethics of in-depth interviews has taken place. However, that which has shows some important findings. For example, one study shows participants are not averse to discussing painful issues provided they feel the study is worthwhile. Some papers make recommendations for researchers. One such is that they should consider using a model of continuous (or process) consent rather than viewing consent as occurring once, at signature, prior to the interview. However, there is a need for further study of this area, both philosophical and empirical.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allmark, P.

It is seen as a barrier to public health when the public disbelieves or fails to act on public health messages. Two elements to lay epidemiology are proposed: (a) empirical beliefs about the nature of illness and (b) values about the place of health and risks to health in a good life. Both elements have to be dealt with by effective public health schemes or programmes, which would attempt to change the public\u0027s empirical beliefs and values. This is of concern, particularly in a context in which the lay voice is increasingly respected. Empirically, the scientific voice of standard epidemiology should be deferred to by the lay voice, provided a clear distinction exists between the measurement of risk, which is empirical, and its weighting, which is based on values. Turning to engagement with values, health is viewed to be an important value and is discussed and reflected on by most people. Public health professionals are therefore entitled and advised to participate in that process. This view is defended against some potential criticisms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allmark, P.

The response to this needs to be more sophisticated than simply ensuring minorities are present in samples. For quantitative research looking primarily at treatment effects of drugs and devices four suggestions are made. First, identify where the representation of minorities in samples matters - for example, where ethnicity may cause different treatment effects. Second, where the representation of a particular group matters then subgroup analysis of the results will usually be necessary. Third, ensuring representation and subgroup analysis will have costs; deciding on whether such representation is worthwhile will involve cost benefit analysis. Fourth, the representation of minorities should not be seen as mainly a locality issue. For qualitative research it is argued that the representation of diversity is often important. Given the small samples of many qualitative projects, however, the best way to ensure representation occurs is to allow a proliferation of such research, not to stipulate such representation in samples.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allmark, P.

In three years, the CRP has succeeded in nurturing a climate of sustainable consumer involvement within the NTCRN and this has become embedded in the culture of the network. Furthermore, the panel have championed a sustainable development of consumer involvement in health and social care research by testing new ground and forging a new way of working between health professionals and patients and carers. The CRP model has been held up as an example to other cancer networks, with new panels being set up around the country to emulate its success.  This paper describes the Sheffield model of patient and public involvement and using the eight key principles of successful consumer involvement in research, identified in a recent paper by Telford et al (2003), provides a useful framework for analysing the work of the Panel. This demonstrates how consumers and professionals can inform each other to work constructively and synergistically to achieve impressive research results.  The need for measurable outcomes to assess the impact and effect of consumer involvement is finally explored.","bibo:AuthorList":["Collins, K.","Stevens, T.","Ahmedzai , S.

However, while Aluminium alloys are highly resistant to uniform (general) corrosion, they are much more susceptible to types of localised corrosion, especially intergranular corrosion, which is a localised attack along the grain boundaries which leaves the grains themselves largely unaffected. In order to estimate the progress of such corrosion in a given sample, it is considered possible to generate a numerical model of some sort. While there has been much effort spent in the development of electrochemistry-based models, the use of grey and black-box models remains largely unexplored. One exception to this is the use of Cellular Automata (CA) models which have recently been exploited to model the progression of uniform corrosion. The object of the current paper is to apply the CA methodology to the case of intergranular corrosion.

In this paper, the core assumptions of communitarian philosophy and values are outlined, together with the way writers imagine these might be enacted in a social enterprise context. These assumptions are then explored using two case studies. \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\nDesign/Methodology: The study was conducted using participatory action research which involves parties examining current actions together and seeking to improve on them. The value of this approach is based on the plausible, authentic and critical insights it generates into management practice.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\nFindings: Case evidence suggests that companies are able to adopt and operate effectively while deploying communitarian values, and that these values lead to alternative business objectives expressed through new forms of corporate governance.

However, describing and understanding ethnic diversity, and associated disadvantage, is far from straightforward. In practice, the ethical and scientific arguments around whether and how to incorporate ethnicity into policy-relevant social research are complex and contentious. In particular, untheorised or insensitive inclusion of data on ethnic \u0027groups\u0027 can have negative consequences. The present investigation begins to explore the extent to which social scientists have access to advice and guidance in this area of research. Specifically, the paper examines how ethnic diversity is explicitly or implicitly considered within the research ethics and scientific standard guidance provided by UK social science Learned Societies to their members. The review found little in the way of explicit attention to ethnic diversity in the guidance documents, but nevertheless identified a number of pertinent themes. The paper compiles and extrapolates these themes to present a tentative set of principles for social scientists to debate and further develop.","bibo:AuthorList":["Salway, S.","Allmark, P.

The paper details how the complex professional relationship of educational practitioner research, and the associated ethical issues, together with the variety of data analysed influenced the approach taken. The paper explores how the adaptations to constructed grounded theory process were applied and how this approach can be construed as grounded in grounded theory. \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\r\nThe paper is explicit about the application and adaptation of grounded theory to meet the needs of the research and the epistemology of the researcher.  Many studies purporting to use grounded theory are less explicit, this paper is intended to contribute to the discussion and development of a flexible approach to grounded theory, fit for purpose within the restraints of a practitioner based virtual educational ethnographic study.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e  \r\n\r\nThe relationship of the practitioner researcher (an Associate Lecturer) and the participants (the students) created a dichotomy between the neutrality and social distance of the researcher and the ethical implications for the Associate Lecturer.  Whilst the participants were not vulnerable adults, many of the participants were novice learners returning to study and therefore a duty of care was required. The paper explains how the adaptation of constructed grounded theory enhanced the analysis and provided richer data than ethnographic observation alone.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\nDespite the divergence from constructed grounded theory methods, rigor was achieved through the comparison of the coding produced throughout the analysis of the data.  This level of rigor led to the emergence of unanticipated themes which influenced the group work processes.  It is my belief that these would not have appeared through generic inductive approaches as they would have been overlooked and ignored without the line by line analysis.  The modification of the grounded theory process retained the influence of constructed grounded theory rather than claiming to be rooted in constructed grounded theory. But the techniques applied are not beyond comparison with grounded theory.  The research into virtual group work is timely in light of recent UK Government reports and relevant as interest in network delivered learning continues to grow.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bradley, S.

What the experience of receiving (mobile) phone calls can tell us about design","bibo:abstract":"This paper takes a phenomenological approach to analysing people\u0027s accounts of receiving phone calls, drawing on Heidegger and Feenberg. Accounts of calls received on a mobile phone are compared with those on landlines, charting progress from location-centred to person-centred phoning. A range of naturally-occurring contexts are discussed in terms of the experience of balancing the activities of talking on the phone with activities in the immediate environment, and the enchantment sustained or sacrificed. The study suggests that recipients\u0027 enchantment with phoning is affected by their freedom and desire to project towards the caller and create shared spaces, and reveals some factors that impact on the transitions of attention required to do so. It concludes with the design implications of taking this view of interactions with and through phones.","bibo:AuthorList":["Light, Ann"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447898,"sim:weight":0.617389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.592973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43400,"sim:weight":0.49037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108440,"sim:weight":0.485364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.484056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.471076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382006,"sim:weight":0.457902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654995,"sim:weight":0.456869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.454075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.448115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108497,"sim:weight":0.447637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.443982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.438535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.437897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447920,"sim:weight":0.434997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.430081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.416963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44852,"sim:weight":0.413523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734401,"sim:weight":0.407057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.40484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The scheme was established by the Training and Development Agency for Schools in an attempt to increase the number of graduates entering the teaching profession, particularly in shortage subjects such as the physical sciences and mathematics. The scheme places undergraduate students on short-term placements in secondary schools throughout England to provide them with experiences that may encourage them to consider teaching as a career option. Findings show that the SAS school placements were a positive experience for the students participating in this study. However, a question emerged as to whether or not the scheme is targeting students who have yet to decide upon teaching as a career or just reinforcing the existing aspirations of students who have already decided to teach. As the scheme is attempting to increase the number of teachers entering the profession this question has important implications for this study and further work which will focus on undergraduates who think that their career ambitions would not be fulfilled by teaching.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bevins, S.","Brodie, M.","Brodie, E."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47136,"sim:weight":0.683672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98717,"sim:weight":0.654592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99475,"sim:weight":0.583187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41233,"sim:weight":0.536606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.519805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.501799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.495932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.489293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.486558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5025,"sim:weight":0.484116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.465324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.464653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.463342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2834,"sim:weight":0.452036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2850,"sim:weight":0.447801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.426416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98881,"sim:weight":0.424085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.423736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336722,"sim:weight":0.391294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.382919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The purpose of these booster sessions is to help the individual maintain their increase in physical activity. Differences in physical activity, quality of life and costs associated with the booster interventions, will be measured three and nine months from randomisation. The research will be conducted in 20 of the most deprived neighbourhoods in Sheffield, which have large, ethnically diverse populations, high levels of economic deprivation, low levels of physical activity, poorer health and shorter life expectancy. Participants will be recruited through general practices and community groups, as well as by postal invitation, to ensure the participation of minority ethnic groups and those with lower levels of literacy. Sheffield City Council and Primary Care Trust fund a range of facilities and activities to promote physical activity and variations in access to these between neighbourhoods will make it possible to examine whether the effectiveness of the intervention is modified by access to community facilities.

The large dimensions together with the development of dense smoke that drastically reduces visibility, represent major challenges. The Guardians robot swarm is designed to assist fire fighters in searching a\r\nlarge warehouse. In this report we discuss the technology developed for a swarm of robots searching and assisting fire fighters. We explain the swarming algorithms which provide the functionality by which the robots react to and follow humans while no communication is required. Next we\r\ndiscuss the wireless communication system, which is a so-called mobile ad-hoc network. The communication network provides also one of the means to locate the robots and humans.

{"identifier":100490,"ep:Repository":102,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Is the Doctrine of Double Effect irrelevant in end-of-life decision making?","bibo:abstract":"In this paper, we consider three arguments for the irrelevance of the doctrine of double effect in end-of-life decision making.  The third argument is our own and, to that extent, we seek to defend it.  The first argument is that end-of-life decisions do not in fact shorten lives and that, therefore, there is no need for the doctrine in justification of these decisions.  We reject this argument; some end-of-life decisions clearly shorten lives.  The second is that the doctrine of double effect is not recognised in UK law (and similar jurisdictions); therefore, clinicians cannot use it as the basis for justification of their decisions.  Against this we suggest that whilst the doctrine might have dubious legal grounds, it could be of relevance in some ways, for example, in marking the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable practice in relation to the clinician\u0027s duty to relieve pain and suffering.  The third is that the doctrine is irrelevant because it requires there to be a bad effect that needs justification.  This is not the case in end-of-life care for patients diagnosed as dying.  Here, bringing about a satisfactory dying process for a patient is a good effect, not a bad one.  What matters is that patients die without pain and suffering.  This marks a crucial departure from the double effect doctrine; if the patient\u0027s death is not a bad effect then the doctrine is clearly irrelevant.  A diagnosis of dying allows clinicians to focus on good dying and not to worry about whether their intervention affects the time of death.  For a patient diagnosed as dying, time of death is rarely important.  In our conclusion we suggest that acceptance of our argument might be problematic for opponents of physician-assisted death.  We suggest one way in which these opponents might argue for a distinction between such practice and palliative care; this relies on the double-effect doctrine\u0027s distinction between foresight and intention.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allmark, Peter","Cobb, Mark","Liddle, B.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify strategies to improve adherence with musculoskeletal outpatient treatment.  Five suitable studies were identified which provided moderate evidence that a motivational cognitive-behavioural programme can improve attendance at exercise-based clinic sessions.  There was conflicting evidence that adherence interventions increase short-term adherence with exercise.  There was strong evidence that adherence strategies are not effective at improving long-term adherence with home exercise.  Due to the multi-dimensional nature of non-adherence, the strategies to improve adherence with physiotherapy treatment are likely to be broad in spectrum.   Combined interventions may be effective at promoting adherence with clinic appointments and exercise, though further research would be required to confirm this.  Further research to increase basic understanding of the factors which act as a barrier to adherence could facilitate development of strategies to overcome non-adherence.","bibo:AuthorList":["McLean, S.","Burton, M.","Bradley, L.","Littlewood, C."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387387,"sim:weight":0.512363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.490469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.435934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99453,"sim:weight":0.430322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.394981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.387531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.367052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.364998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.363466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83505,"sim:weight":0.336059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.312177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83563,"sim:weight":0.301083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99012,"sim:weight":0.296532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.29282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.287512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.280119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.255926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56397,"sim:weight":0.250116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335823,"sim:weight":0.23523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105295,"sim:weight":0.221377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Also included in the study are the Leads of the post-qualifying consortia in England. The study used questionnaire survey and nominal group techniques to gather data, which were coded and categorised into themes. The main findings relate to the perceived purposes of post-qualifying study, motivations for undertaking post-qualifying study, the factors that sustain and hinder study, the advice that those who have or who are experiencing post-qualifying study would give to those about to start and future plans and hopes in this area.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003ePost-qualifying study is generally valued, especially in relation to the opportunities it provides for professional development.

There are also frustrations for some candidates who do not feel that their post-qualifying study has stretched them beyond qualifying standards or who experience the teaching as divorced from the realities of daily practice. The appetite for a wider choice of post-qualifying modules suggests that providers of post-qualifying study will need to collaborate within and across regions in order to achieve a critical mass of candidates for more specialist or focused learning.

The article describes the use of a paper-based method for data analysis of online learning type research that involves the collection and collation of electronic (and possibly also paper based) data. This method partly builds on the work of Tyler (2001) and has been used on research projects that investigated online learning as a method for widening participation (Hramiak, 2001a, 2002a) and also on a project that involved the e-professional development of staff at a Further Education (FE) college (Hramiak, 2004).

Such analysis enables researchers to act upon the situation in order to improve it for the learners, as well as for themselves (Lally, 2000). This is particularly challenging when the messages are not only numerous, in the region of hundreds or even thousands, for a specific research study, but also because they can be both very complicated and very lengthy. Although tools for analyzing communication patterns have been developed in other disciplines, for example in applied linguistics, they are generally based upon the analysis of large bodies of text. They also involve relatively complex and cumbersome methods, and they are not designed for action research use in the immediacy of particular teaching and learning situations (Lally) such as those for which this article is aimed at – namely those in which students/participants are constantly messaging in real time synchronously and asynchronously. Moreover, such tools are not intentionally designed to analyze dynamic, ongoing collaborative and social situations where knowledge is actively being co-constructed by the participants (Lally).","bibo:AuthorList":["Hramiak, A."],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.461255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.45761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.422699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85720,"sim:weight":0.422454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.416913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1153659,"sim:weight":0.411575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.399397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.398035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3203,"sim:weight":0.388929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.384728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.380001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.370642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.357671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.355177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.352963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3172,"sim:weight":0.3328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.326846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.325872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41347,"sim:weight":0.310661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.307055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

His unremitting nominalism led to a radical constructivist or irrealist position. He was a constructivist not only in the sense of acknowledging the constitutive nature of our classifications of things, ultimately amounting to versions of the world, but also in the way that, following Carnap, he saw it as part of the responsibility of philosophy to construct robust and consistent systems of statements that serve as correctives to the logical disarray of natural language. He also took to its logical conclusions another of Carnap’s principles namely that the truth of a statement is dependent on a particular frame of reference...\r\n\r\nIn this paper I consider how Goodman\u0027s analysis of the forms of reference might fruitfully be applied to some educational concerns. He identifies two main species of reference, denotation and exemplification, and two main sub-species, representation and expression. Symbols may be labels or samples. I first present his theory of notation and then the operation of labels and samples in turn and consider how we might use them to describe teaching and learning. I further apply them to explain the role that experience plays in a teacher’s professional development and how they might help to characterise the personal dimension of teaching. I then present his theory of metaphor and expression and finally suggest ways in which these and his other concepts may help theorise parental choice of school as part of a re-conceptualised theory of social practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coldron, J."],"dc:date":"2010-08-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100528,"sim:weight":0.790996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85729,"sim:weight":0.559914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.53926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108223,"sim:weight":0.504917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.49081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.487704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.484673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.472649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.466219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109076,"sim:weight":0.46057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.460289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.459329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108987,"sim:weight":0.452808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.433306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.432746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.432746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108303,"sim:weight":0.432485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.431837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":72959,"sim:weight":0.431802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.419406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As teachers play a significant role in the quality of the lifelong learning as well as in motivating future generations to take part in lifelong learning, education and training for teachers becomes important; not only in relation to initial teacher education, but also in relation to a continuous development of knowledge and skills. \r\nThis paper represents the first stage of a larger comparative project intended to examine and compare educational workers’ (i.e. professionals involved in teaching in the class room) participation in higher education in England and Denmark, their access and interest. In particular, the paper relates participation and engagement to national and international educational policies and frames this work within an examination of the social background of the professional groups. The key research questions at this stage of the work are methodological and can be summed up by the overarching question, “How can the concepts of habitus and field help us to understand levels of engagement of educational workers in Higher Education”?\r\nThe paper reports the results of our review of current policies and our efforts to identify the structural relations within the educational professional fields in each country. To do so we are developing a theoretical model using the relational analytical approach advocated by Bourdieu. As such, our work is an early stage attempt at operationalising Bourdieu’s observations regarding the dynamics of field. This seems to us to provide an important conceptual approach to understanding the habitus of educational workers in the context of the dynamics of a fast changing policy arena and the complexities of the backgrounds of individuals working in the educational field. The model attempts to build in the reflexivity that Bourdieu demands for a ‘science’ that is not weakened by over-emphasis on either the objective structural relations or the subjective phenomenology of experience. \r\nThus, the paper presents a preliminary contextual analysis of the factors that enable an understanding of engagement or lack of engagement in higher level learning among school-based education workers in the two EU countries and is related to a larger research project that explores habitus (both individual and collective) among these groups of education workers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Larson, A.","Garland, P.","Mccaig, C."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.703361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.634699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82037,"sim:weight":0.59898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.568224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.552112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2834,"sim:weight":0.530828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.507347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.501468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.492492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.445571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.442861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2850,"sim:weight":0.440158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.434251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2858,"sim:weight":0.429604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98688,"sim:weight":0.425348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.423667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.421925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5025,"sim:weight":0.418877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.416327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.414938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Different forms of participation in school mathematics are discussed and the concept of ecologies of participation is proposed as a means to understand the complexity and multidimensionality of participation in both formal and informal learning contexts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boylan, M."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1584852,"sim:weight":0.447584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85165,"sim:weight":0.444652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2820,"sim:weight":0.413698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85729,"sim:weight":0.406615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.403195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98466,"sim:weight":0.400661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.399058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44915,"sim:weight":0.379695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.3736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.369999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.367755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.367393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.363446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.354817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.344968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.341867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77372,"sim:weight":0.338525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41281,"sim:weight":0.338378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.335312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.335312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Residual stresses existing in most hard coatings have significant influence on the\r\nadhesion, mechanical properties and tribological performance. In the XRD-sin2ψ stress measurement, the\r\nresidual stress value is determined through a linear regression between two parameters derived from\r\nexperimentally measured diffraction angle (2θ). Thus, the precision coefficient (R2) of the linear regression\r\nreflects the accuracy of the stress measurement, which depends strongly on how precise the 2θ values are\r\nmeasured out of a group of very broad diffraction peaks. In this research, XRD experiments were conducted on a\r\nnumber of samples, including an electron beam evaporated ZrO2 based thermal barrier coating, several\r\nmagnetron sputtered transitionmetal nitride coatings, and shot-peened superalloy components. In each case, the\r\ndiffraction peak position was determined using different methods, namely, the maximum intensity (Imax)\r\nmethod, the middle point of half maximum (MPHM) intensity method, the gravity centre method, and the\r\nparabolic approaching method. The results reveal that the R2 values varied between 0.25 and 0.99, depending on\r\nboth the tested materials and the method of the 2θ value determination. The parabolic approaching method\r\nshowed the best linear regression with R2\u003d0.93±0.07, leading to high precision of the determined residual\r\nstress value in all cases; both the MPHM (R2\u003d0.86±0.16) and gravity centre (R2\u003d0.91±0.11) methods also\r\ngave good results in most cases; and the Imax method (R2\u003d0.71±0.27) exhibited substantial uncertainty\r\ndepending on the nature of individual XRD scans.","bibo:AuthorList":["Luo, Q.","Jones, A.

This discourse analysis examined the online discussion board communications of a cohort of trainee teachers to better understand the situated identities of the trainees and how they were presented online. Their discussion board posts were the primary method of communication during placement periods and, as such, provided insight into how the trainees situated their identities in terms of being a student or being a teacher. During the analysis, the community boundaries, language and culture were explored along with the tutor\u0027s power and role in the identity transformation process. This involved looking at the lexis used by the students, the use of pronouns to refer to themselves and others such as teachers and pupils, the types of messages allowed in the community and the effect of the tutor\u0027s messages on their communication. The research found that the trainees felt comfortable with teaching but did not feel like teachers during the course. Tutors and school teachers need to develop an awareness of the dual nature of trainees\u0027 identities and help promote the transition from student to teacher. In the beginning of the course, trainees should be familiarised with teacher vocabulary and practical concepts in addition to pedagogical theory. Towards the end of the course, trainee identity as teachers could be promoted through the use of authentic assessments that mirror real teacher tasks and requirements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Irwin, B.","Hramiak, A."],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100531,"sim:weight":0.829299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82314,"sim:weight":0.552251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100481,"sim:weight":0.501681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100496,"sim:weight":0.478192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.459486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.440601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.423315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45395,"sim:weight":0.401707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.400569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5025,"sim:weight":0.397752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.395512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.390573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99934,"sim:weight":0.387671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269918,"sim:weight":0.385549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3203,"sim:weight":0.383961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.378068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.366439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.361688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99358,"sim:weight":0.349749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12367,"sim:weight":0.344186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The terms being presented, he proceeds to define expression as a metaphorical sub-species of the relation of exemplification.  I follow Goodman in first considering exemplification.  In doing so I also look at his theory of notation in so far as this introduces aspects of indeterminacy of reference.  I consider criticisms of Goodman by Peltz, Brentlinger and Jensen and use an actual musical example to try first to clarify some of the technical terms by applying them and secondly to analyse the various modes of reference used simultaneously in a small part of one work.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\nI then expound and assess his theory of metaphor. In order to do this his theory of projection has to be carefully examined.  A crucial equivocation is exposed in his appeal to similarity to explain the operation of metaphor.  I introduce the notion of an affinitive projection as a necessary and useful amendment to avoid the problems discovered. Before proceeding to examine in detail how he formulates and applies the notion of metaphorical exemplification I pause to provide an historical account of the idea of expression, identifying the main threads that contribute to this strand of modem aesthetic thought.  The theories of five influential expressive theorists are briefly outlined in order to set Goodman\u0027s account in an historical context.  His account is then examined and assessed.  An interpretation of Goodman’s theory of art as interactive is developed and certain difficulties arising from the earlier equivocation are noted. His relation to the earlier historical accounts is traced and the success of his account discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coldron, J."],"dc:date":"1982","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100503,"sim:weight":0.790996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.614729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.609513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46636,"sim:weight":0.589707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.588656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73312,"sim:weight":0.579725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381972,"sim:weight":0.565574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48268,"sim:weight":0.565463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87161,"sim:weight":0.560743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352197,"sim:weight":0.554081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":72959,"sim:weight":0.553358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383589,"sim:weight":0.536444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44235,"sim:weight":0.525032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74126,"sim:weight":0.524042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352208,"sim:weight":0.517573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385123,"sim:weight":0.512775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52494,"sim:weight":0.509408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382026,"sim:weight":0.493299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74388,"sim:weight":0.491126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87198,"sim:weight":0.480406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The analysis traces the evolution across the ‘no duty’ dictum of  Robert Addie \u0026 Sons (Collieries) –v- Dumbreck (1929) , the ‘duty of humanity’ advanced in British Railways Board –v- Herrington (1972) , the qualified duty of care introduced by the Occupiers Liability Act 1984 following the Law Commission, Report on Liability for Damage or Injury to Trespassers, Cmnd 6428 (1976) and the subsequent interpretation of that duty in case law such as Tomlinson –v- Congleton Borough Council (2002)  and Mann v Northern Electric Distribution Ltd (2010) . The paper analyses the ways in which the judiciary’s operation as an ‘interpretive community’ (Fish, 1980; 1989)  has steered this evolution and the ways in which external, supra-juridical, factors have also influenced how occupiers’ liability law has been interpreted and applied. The analysis is based upon a doctrinal and narrative analysis of the key cases, policy and legislative instalments. This analysis includes assessment of how child trespassers have been depicted and their motivations interpreted by English judges; evaluation of the impact of the 1984 Act; the influence of parallel developments in other common law jurisdictions and the interaction of occupiers’ liability law with other ‘safety’ based legislation. The analysis shows how within the broad policy and legal framework set by legislators, the common law and the 1957 and 1984 Occupiers’ Liability Acts, the courts have marked out (and pragmatically adjusted)  the limits of the ‘reasonable’ safety provision required of  occupiers for lawful visitors and trespassers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bennett, L."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67449,"sim:weight":0.471086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.425047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100158,"sim:weight":0.42175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46839,"sim:weight":0.361718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661645,"sim:weight":0.350953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661682,"sim:weight":0.350258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.347785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.346984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.346527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.338759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.33623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.334741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.33252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99043,"sim:weight":0.331471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352201,"sim:weight":0.331205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.322748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383568,"sim:weight":0.313602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.312403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.311042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382037,"sim:weight":0.306243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Indeed the role of the user evaluation was dual: by testing a specific prototype it was possible to gain a micro-view and assess the effectiveness of each component of the complex system; by cumulating the result of all the evaluations (in total 43 people were involved) it was possible to build a macro-view of how cross-language retrieval would impact on users and their tasks.

Considering users at the early stages compels designers to think in terms of utility and usability and helps develop a system based on what is actually needed. This paper discusses the case of HyperAudio, a context-sensitive adaptive and mobile museum guide developed in the late 1990s. User requirements were collected via a survey to understand visitors\u0027 profiles and visit styles in natural science museums. The knowledge acquired supported the specification of system requirements, helping define the user model, data structure and adaptive behaviour of the system. User requirements guided the design decisions on what could be implemented by using simple adaptable triggers, and what instead needed more sophisticated adaptive techniques. This is a fundamental choice when all the computation must be done on a PDA. Graphical and interactive environments for developing and testing complex adaptive systems are discussed as a further step in an iterative design process that considers the user interaction to be the central point. This paper discusses how such an environment allows designers and developers to experiment with different system behaviours and to widely test it under realistic conditions by simulating the actual context evolving over time. The understanding gained in HyperAudio is then considered from the perspective of later developments: our findings still appers to be valid despite the time that had passed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petrelli, Daniela","Not, Elena"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8997932,"sim:weight":0.546337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99176,"sim:weight":0.507672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.495426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932725,"sim:weight":0.491946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.481955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.456012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933590,"sim:weight":0.443243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.439028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1339,"sim:weight":0.433505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.428354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.412181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.407557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.391563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.384624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.378445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.375394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929252,"sim:weight":0.360292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.357217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.346559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.339539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both sounds and pictures triggered active collaborative reminiscing, and attempts to capture iconic representations of events. However sounds differed from photos in that they were more varied, familial and creative. Further, they often expressed the negative or mundane in order to be \u0027true to life\u0027, and were harder to interpret than photos. Finally we saw little use of pure explanatory narrative.

Despite this, we know little about the processes by which people identify and manage mementos - objects which are directly meaningful to their memories. Among the millions of objects people encounter in a lifetime, few become such reminders of people, places or events. We report fieldwork where participants gave us a tour of their homes describing how and why particular objects become mementos. Our findings extend the existing digital memory literature; first our participants didn\u0027t view their activities as experiential \u0027capture\u0027, nor were mementos limited to pictorial representations of people and events; instead they included everyday objects. Furthermore, mementos were not only displayed and shared, but also integrated into everyday activities. Finally there were complex relations between house location and memento type.

In this paper, we look holistically at the interaction between users and semantic data, and propose multiple visualization strategies and dynamic filters to support the exploration of semantic-rich data. We discuss a user evaluation and how interaction challenges could be overcome to create an effective user-centred framework for the visualization and manipulation of semantic data.

Current wisdom is that the pay gap exists because of men\u0027s power to control the workplace, and men\u0027s dominant position in society generally. This paper examines an emergent literature on matriarchal power structures and proposes Attraction Theory as a holistic framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrior Work: This paper acknowledges a range of feminist literature that examines the underlying social relations and power structures that impact on pay differentials. This is critiqued on the basis of findings from courtship research as well as studies emerging\nfrom liberal / progressive writers in the men\u0027s movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproach: This paper is conceptual, using an inter-disciplinary understanding of social\nprocesses to critically appraise both the dominant discourse on equal pay and its\nemergent alternative. Attraction Theory is presented as a framework for exploring a\ncomplex discourse that unequal pay exists both because of men\u0027s power to control the\nworkplace and women\u0027s power to control courtship and family life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImplications: Tackling pay inequality and work-life balance issues by focussing on power sharing in the workplace represents only a partial policy solution. Further progress depends on power-sharing in parental rights through academic recognition and political action to tackle negative stereotypes that impact on men during romantic courtship, conception, birth and divorce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValue: The value of the paper lies in the originality of the analysis and the range of\ninsights that Attraction Theory provides into societal dynamics that impact on equal pay.\nThe identification of paradoxes in the dominant discourse opens up new avenues for\nresearch and policy development on work-life balance. Whether these will close the pay\ngap is unclear, but it would advance equality and diversity goals by creating confidence\nthat consensual choices rather the institutional inequalities perpetuate any remaining inequalities reported in statistics.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Ridley-Duff, R."],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A dynamic Landau de Gennes theory of nematic liquid crystals is solved numerically to model the electric field induced latching of the device and the results are compared with experimental measurements and theoretical approximations. The study gives a clear insight into the latching mechanism dynamics and enables the dependence of the device latching on both material parameters and surface shape to be determined. Analytical approximation highlights a route to optimize material selection in terms of latching voltages and the numerical model, which includes an accurate surface representation, recovers the complex surface shape effects. Predictions of device performance are presented as a function of both surface anchoring strength and surface shape and grating pitch. A measurement of the homeotropic anchoring energy has been undertaken by comparing the voltage response as a function of cell gap; we find the homeotropic anchoring energies can be varied in the range 0.5 to 4 (10-44 J m-2).","bibo:AuthorList":["Spencer, T.

Yet despite this, educational software has traditionally attempted to harness games as extrinsic motivation by using them as a sugar coating for learning content. This article tests the concept of intrinsic integration as a way of creating a more productive relationship between educational games and their learning content. Two studies assessed this approach by designing and evaluating an educational game called Zombie Division to teach mathematics to 7- to 11-year-olds. Study 1 examined the learning gains of 58 children who played either the intrinsic, extrinsic, or control variants of Zombie Division for 2 hr, supported by their classroom teacher. Study 2 compared time on task for the intrinsic and extrinsic variants of the game when 16 children had free choice of which game to play. The results showed that children learned more from the intrinsic version of the game under fixed time limits and spent 7 times longer playing it in free-time situations. Together, these studies offer evidence for the genuine value of an intrinsic approach for creating effective educational games. The theoretical and commercial implications of these findings are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Habgood, MP Jacob","Ainsworth, Shaaron E"],"dc:date":"2011-04-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

With treatment, the condition has a positive prognosis but ironically patients undergo treatment similar to that for invasive breast cancer.  There is a lack of longitudinal qualitative research studying women’s experiences of ductal carcinoma in situ, especially amongst newly diagnosed patients and how experiences change over time. \r\nMethods: Forty-five women took part in an initial interview following a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ and twenty-seven took part in a follow-up interview 9-13 months later.  Data were collected between January 2007 and October 2008.  Transcripts were analysed using a hybrid approach to thematic analysis.\r\nFindings: Women’s early perceptions of ductal carcinoma in situ merged and sometimes conflicted with their lay beliefs of breast cancer.  Perceptions and experiences of the condition shifted over time.  These overriding aspects were evident within four themes identified across the interviews: 1) perceptions of DCIS versus breast cancer, 2) from paradox to acceptance, 3) personal impact, and 4) support and interactions with others.\r\nConclusion: This study represents one of the few longitudinal qualitative studies with newly diagnosed patients, capturing women’s initial and shifting experiences and perceptions of the condition.  The issues identified need to be recognised in clinical practice and supported appropriately.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kennedy, Fiona","Harcourt, Diana","Rumsey, Nichola"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It may, however, fit into an existing module as a topic but require some careful design of teaching and assessment activities to properly align it to the intended learning outcomes of the module. This paper describes and evaluates a three year project to align the teaching and assessment of FCA with the learning outcomes of a final-year undergraduate Smart Applications module at Sheffield Hallam University. Biggs\u0027 constructive alignment was used, incorporating an adapted version of Yin\u0027s case study research method, in an iterative\r\nprocess; progressively modifying teaching and assessment activities to align them more closely with the prescribed learning outcomes. The process involved examining conclusions made by students, from carrying out\r\nFCA case study assignments, to draw cross-case conclusions about the learning outcomes achieved, and how they deviated from the prescribed ones. These cross-case conclusions were used to feed back into the design of learning and assessment activities for the next delivery of the module.\r\nAfter three cycles, the learning outcomes achieved closely matched the prescribed learning outcomes of the module.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andrews, Simon","Polovina, Simon","Andrews, Simon","Hill, Richard","Scharfe, Henrik","Øhrstrøm, Peter"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Using analytical high resolution TEM, EELS, FEG-SEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy, this paper reports detailed structural and chemical characterization of the coatings grown at various CH4: N2 ratios. Meanwhile, the mechanical and tribological properties were also measured, including hardness, Young’s modulus, residual stress and the dry-sliding friction and wear at varying environmental humidity. When CH4 gas was introduced in the deposition, the structure of the coatings has been found to experience a change from nano-scale TiAlN-VN multilayer architecture to a complex mixture of columnar grains of nc-TiAlV(N,C)/a-C nanocomposites and inter-column network of sp2-type amorphous carbon. Carbon incorporation and segregation also shows remarkable influence on the columnar growth model by leading to finer grain size. As compared to the carbon-free nitride coating, the nanocomposite coatings showed substantially reduced residual stress owing to the free-carbon precipitation, whereas the coatings maintained comparable hardness to the carbon-free TiAlN/VN. Their tribological properties were found to be strongly dependent on the environment. In humid air at RH \u003e 30%, the coatings showed low friction coefficient less than 0.4 and extremely low wear rate at a scale of ~10-17 m3N-1m-1.","bibo:AuthorList":["Luo, Quanshun","Wang, Shun Cai","Zhou, Zhaoxia","Chen, Linghao"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Previous literature, maintaining\r\nthe need for a marketing approach to festivals, identifi es the need\r\nfor maintaining strong stakeholder relationships in order to succeed\r\nin a business environment; attention has been focused to the theory\r\nof relationship marketing (RM) because of the recognition that this\r\npractice is complementary to the marketing of festivals. The very nature\r\nof the music festival as an annual, usually, 4-day event means that\r\neffective marketing is needed to keep connections with the consumer\r\nthroughout the year. This article focuses on the RM techniques\r\nutilised within the music festival industry from the viewpoint of the\r\nfestival organiser in an attempt to establish how festival organisations\r\nvalue and monitor organisational relationships. This article explores\r\nthe extent to which these relationships are valued and managed;\r\nfurthermore, the variations between these intricate relationships\r\nare considered by focusing on those held with the organisation ’ s\r\nconsumers and sponsors, the results of which have provided the\r\nability to establish the importance and relevance of RM to the industry\r\nand further identify the marketing communication methods employed\r\nto establish and maintain such relationships. In-depth, convergent\r\ninterviews have been conducted with a segment of music festival\r\norganisers from a range of events.

For example, approximately thirty percent of early lung cancer is missed on chest radiographs when the evidence is clearly visible in retrospect. Currently computer-aided detection (CAD) uses software, designed to reduce errors by drawing radiologists\u0027 attention to possible abnormalities by placing prompts on images. Alberdi et al examined the effects of CAD prompts on performance, comparing the negative effect of no prompt on a cancer case with prompts on a normal case. They showed that no prompt on a cancer case can have a detrimental effect on reader sensitivity and that the reader performs worse than if the reader was not using CAD. This became particularly apparent when difficult cases were being read. They suggested that the readers were using CAD as a decision making tool instead of a prompting aid. They conclude that \"incorrect CAD can have a detrimental effect on human decisions\".

Rarely, however, is the notion of women\u0027s autonomy interrogated for its conceptual adequacy or usefulness for understanding the determinants of women\u0027s reproductive health, effective policy formulation or program design. Using ethnographic data from 2001, including social mapping exercises, observation of daily life, interviews, case studies and focus group discussions, this paper draws attention to the incongruities between the concept of women\u0027s autonomy and the gendered social, cultural, economic and political realities of women\u0027s lives in rural Punjab, Pakistan. These inadequacies include: the concept\u0027s undue emphasis on women\u0027s independent, autonomous action; a lack of attention to men and masculinities; a disregard for the multi-sited constitution of gender relations and gender inequality; an erroneous assumption that uptake of reproductive health services is an indicator of autonomy; and a failure to explore the interplay of other axes of disadvantage such as caste, class or socio-economic position. This paper calls for alternative, more nuanced, theoretical approaches for conceptualizing gender inequalities in order to enhance our understanding of women\u0027s reproductive wellbeing in Pakistan. The extent to which our arguments may be relevant to the wider South Asian context, and women\u0027s lives in other parts of the world, is also discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mumtaz, Zubia","Salway, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2009-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, seminal work by Malone (1981), exploring the motivational aspects of digital games, concluded that the educational effectiveness of a digital game depends on the way in which learning content is integrated into the fantasy context of the game. In particular, he claimed that content which is intrinsically related to the fantasy will produce better learning than that which is merely extrinsically related. However, this distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic (or endogenous and exogenous) fantasy is a concept that has developed a confused standing over the following years. This paper will address this confusion by providing a review and critique of the empirical and theoretical foundations of endogenous fantasy, and its relevance to creating educational digital games. Substantial concerns are raised about the empirical basis of this work and a theoretical critique of endogenous fantasy is offered, concluding that endogenous fantasy is a misnomer, in so far as the \"integral and continuing relationship\" of fantasy cannot be justified as a critical means of improving the effectiveness of educational digital games.

Games with intrinsic fantasy are defined as having “an integral and continuing relationship with the instructional content being presented”, and are claimed as “more interesting and more educational” than extrinsic fantasy games [1]. Studies of children making educational games have shown they usually create extrinsic games for curriculum learning content. In this study, children were encouraged to create non-curriculum games, more easily distanced from the extrinsic preconceptions of formal schooling. Forty, 7-11 year olds took part in this study (17 boys and 23 girls), designing and making their own games at an after-school club. Despite non-curriculum learning content, no more intrinsic games were created than in previous studies. The children failed to create their own pedagogical models for non-curriculum content and did not see the educational value of intrinsic fantasy games. The implications for transfer and learning in intrinsic games are discussed whilst the definition of intrinsic fantasy itself is questioned. It is argued that the integral relationship of fantasy is unlikely to be the most critical means of improving the educational effectiveness of digital games.","bibo:AuthorList":["Habgood, M P Jacob","Ainsworth, Shaaron","Benford, Steve"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, the numerical results presented here show that\r\nin the far infrared there is a range in which valence-band-based transitions dominate the photocurrent and these can be sustained under perpendicular incidence. This would lead to devices that do not need prisms and couplers in contrast with conduction-band based intersubband absorbers. Examples for different quantum well structures and different thermal source temperatures are compared and contrasted numerically. It is further demonstrated that many body effects, so far ignored in simulations of materials for photovoltaic and thermophotovoltaic applications, are shown to be of relevance for both conduction (TM Mode) and valence-band based (TE Mode) configurations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pereira, Mauro"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is therefore important that there is a sufficient amount of veining and that it maintains its\r\nblue appearance to be appealing to consumers therefore leading to maximised sales potential and profit for\r\nthe manufacturing company. Optimum in vitro growth mimicking the conditions typically found in prepacked\r\nblue cheeses, and using lactose as the sole carbon source, was facilitated by a gas mixture of 5%\r\noxygen ⁄0% carbon dioxide ⁄ balance nitrogen). The work undertaken in this study determined that the\r\nfactors for optimum in vitro growth of Penicillium roquefortii (strain PRB6) were: a temperature of\r\n20 ± 1 �C, pH of 6.0 ± 0.1, and a relative humidity of 70 ± 0.1%. Further in vitro studies have also shown\r\nthat the increasing ‘in-pack’ carbon dioxide concentration not only depresses the growth of P. roquefortii but\r\nalso affects immature conidiospore pigmentation (no effect has been seen on mature conidiospore\r\npigmentation). The implications of this study suggest that the majority of pre-packed internally mould\r\nripened blue cheeses on sale in supermarkets are packaged in inappropriate materials. For some cheeses (e.g.\r\nthe Roquefort-type cheeses) this is not an issue since these are packed in a much more mature state and some\r\nloss of veining colour is not appreciably noticeable.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fairclough, Andrew","Cliffe, Dawn","Knapper, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Flexible practices with property and ICT implications, working from home without a dedicated work station, formal policies, \u0027hot\u0027 desking, flexible offices and satellite or drop-in offices are less common (ca 10%) but have grown significantly in the last two years. A number of councils also report being at the stage of planning pilots. \r\nFive detailed case studies are reported. Three authorities have expanding strategic programmes for \u0027workstyle\u0027 changes or new ways of working. One has shifted its emphasis away from such plans toward higher density office usage only and one was awaiting the election result before anticipated permission to start.\r\nThese cases do all come from authorities in areas of much higher than average property values and costs. While they have seen savings, they emphasise that the initiatives were equally about better work life balance and improved office environments. Green benefits and service enhancements are harder to quantify but are believed to have been achieved. Higher density of net space utilisation has uniformly been achieved.\r\nExecutive commitment and clear member support are seen as critical strategic success factors. Clear liaison between HR, Property/ Facilities and ICT has been essential to operational success. Entrenched management attitudes and, at least initially, staff reluctance to change, are cited as the major drawbacks. Accounting and valuation practices can also be a barrier.\r\nSimilar messages are provided by a variety of pilots, some undertaken deliberately as strategic tests, others as much more of an ad hoc response to local circumstances. Most have not, or not yet, seen net office space reduced. The more successful pilots were not \u0027just\u0027 either property or HR policy initiatives: indeed there is some evidence that initiatives involving only one of the two functions have been less successful.\r\nService areas most frequently cited as being involved in changes are various property functions. Trading Standards and Social Services are other areas where the real or potential development of flexible working and shared desking is highlighted though the latter in particular is also cited as an area where workers in the office have particular mutual support needs. Higher density officing for less mobile workers is, in principle, an option more widely available. \r\nWorkplace strategy should reflect future service delivery models, asset management plans and organisational development. New ways of working have been a tool for achieving changes in culture and delivery, but were, and are, a challenge to traditional mindsets. They will involve senior property professionals in a range of issues with which they have not traditionally been associated. Future property and workplace strategy will be driven by an authority\u0027s service models and aspirations as to working culture: but will also be a tool, alongside organisational development (OD) and ICT, to achieve change and improvement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Price, Ilfryn"],"dc:date":"2001-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Beams (100mm x 150mm cross section) were subjected to accelerated corrosion in the laboratory and subsequently tested in flexure to failure. The paper reports on the results of these tests and relates the degree of corrosion in the main steel to the percentage loss in stiffness in the concrete beams.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Flaherty, Fin","Mangat, Pal","Lambert, Paul","Brown, E.

Obesity increases the risk of adverse outcomes during pregnancy and birth and has significant cost implications for maternity services. Gestational weight management strategies are a high priority; however the evidence for effective, feasible and acceptable weight control interventions is limited and inconclusive. This qualitative study explored the experiences and perceptions of pregnant women and midwives regarding existing support for weight management in pregnancy and their ideas for service development.\r\n\r\nMethods - \r\nA purposive sample of 6 women and 7 midwives from Doncaster, UK, participated in two separate focus groups. Transcripts were analysed thematically.\r\n\r\nResults - \r\nTwo overarching themes were identified, \u0027Explanations for obesity and weight management\u0027 and \u0027Best care for pregnant women\u0027. \u0027Explanations\u0027 included a lack of knowledge about weight, diet and exercise during pregnancy; self-talk messages which excused overeating; difficulties maintaining motivation for a healthy lifestyle; the importance of social support; stigmatisation; and sensitivity surrounding communication about obesity between midwives and their clients. \u0027Best care\u0027 suggested that weight management required care which was consistent and continuous, supportive and non-judgemental, and which created opportunities for interaction and mutual support between obese pregnant women.\r\n\r\nConclusions - \r\nWomen need unambiguous advice regarding healthy lifestyles, diet and exercise in pregnancy to address a lack of knowledge and a tendency towards unhelpful self-talk messages. Midwives expressed difficulties in communicating with their clients about their weight, given awareness that obesity is a sensitive and potentially stigmatising issue.

Whereas an organism is a creation of natural replicators, genes, an organisation can be seen as a product of an alternative replicator, the meme or mental model, acting, like a gene, to preserve itself in an Evolutionary Stable System. The result is an organisation which self organises around a set of unspoken and unwritten rules and assumptions.\r\n \r\nBiological evolution is stimulated by environmental change and reproductive isolation; the process of punctuated equilibrium. Corporate innovation shows the same pattern. Innovations in products and processes occur in groups isolated from prevailing mental norms.\r\n\r\nSuccessful organic strains possess a genetic capability for adaptation. Organisations which wish to foster learning can develop an equivalent, mental capability. Unlike their biological counterparts they can exert conscious choice and puncture the memetic codes that seek to keep them stable; the mental models of individuals, and the strategies, paradigms and unwritten rules at the company level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Price, Ilfryn"],"dc:date":"1995-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Research for this thesis has shown that Joseph Gales, the Sheffield publisher, was active in supporting the reform movement through his newspaper the Sheffield Register, with the help of his wife Winifred, a novelist, and his assistant, the poet James Montgomery, until the flight of the Galeses to America in 1794-95. However, existing historical scholarship has not explored the archival material in depth to reveal the detailed content of their radical journalism and publishing in the key years 1791-94. There is also a pronounced gap, despite the presence of a significant archive, in the later activities of the Galeses in North America, and of Montgomery in Sheffield in 1794-97. This thesis will seek to fill this gap in historical knowledge by showing in more detail the content and depth of their radical journalism and writings, their links with national and international reformers, and how their later claims of moderation are contradicted by the newly available data. This will be achieved by exploring the letters, poems, and editorials, of the Sheffield Register, the Sheffield Iris, and the Raleigh Register newspapers, the ―Recollections,‖ letters and novels of Winifred Gales, and the poems and prose writings of James Montgomery. There will also be a consideration of their place in the rise of a middling-sort class awareness, transatlantic radicalism, the role of feminist autobiographical diaries, and the boosterist activities of the Galeses in North Carolina.","bibo:AuthorList":["Daly, Michael James"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.642554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44084,"sim:weight":0.602795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.597615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382093,"sim:weight":0.597286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.593145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45273,"sim:weight":0.590207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731545,"sim:weight":0.57512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316123,"sim:weight":0.574614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187794,"sim:weight":0.57403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46234,"sim:weight":0.572694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44678,"sim:weight":0.571954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.569576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383665,"sim:weight":0.566007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43413,"sim:weight":0.565743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43819,"sim:weight":0.55854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.557954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9552792,"sim:weight":0.557031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44524,"sim:weight":0.556897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382035,"sim:weight":0.556614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382026,"sim:weight":0.555649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For years, researchers have experimented with the cutting edge\r\ntechnology of the day; now, with the convergence of internet and wireless technology, and the increasing adoption of the Web as a platform for the publication of information, the visitor is able to exploit cultural heritage material before, during and after the visit, having different goals and requirements in each phase. However, cultural heritage sites have a huge amount of information to present, which must be filtered and personalized in order to enable the individual user to easily access it. Personalization of cultural heritage information requires a system that is able to model the user\r\n(e.g., interest, knowledge and other personal characteristics), as well as contextual aspects, select the most appropriate content, and deliver it in the most suitable way. It should be noted that achieving this result is extremely challenging in the case of first-time users, such as tourists who visit a cultural heritage site for the first time (and maybe the only time in their life). In addition, as tourism is a social activity, adapting to the individual is not enough because groups and communities have to be modeled and supported as well, taking into account their mutual interests, previous mutual experience, and requirements. How to model and represent the user(s) and the context of the visit and how to reason with regard to the information that is available are the challenges faced by researchers in personalization of cultural heritage. Notwithstanding the effort invested so far, a definite solution is far from being reached, mainly because new technology and new aspects of personalization are constantly being introduced. This article surveys the research in this area. Starting from the earlier systems, which presented cultural heritage information in kiosks, it summarizes the evolution of personalization techniques in museum web sites, virtual collections and mobile guides, until recent extension of cultural heritage toward the semantic and social web. The paper concludes with current challenges and points out areas where future research is needed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ardissono, Liliana","Kufik, Tsvi","Petrelli, Daniela"],"dc:date":"2011-10-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Italian speaking users generated 618 queries for a set of known-item search tasks. The queries generated by user’s interaction with the system have been analysed and the results used to suggest recommendations for the future development of cross-language retrieval systems for digital image libraries. \r\n\r\nMethodology: A controlled lab-based user study was carried out using a prototype Italian-English image retrieval system. Participants were asked to carry out searches for 16 images provided to them, a known-item search task. User’s interactions with the system were recorded and queries were analysed manually quantitatively and qualitatively. \r\n\r\nFindings: Results highlight the diversity in requests for similar visual content and the weaknesses of Machine Translation for query translation. Through the manual translation of queries we show the benefits of using high-quality translation resources. The results show the individual characteristics of user’s whilst performing known-item searches and the overlap obtained between query terms and structured image captions, highlighting the use of user’s search terms for objects within the foreground of an image.\r\n\r\nLimitations and Implications: This research looks in-depth into one case of interaction and one image repository. Despite this limitation, the discussed results are likely to be valid across other languages and image repository.\r\n\r\nValue: The growing quantity of digital visual material in digital libraries offers the potential to apply techniques from CLIR to provide cross-language information access services. However, to develop effective systems requires studying user’s search behaviours, particularly in digital image libraries. The value of this paper is in the provision of empirical evidence to support recommendations for effective cross-language image retrieval system design.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petrelli, Daniela","Clough, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, army ants develop a three-lane pattern in their traffic, while human pedestrians generate a main trail and secondary trials in either direction.\r\n\r\nOur robot swarm approach is bottom-up: designing individual agents we first investigate the mathematics of cases occurring when applying the artificial potential field method to three \u0027perfect\u0027 robots. We show that traffic lane pattern will not be disturbed by the internal system of forces. Next, we define models of sensor designs to account for the practical fact that robots (and ants) have limited visibility and compare the sensor models in groups of three robots. In the final step we define layouts of a highway: an unbounded open space, a trail with surpassable edges and a hard defined (walled) highway.\r\n\r\nHaving defined the preliminaries we run swarm simulations and look for emerging traffic patterns.

Literature related to a neo-Darwinian view of human culture is discussed and a number of difficulties related to an absence of consensus amongst theorists are highlighted. The neo-Darwinian perspective demands a replicator in culture which is analogous to the gene in biology and the candidate for that replicator has become know as the meme. The abduction of a narrative orientated methodology for searching for such a replicator is explained and its application demonstrated through an example of coded data. The analysis is based on a structural narrative approach and in particular on the notion of narrative programmes which interact and perhaps compete in social environments.

The activity of the enzyme (as measured by the change in starch apparent viscosity) was maintained by the presence of calcium, probably by protecting the enzyme from heat denaturation. Enhancement of α-amylase activity by calcium at 37 °C was also observed although to a smaller extent. Sensory analysis showed a general trend of decreased\r\nthickness perception in the presence of calcium, but the result was only significant for one pair of samples, suggesting a limited impact of calcium enhanced enzyme activity on perceived thickness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morris, Cecile"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The Tool–Narayanaswamy–Moynihan (TNM) model was used to describe the ageing for all samples under all conditions. Three TNM parameters: x, Dh⁄ and A were determined experimentally using, respectively, the peak shift method (x) and the dependency of T0f (the limiting value of Tf) on the cooling rate (Dh⁄ and A). The non-linearity parameter x and the non exponential parameter b were also estimated by optimising a fit of the experimental normalised specific heat at different ageing times and temperatures to curves generated using the TNM model. The TNM model successfully described the normalised experimental data. It was found that the intermolecular forces were strong and the relaxation times depended more strongly on the glass structure than the glass temperature. The hydration level of the starch had a direct impact of the breadth of the relaxation time distribution. A dependency of the non-linearity parameter x on ageing temperature (peak shift method) was observed. This suggests that physical ageing is more complex than is described by TNM formalism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morris, Cecile","Talylor, Andy J.","Farhata, Imad A.","MacNaughtan, William"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Technological solutions are being sought\r\nto lower the salt content of processed foods without altering their taste. In this study, the approach was to deliver salt solutions in pulses of different concentrations to determine whether a pulsed delivery profile affected sensory perception of salt. Nine different salt profiles were delivered by a Dynataste device and a trained panel assessed their saltiness using time–intensity and single-score sensory techniques. The profile duration (15 s) was designed to match eating conditions and the effects of intensity and duration of the pulses on sensory perception were investigated. Sensory results from the profiles delivered in either water or in a bouillon base were not statistically different. Maximum perceived salt intensities and the area under the time–\r\nintensity curves correlated well with the overall perceived\r\nsaltiness intensity despite the stimulus being delivered as\r\nseveral pulses.

A similar change occurred in the age standardised incidence ratios, from 35 (95% CI: 26–47) in 1991 to 365 (95% CI: 314–425) in 2001. The temporal increase was not limited to children born during specific years nor to children diagnosed in a specific time period. The rate of diagnosis of PDDs other than autism rose from zero for the period 1988–1992 to 1.06/10,000 person-years in 2001. The rate of diagnosis of autism also increased but to a lesser extent.

Findings showed that most respondents supported (in principle) the notion of human rights for all, but tended to engage in low key political activity (e.g. signing petitions; donating money or goods to charity) rather than actively working towards positive social change.

The mechanisms underlying this effect may include slowed gastric clearance and attenuated uptake from the small intestine. In order to assess whether alginate could be effective as a means of appetite control in free-living adults, 68 males and females (BMI range: 18.50-32.81 kgl M-2) completed this randomised, controlled two-way crossover intervention to compare the effects of 7 day daily ingestion of a strong-gelling sodium alginate formulation against a control. A sodium alginate with a high-guluronate content was chosen because, upon ingestion, it forms a strong gel in the presence of calcium ions. Daily preprandial ingestion of the sodium alginate formulation produced a significant 134.8 kcal (7%) reduction in mean daily energy intake. This reduced energy intake was underwritten by significant reductions in mean daily carbohydrate, sugar, fat, saturated fat and protein intakes. The absence of any significant interaction effects between the main effect of preload type and those of gender, BMI classification and/or timing of preload delivery indicates the efficacy of this treatment for individuals in different settings. These findings suggest a possible role for a strong-gelling sodium alginate formulation in the future management of overweight and obesity. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Much opposition to the doctrine of spontaneous generation came from the Victorian scientific naturalists, especially John Tyndall, Professor of Natural Philosophy at the Royal Institution, London.\r\nThis thesis provides an understanding of and explanations for the beliefs surrounding the spontaneous generation debate, particularly with regard to Victorian scientific naturalism and its relationship to medicine. Spontaneous generation threatened some of the fundamental tenets of naturalism. Furthermore, Tyndall clearly related his opposition to spontaneous generation to his support for\r\nthe germ theory which he used as a vehicle for advocating a\r\nscientific approach to medicine.\r\nThe thesis concludes that Tyndall\u0027s campaign for scientific medicine was part of the scientific naturalists\u0027 campaign to spread the naturalistic world-view and to gain cultural leadership. The spontaneous generation debate is examined in detail. The shift in experimental paradigm away from physical conditions towards a bacteriological approach is described.\r\nChapter 5 examines the threats an acceptance of spontaneous generation posed to naturalism in terms\r\nof evolution, protoplasm and naturalistic explanations of disease.\r\nThe effects of Tyndall\u0027s campaign for the germ theory on the medical profession are described.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how scientific knowledge was introduced into medicine, Chapter 6 examines the work of key medical scientists in the field of pathology with reference to their involvement in the\r\nspontaneous generation debate and in particular the reasons for their acceptance or rejection of the germ theory.\r\n\r\nChapter 7 shows how the spontaneous generation debate impacted the domain of public health\r\nfrom the 1870s-1890s by means of a detailed examination of handbooks of sanitation and hygiene. The gradual introduction of results from the spontaneous generation debate into these works demonstrates the importance of the spontaneous generation debate in forming a bridge from the medical knowledge of the 1860s to the new bacteriology of\r\nthe 1880s.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adam, Alison E."],"dc:date":"1988","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":73485,"sim:weight":0.192884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2905,"sim:weight":0.182382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3198,"sim:weight":0.162588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48393,"sim:weight":0.161167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":246504,"sim:weight":0.15104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46573,"sim:weight":0.150213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48318,"sim:weight":0.146051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.145873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382088,"sim:weight":0.144648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45890,"sim:weight":0.141317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":246505,"sim:weight":0.139352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.139248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.137944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99424,"sim:weight":0.137694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382059,"sim:weight":0.130201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.122712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47606,"sim:weight":0.121237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48336,"sim:weight":0.117373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.109666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.103789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An attempt is made to counterbalance the tendency of researchers in this area to be judgmental of underusers who \"neglect\" their children, and their own health care needs, -by reporting the mothers\u0027 views of the child health services in their own terms.\r\nUnderusers within a certain Health Authority area were identified using a purposely developed Index of Uptake. The achieved sample of predominantly working class mothers constituted a group of people who are particularly difficult to research. It is believed that success\r\nin locating and eliciting evidence from this group was in itself an important contribution to the research literature.\r\nIn depth interviews were undertaken, and the data analysed in two ways; (1) A Subsample, made up of those having made least use of the services available to them, was analysed interpretively to provide detailed material of an idiographic kind on the lifeworld of the person and the place of medical care within it; (2) All interviews\r\nwere subjected to content analysis to provide a more general picture of mothers\u0027 experiences of health care provision.\r\nThe main findings include the following; (1) The particular population studied had a generally low level of visage as assessed by the index, but use of specifically medical provision was greater. A process of rational decision making is implicated. (2) Accounts of underusers\u0027\r\nexperiences highlight as a central theme the mothers\u0027 vulnerability to personal undermining by many aspects of health care provision.\r\nThe thesis concludes with a discussion of the approach which health care providers adopt towards\u0027underusers, and argues that there must be an explicit recognition of the point of view of the clients if the\r\nservices are to reach this deprived segment of the community. Such recognition is rarely found in research or comment on the problem of underusage. In fact apparently irrational and blameworthy behaviour by underusers can be. rendered explicable when considered in the light\r\nof the individuals\u0027 perceptions and experiences, and this leads to a serious questioning of the utility and appropriateness of the negative judgements made of them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hagan, Teresa"],"dc:date":"1988-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48326,"sim:weight":0.35379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383621,"sim:weight":0.3497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46638,"sim:weight":0.344886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383611,"sim:weight":0.327559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.321603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.313302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383650,"sim:weight":0.308776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17849,"sim:weight":0.305876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47369,"sim:weight":0.305806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99137,"sim:weight":0.297828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.294669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383655,"sim:weight":0.291314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383577,"sim:weight":0.289912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.289491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1541037,"sim:weight":0.285471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.266351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98701,"sim:weight":0.262933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83239,"sim:weight":0.262798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.259117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99919,"sim:weight":0.255407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The\r\nlatter option is recommended in the light of evidence\r\ngenerated through a collaborative approach involving an\r\nextensive survey of the management community.

This is the notion of the portfolio career popularised by Charles Handy (1989, 1994).Kanter(1989)suggests that such individual moves add up to a macro transition in career forms.\r\nHowever, while there is much debate about changing career, there is a dearth of qualitative studies which seek to explore the issue from the view-point of situated\r\nindividuals. In particular, there is little empirical evidence available about individuals who make their career outside of exclusive organisational employment. Drawing\r\ninductively on in depth interviews with 25 ex-NHS managers now operating various portfolio arrangements, the study set out to explore how individuals are making sense of this transition.\r\nThis research contributes a qualitative, interpretative study of individual transitions from a managerial position, which may well have embodied the principles of the\r\ntraditional career, to portfolio work. While focusing on individual interpretation, the study recognises that career is about both its objective features and individual\u0027s\r\nsubjective interpretation of them. Barley\u0027s (1989) model of the role of career in the structuring process which draws on Giddens\u0027 structuration theory is used as the theoretical base for the study. Hence the particular contribution of the study is in providing a contextualised account of sense making about a personal career transition thought to mirror wider change in career within an explicit recognition of the link between individual action and social structures.\r\nThe study contributes empirical data about organisational exit which was prompted in this case by a dynamic interaction of push and pull factors. It explores understanding of the concept, parameters and experience of portfolio working focusing, in particular on issues of training and development, social networks and revised views of career outside of employment.\r\nThe theoretical contribution primarily focuses around a model of the transition which places it within the structuring process. The transition is theorised as less of a disjunctive move than as a shading from one context to another, as individuals bring forward to portfolio work many of the material and discursive practices of their\r\nmanagerial carccr. Several interpretative schemes are identified as relevant to the sense making process, not least the notion that individuals can maintain more personal\r\nintegrity outside organisational employment. There is less evidence of a desire for instrumental relationships with organisations than the career literature might suggest\r\nand more evidence of constraints on development and growth outside of employment.\r\nThe effects of the actions and perceptions of other people in individual\u0027s interpretations of their new career is highlighted. A major theme of the study is continuity within the change as individuals seek to maintain a congruence between the objective features of their new career and how they make sense of the notion of career.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mallon, Mary"],"dc:date":"1988","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.654461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98658,"sim:weight":0.53064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.339412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45967,"sim:weight":0.287047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44207,"sim:weight":0.279478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.257638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.256502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44408,"sim:weight":0.254095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.25158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.246525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.245776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18052,"sim:weight":0.23976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3207,"sim:weight":0.238504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381947,"sim:weight":0.234343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.2339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.22845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383644,"sim:weight":0.225831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2883,"sim:weight":0.214564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2884,"sim:weight":0.212685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.210323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Pulse time modulation technique represents an attractive alternative to purely digital or purely analogue modulation schemes which has received considerable attention over the years. But very little work has been reported on pulse slope\r\nmodulation. In this work a pulse slope modulation introduced and full wavefonn characteristics is given. A simple novel receiver has been proposed, which is based on\r\nconverting the PSM waveform into a PAM waveform by sampling the received PSM signal at the rise time interval. This design eliminates the use of a differentiator and a\r\nvoltage slicer adopted in the classical demodulation technique, and it offers simplicity and improved noise performance. A new signal-t-noise formula has been presented for the first time thus enabling users to predict the system noise performance. Experimental results have shown excellent agreement to within + 1 dB with theoretical predictions using the new formula. Results obtained show the potential of PSM in tenns of simplicity and better noise perfonnance compared to its counter part pulse amplitude modulation.\r\nAlthough PTM has many advantages over analogue and digital schemes when employed as a single channel system, it becomes a challenge when multiplexing is involved.\r\nIsochronous PTM schemes are suitable while the anisochronous schemes are not. One solution to overcome this problem is to adopt a hybrid or compound modulation\r\ntechnique, where both isochronous and anisochronous schemes can be combined.\r\nCompound frequency and width modulation (CPFWM) is one such a scheme which offers bandwidth efficiency, simplicity and low cost over the more commonly used multiplexed techniques. Detailed investigation of CPFWM has been given and in an expression for its spectrum has been developed. The results obtained have been clarified practically and by means of computer simulation to within + 1 dB.\r\nIn CPFWM, cross talk in the PFM and pWM channels are due to width modulation and frequency modulation, respectively. The main cause of cross talk is the carryover energy from one edge to the next edge. This effect is studied and he results obtained for the cross talk are compared with the predicted data showing an agreement to within + 1 dB. Results were also compared with time division multiplexed pulse position modulation, showing comparable performance and under certain conditions CPFWM\r\noffering better performance.\r\nNoise performance of PFM and PWM channels has been theoretically and experimentally investigated. It has been shown that PFM is superior to PWM over a wide range of modulation indices and pulse characteristics. When both channels are identical in bandwidth and modulation conditions, PFM offers a 7 dB improvement compared to PWM channel. The noise perfonnance of CPFWM system is also\r\ncompared with digital and analogue modulation schemes. For 25 dB CNR CPFWM offers a 40 dB SNR which is 20 dB higher than amplitude modulation, 1 7 dB lower than PCM system. At CNR \u003e 35 dB its performance approaches that of PCM system.\r\nThus showing the potential of the scheme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Issa, Abd AI-Kareem M."],"dc:date":"1997-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45562,"sim:weight":0.368173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1377924,"sim:weight":0.332828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61299,"sim:weight":0.288414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46977,"sim:weight":0.277925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27154,"sim:weight":0.245064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998252,"sim:weight":0.243674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934810,"sim:weight":0.240466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997773,"sim:weight":0.220227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997771,"sim:weight":0.216938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23351,"sim:weight":0.215404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997798,"sim:weight":0.211824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999728,"sim:weight":0.210076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998402,"sim:weight":0.203789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26044,"sim:weight":0.196369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26626,"sim:weight":0.194372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999730,"sim:weight":0.194115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104124,"sim:weight":0.191317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930990,"sim:weight":0.189243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998359,"sim:weight":0.187408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27128,"sim:weight":0.187064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The thesis argues that an OD perspective should be incorporated into the main ISD paradigm and provide the basis for transformation in the field which is plagued by failure.\r\nThe thesis reviews both the IS development and Organisation Development literature and makes connections between the two fields, as in practice they are both comparable\r\nactivities. With the qualitative framework, Grounded Theory Methodology was used to guide research and analytical activities. We conducted research in 6 large and largemedium\r\nsized consultancy firms and in 5 large organisations that utilised non-traditional approaches to ISD.\r\nFieldwork and analysis resulted in the emergence of an ISD process theory that explains how information systems are developed within the organisational context. The theory\r\nprovided the basis from which we could more rigorously understand the true nature of IS development and determine the nature of a suitable OD contribution.\r\nIn this thesis, the superiority of an OD-informed solution is argued in detail and contrasted to other proposals from the ISD field. The OD contribution is distinguished in: a) formulating an OD-informed ISD approach, we have termed the Total Systems Development Approach (TSD), b) defining a diagnostic model of ISD practice, c) and providing an extensive collection of OD improvement programmes and techniques that have direct application to ISD.\r\nThe contribution the thesis makes is also multi-level. At one level we have contributed in rectifying the lack of research in the area of \"process\" in IS development. In doing so we have provided the basis from which the aspects of the ISD process can be explored in detail. The emergent ISD process theory itself confirms arguments that ISD is a\r\ncomplex socio-technical and organisational process. It highlights aspects of development that have been traditionally outside the ISD paradigm. Our theory helps\r\nreaddress and challenge a number of elements in the ISD process. The notion of approach emerges as much more suitable for solving ISD problems than methodology.\r\nThe role of the ISD consultant also emerges as requiring a range of appropriate consultation modes to deal with intervention complexity. Our results also show that the\r\nrole of the client is much more involving and demanding than previously assumed. Another area of contribution is the formulation of the TSD approach which focuses on the development of the total system: the organisation, through IS or system development activities. It is holistic, iterative, it allows flexible problem-solving, collaboration and focuses on change, intervention and reflection. A final area of contribution is in establishing a link between OD content and IS development. With the advent of new types of development, OD \"interventions\" have\r\nan increasing applicability to ISD situations. The diagnostic model of ISD practice also utilizes an OD-perspective to facilitate diagnosis of organisational failure that leads to IS failure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Goulielmos, Markos"],"dc:date":"1998-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.224867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44432,"sim:weight":0.223345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.22021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.210636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47013,"sim:weight":0.205499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46580,"sim:weight":0.202308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99444,"sim:weight":0.196726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.19177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.18908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98643,"sim:weight":0.18709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.183098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46637,"sim:weight":0.177715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383451,"sim:weight":0.173724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48424,"sim:weight":0.168455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383613,"sim:weight":0.1681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99123,"sim:weight":0.158746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47237,"sim:weight":0.157171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.151539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44406,"sim:weight":0.150724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48321,"sim:weight":0.147392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":293435,"ep:Repository":102,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Business, training and education: Sheffield circa 1880-1940","bibo:abstract":"This thesis contributes to two important debates: the historical debate on the role of education and training in Britain\u0027s relative economic decline; and the debate on the relationship between education, training and business performance. Much of the research on education, training and economic growth has focused at the macro-level and been heavily informed by neo-classical assumptions which fail to\r\ntake account of the dynamism and uncertainty inherent in the business environment. The relationship between education, training and business performance is therefore explored by developing a historical case-study approach based upon the Sheffield metal and engineering trades, c1880-1940. These were industries that were of strategic importance to the British economy and such a study allows for an exploration at the micro-level of the firm. The historical analysis is informed by the theory of business\r\nstrategy. Unlike the neo-classical synthesis, this theory locates the firm in a specific historical context, defining it as a collection of related productive resources: physical and human. Thus the theory may be used as an analytical tool to examine the impact of product, process and organisational innovations upon human resource requirements. The thesis is founded on a strong empirical base and a major empirical building block is formed by developing a database which charts the career profiles of applied science graduates from the Sheffield University and its antecedent, the Sheffield Technical School. A key finding is that the relationship between education, training and business performance is a highly complex and contingent one and that simply more education and training is not the necessary medication for the nation\u0027s economic ills. Indeed, the education and training system must be carefully monitored in order to ensure that it provides the skills and knowledge that are appropriate to changing\r\nbusiness needs. Another significant discovery is that education and training provision, prior to World War One, was generally adequate to Sheffield\u0027s business requirements; technical education became crucial to the manufacture of specialist steels, and in this key industry of the `second industrial revolution\u0027, Sheffield firms recruited metallurgy and engineering graduates and acquired a commanding technological lead over their German and American competitors. This sectoral analysis stands in stark contrast with the received wisdom which claims that Britain\u0027s relative economic decline was causally related to an under-investment in technical education and a failure to recruit scientific personnel. However, economic depression in the 1920s and consequent spending cuts led to a general\r\nweakening of the education and training system, not only in Sheffield but throughout the nation. Business demands for graduate metallurgists began to exceed the supply and, as the economy recovered in the 1930s, Sheffield firms experienced acute shortages of skilled labour. Shortages of technologists, technicians and craftsmen persisted into the 1950s and it appears that Sheffield entered the second half\r\nof the twentieth century with insufficient skilled human resources and without the necessary educational infrastructure to rapidly remedy this problem. In consequence, firms were unable to meet orders and product quality began to fail, creating a window of opportunity for foreign competitors to exploit. Two points follow from this finding: firstly, too much emphasis has been placed upon alleged educational inadequacies prior to World War One, whilst insufficient attention has been paid to the inter-war years and, secondly, the relationship between education, training and business performance appears to have a high degree of reciprocity, at least over the long-run.","bibo:AuthorList":["Eason, Mark"],"dc:date":"1997-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383522,"sim:weight":0.377014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4688,"sim:weight":0.341091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16273,"sim:weight":0.337908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381926,"sim:weight":0.316986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9636137,"sim:weight":0.3039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2837,"sim:weight":0.28627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381996,"sim:weight":0.282669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352149,"sim:weight":0.278924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45255,"sim:weight":0.27709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44207,"sim:weight":0.276399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.274942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44212,"sim:weight":0.274749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383420,"sim:weight":0.273659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.27253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99004,"sim:weight":0.271371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.270214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.265599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381947,"sim:weight":0.259944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.258941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.25822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The use of monoacylglycerols alone or in combination with free fatty acids as food preservatives has been discussed. Model systems have been devised to produce monoacylglycerols (MAGs) from butter and Shea oils with two strains of Penicillium roquefortii, FRR 2456 (isolated from a spoilt melon) and Wisbey PJ (a commercial dairy strain)\r\nA semi-micro method was developed using Preparative Thin Layer Chromatography (PTLC) and Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) of the MAG trimethylsilyl ether derivatives to determine the identification, fatty acid composition and structural isomers of the individual MAG.\r\nThe main monoacylglycerols produced by spores and emerging mycelium were 1(3)-monoacylsn-lycerols (in suspension culture). Monopalmitin was the major MAG from butter and Shea oils. Monoacylglycerols produced by fungal mycelium (in solid-state culture) were mainly the 1 (3 )-monoacyl-sn-glycerols although approximately 30% were present as 2-monoacyl-snglycerols. Again the main MAG was monopalmitin. It suggested that P. roquefortii produced two lipases, one during germination with specificity to the sn-2 position in the original triacylglycerols (TAGs) and one L3-specific during growth of the fungal mycelium. In addition, flavour compounds, methyl ketones and y-lactones, were found in solid-state culture. The composition of the MAGs formed by lipolysis using a commercial lipase (E.C.3.1.1.3) with 1,3-\r\nspecificity gave the expected 2-isomers when butter oil was the substrate but gave 1 (3)monostearin rather than the expected 2-monoolein when Shea oil was the substrate. It suggested that acyl migration occurred due to the reactive nature of the original oleate group at the sn-2 position in the Shea oil TAGs. There were no significant differences with fungal strain or temperature of incubation (10 °C and 25°C) on the composition of the MAGs.\r\nThe mechanism of formation of MAGs from butter and Shea oils has been discussed.

The pottery industry of the late nineteenth century has been little studied by business historians and this thesis makes a valuable contribution to our empirical knowledge of the industry. Response to change and competitive challenge is examined at the level of the firm and of the industry as a whole, with careful attention paid to the evolution and operation of localized business networks.\r\nA framework within which to explore these issues is developed by, firstly, considering how theories of business strategy, business culture, and the industrial district may be used to inform one another. Secondly, the business structure of the pottery industry in North Staffordshire is reconstructed for the period c. 1860-1900. The structural characteristics thus revealed are related to the organizational structures of firms in the Potteries. The industry was characterized by many competing small and medium-sized units and personal capitalism throughout the period.\r\nStrategic responses to increased competition and falling prices evolved very gradually and remained incomplete at the close of the period. Mechanization had barely commenced in 1870 and in 1914 many tasks within the industry were still carried out by highly skilled workers. The resource bases of the majority of firms thus complemented an emphasis in marketing strategies on wide product ranges and high quality goods. A detailed examination of such strategies is provided by a case study of the illustrious firm of Mintons Ltd. However, increasing external and internal competition rendered the effectiveness of this\r\ncombination of strategies increasingly uncertain and from the late 1870s the industry was pervaded by a sense of crisis. In considering the causes of crisis contemporary opinion focused increasingly on the industry as a whole, and in particular on the structure of the industry, and on inter-firm relations within the industry and district. Patterns of integration within the industry are reconstructed, and change in those patterns outlined. It is shown that the behaviour of many firms in the Potteries became increasingly opportunistic at this time. Some of the external pressure for strategic or structural change was met not by change within the firm but by exploiting the responsiveness and flexibility of the district as a whole.\r\nHowever, some large firms were attempting to develop more innovative strategies and organizational structures, and it was such firms which attempted to build organizations\r\nrepresentative of the interests of the business community in the Potteries. The failure of these attempts allows for further examination of business culture at the level of the industry and district.","bibo:AuthorList":["Popp, Andrew Derek"],"dc:date":"1997-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381926,"sim:weight":0.440649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9636137,"sim:weight":0.356051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383420,"sim:weight":0.337193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.333051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.323263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46760,"sim:weight":0.32074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382094,"sim:weight":0.318391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9845,"sim:weight":0.302864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.296131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44212,"sim:weight":0.291984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98847,"sim:weight":0.284615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.279244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98465,"sim:weight":0.257188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45163,"sim:weight":0.250135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9851,"sim:weight":0.235044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.231228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383675,"sim:weight":0.21204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45264,"sim:weight":0.202215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.201841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71910,"sim:weight":0.196625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The diffusion of water, at ambient temperatures, into PET films, ofthe order of 10 um thick, has been followed using Founer transform infrared attenuated total\r\nreflectance, FT-IR ATR, spectroscopy. Films of differing degrees ofcrystallinity were prepared using two different methods. One method involved the annealing ofthe cast films at 85-90° C for different lengths oftime, to obtain a range of crystallinities. The other method involved the incorporation of different amounts ofan isophthalate group, to obtain a range of crystallinities. The rate of water diffusion with time was then measured as a function of crystallinity. The diffusion was shown to be classically Fickian in nature and the diffusion coefficients decreased\r\nwith increased polymer crystallinity for both sets offilms. The perturbation of the v(OH) band of the water in the polymer matrix was studied as both a function oftime (i.e. concentration) and crystallinity. The water band was shown to be decoupled at low concentrations within the\r\npolymer matrix, indicating a breaking up of the water hydrogen bonding network. At higher concentrations, longer times, the v(OH) band gained more \u0027pure water\u0027 like character, but remained at higher frequency than pure water even at equilibrium water content, suggesting clustering of the water molecules, but an overall weakening ofthe hydrogen bonding network relative to the pure water spectrum.\r\nThe study ofthe interactions ofwater at elevated temperatures including the degradative hydrolysis of PET at 90° C was undertaken using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAlRS). Films of \u003c150 nm were immersed in pure water at 52,62, 70, 80 and 90° C and the effect on the polymeric structure was examined. At temperatures below 90° C the effects noted, on the time scales studied, were annealing effects, resulting in an increase in crystallinity. Estimations ofthe apparent activation energy ofthe gauche to trans isomerisation, for different degrees ofcrystallinity, were calculated and were found to be lower than those reported in the literature in air. This difference was thought to be a result ofthe plasticisation effects of water. At 90° C, during several days of immersion, the polymer was found to undergo hydrolysis.\r\nComplex changes in the RAIRS spectrum were related to changes in the polymeric structure, resulting from degradation. The autocatalytic nature ofthe degradation was highlighted, as was the loss of(small) mobile species from the polymer matrix. Amechanism involving the preferred\r\nsite ofhydrolysis being a terminal ester group was proposed. Comparisons with hot alkaline hydrolysis were made. This occurred much faster and with more random chain scission.\r\nThe diffusion of two organic liquids, methanol and ethylene glycol, into PET was studied. The diffusion was shown to be non-Fickian in nature due to the swelling and crystallisation that accompanied the diffusion. For the amorphous PET films, diffusion was accompanied by swelling and crystallisation for both molecules and was fitted to a dual sorption model. There was spectroscopic evidence for both a \u0027bound\u0027 alcohol- PET moiety and a \u0027free\u0027 alcohol species within the polymer matrix. For methanol in PET, the proportion of the sorbed alcohol which was \u0027bound\u0027 was found to increase with crystallinity, but for ethylene glycol the reverse was true. For methanol diffusion, increasing the crystallinity was shown to have a drastic effect on both the rate of diffusion and degree of swelling. For ethylene glycol diffusion, the degree of crystallinity appeared to affect the rate of swelling and the initial rate of sorption of penetrant, but the rate of\r\nthe subsequent diffusion seemed to be unaffected by morphology.\r\nThe interface between two layers of 20 and 30 um co-extruded PET laminates of PET and PET with an isophthalate comonomer, were examined using confocal Raman microscopy. The methods of confocal depth profiling through the polymer laminate and scanning, step-wise, along a cut edge were compared. The interface was examined using the carbonyl band width ofPET as an indicator of crystallinity. The interface was shown to be 2-3 um thick, independent of film\r\nthickness and contain a gradient of v(C\u003dO) band width, indicating either interdiffusion or a transesterification\r\nreaction between the two polymer layers during co-extrusion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sammon, Christopher"],"dc:date":"1997-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99080,"sim:weight":0.319826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386754,"sim:weight":0.280158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99093,"sim:weight":0.257745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930233,"sim:weight":0.249346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.246598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.235728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98837,"sim:weight":0.225081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26627,"sim:weight":0.218134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98459,"sim:weight":0.216007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99452,"sim:weight":0.211153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99102,"sim:weight":0.209434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98706,"sim:weight":0.208495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.201855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98963,"sim:weight":0.201764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930758,"sim:weight":0.197325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99455,"sim:weight":0.196995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99464,"sim:weight":0.190524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385666,"sim:weight":0.17738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23405,"sim:weight":0.176445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931920,"sim:weight":0.168443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Staffordshire\r\nYeomanry did not disband, as did many cavalry units in 1802 and again in 1815, but its nature changed, so in effect, there were three movements. There were three militias - the regular, supplementary and local militias. The work has concentrated on the procedures for raising, enrolling and financing all the movements. It has considered their service, behaviour, efficiency and their military contribution to the war effort. It has examined the use of corps as posse comitatus and the impact they made on their neighbourhoods or, in the case of the militias, their stations. The period 1793 to 1816 covered the service of the militias and the voluntary movements during the war years. The post-war period, 1815 to 1823, has been concerned with the service of the yeomanry corps and their aid to the civil power, and the voluntary infantry raised between 1819 and 1823. Throughout the work, the relationship between the three movements has been studied, as has their relationship with the army.\r\nThe work has considered the reasons given by government for raising, maintaining and financing such large civilian forces, and how happy the administrations were with so many armed civilians, in war-time, when there was a great fear of Radical activity. It has examined the bureaucracies given the task of administering and controlling the movements and the role played by Whitehall. It has sought to discover what part the civilian movements were expected to play in the event of a French invasion.\r\nFrom 1793 to 1807, considerable legislation was enacted to raise the forces,to alter their status, to give government powers to direct men into voluntary movements, and to rationalise such matters as pay, training and service, so the question of national rather than local movements has been discussed. In the light of increased government involvement in the infantry and yeomanry, the voluntary nature of the two forces has been questioned.\r\nThe militia and the army were generally detested and feared. In the light of this, the thesis has sought to discover why considerable numbers of civilian\u0027s were willing to join voluntary military movements, who they were, and how far they were prepared to accept military discipline and the increased demands made upon them, and their localities, by government as the wars progressed. The great civilian mobilisation, in the form it took, was unique.\r\nNo modem work exists in Staffordshire, or possibly elsewhere, which has undertaken a thorough, comparative study of all three local military associations during the European and Napoleonic Wars and the post-war period to 1823. The work therefore adds to the existing knowledge of civilian movements. It advances the argument that they were social rather than military movements; it defines a continuous link between the early associations, those of mid-Victorian Britain and the Local Defence Volunteers of 1940.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hales, Michael R."],"dc:date":"1995-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":96021,"sim:weight":0.29923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.282731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2923,"sim:weight":0.280372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266688,"sim:weight":0.278615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45371,"sim:weight":0.263979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44647,"sim:weight":0.262254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.243068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383551,"sim:weight":0.237345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18142,"sim:weight":0.23363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.233161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44668,"sim:weight":0.230577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99294,"sim:weight":0.230217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48382,"sim:weight":0.225968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48242,"sim:weight":0.225204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352200,"sim:weight":0.223659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29418,"sim:weight":0.218532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.21463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46875,"sim:weight":0.212963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1544,"sim:weight":0.211434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47545,"sim:weight":0.203331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Various forms of partnership for tourism development in England and elsewhere continue to emerge and evolve in the early years of the 21 st century.\r\nThis study investigates the pre-conditions, processes and outcomes of such partnership arrangements. The study also examines the political, environmental and socio-economic influences that may affect local tourism development partnerships in England. It does so through an integrated conceptual framework that combines theoretical perspectives on resource, and political and institutional considerations in an evaluation of such partnerships. The roles of individual partnership members are also evaluated. This study suggests that the conceptual framework developed for this research may be adopted for the analysis of tourism development partnerships elsewhere.\r\nThis research involves the critical study of partnerships through the integration of both policy studies, and organisation studies perspectives. Theories developed to account for inter-organisational collaboration are given particular prominence in this research. Additionally, theories are also incorporated from political geography, and from institutional theory. It is shown that all of these approaches are relevant and applicable to the study of tourism development partnerships. Theories developed to account for organisational partnerships have been applied to empirical studies in a number of policy, locational and business contexts in recent years. However, there has been comparatively little work that has developed an inter-organisational collaboration theoretical framework in the study of tourism development partnerships. Therefore, this research contributes to knowledge in relation to an emerging and important subject in the field of tourism studies.\r\nThe methodology in this study is qualitative, centring upon an intensive analysis of three local tourism development partnerships, including a pilot study, and involves the use of interviews with key actors and documentary analysis. Theories of interorganisational collaboration inform the research design and analytical framework and contribute towards the development of an integrated theory of partnerships in the context of tourism development. The approach adopted here is transferable to the examination of inter-organisational collaboration and partnerships both within and beyond the field of tourism. Therefore, the methodology developed for this research has considerable potential for substantive application elsewhere. The study concludes with a comparative analysis and evaluation of the findings from the three case studies in this research. The implications of these findings for future research on partnerships are highlighted. The implications of this study for the development of theory and methods for researching tourism development partnerships are also suggested.","bibo:AuthorList":["Long, Philip E."],"dc:date":"2002-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":71717,"sim:weight":0.474651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.453221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387163,"sim:weight":0.332853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46640,"sim:weight":0.314711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47013,"sim:weight":0.313392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336617,"sim:weight":0.28792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.266569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.263513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46821,"sim:weight":0.263222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44343,"sim:weight":0.257044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45170,"sim:weight":0.251693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.242019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.239588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.211637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.208997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383613,"sim:weight":0.1989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.187138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.17922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.169621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3206,"sim:weight":0.16863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, it suggests there is a need to re-think the status of film experiencers as informants who are participant in rather than objects of study, and that an ethnographic approach should be taken to narrow the gap between film studies and film experiencers.\r\nInitially, I investigate ways in which film \"viewers\" and \"audiences\" have been and continue to be theorized, analyzed and represented, with emphases both on how film theory and criticism have treated film experiencers, and on the impact of the recent \"ethnographic turn\" in film and cultural studies. I then investigate pertinent ethnographic theories and methods in the context of recent debates about knowledge production and reflexivity, looking particularly at postmodern and anti-patriarchal critiques. I also consider the relationship between ethnography and cultural studies, and how both these areas impact on the study of film experiencers.\r\nUltimately I suggest particular ways in which ethnographic theories and methods might be used in film studies to inform investigations, understandings and therefore representations of film experiencers. I outline and consider how my case study uses such approaches before setting out the case study itself.\r\nThe case study sets out what sixty-seven participant-informants had to say and write about martial arts action films, and is in large part intended to \"give voice\" to film experiencers.

A study of four psychiatric settings.","bibo:abstract":"Risk management has become one of the major issues facing nurses. Its role in healthcare organisations has gained increased recognition as the consequences of risky decisions have become more visible. The project was primarily concerned with exploring issues that confront one particularly group of professionals - psychiatric nurses - as they experience a particular approach to risk management. \r\nThe study used the advancement of the risk management agenda as an opportunity to examine the nature of risk management and consider what nurses understood to be the nature of a proficient risk management. Case studies analyses were provided of four psychiatric units. Data were collected over four years through observation, interviews and documents. It used an integrated approach to examine the development of risk management processes in its social, environmental and clinical contexts. Drawing on sociological theories of risk, it introduced the theoretical framework of arena concept and explained how this concept affect the decision making process. It was suggested that the decision making process is a social process in which regulative, normative and institutional effects influence the perceptions and management of risk. The processes were shown to involve a dynamic interweaving of certain structured interests mixing with both clinical and societal considerations inside and outside the healthcare settings. Risk was considered to be the outcome of a complex process of social construction comprising of cultural and political elements in which both the influence of institutions and individual evaluation can be discerned. The findings showed that psychiatric nurses presented a creative and critical understanding to the issues involved in risk management by adopting and absorbing new approaches to risk management in order to advance their professional work. This study formulates a new conceptual framework of understanding risk management in organisational context and contributes by drawing together previously unrelated research and shows how it provides the basis for a theoretical model risk management that is more complete.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nmeterson, Nathaniel Martey"],"dc:date":"2003-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48414,"sim:weight":0.398889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18052,"sim:weight":0.354784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.321463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.315031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.292659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.285563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.274102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.271786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.259895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.259115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.25866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.257467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.257297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381947,"sim:weight":0.256757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5941,"sim:weight":0.23711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.23122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50121,"sim:weight":0.230167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48298,"sim:weight":0.22096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2887,"sim:weight":0.216085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46640,"sim:weight":0.215703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

D. Leavis as a threat to the \u0027sensitive minority\u0027; he was prolific.\r\nHis 68 novels from 1903-1950 thus give the cultural historian the unusual opportunity of tracing the development of an author\u0027s attempts to protect both himself and his readers from a process of cultural devaluation. After 1925, the best-selling Sorrell and Son and its immediate successors established \u0027a\u0027 Deeping as a product about which both admirers and detractors had certain expectations. Deeping\u0027s response to these expectations provide an exemplary site within which to examine how certain cultural distinctions were being negotiated and contested in England between the wars.\r\nMy introduction traces the genealogy of my theoretical approach. The theories of Pierre Bourdieu have informed my understanding of the ways in which any expression of taste reflects the class positioning of the consumer. However these theories are concerned chiefly with patterns of consumption. They do not account adequately for the generation of texts in response to perceived cultural hierarchies. Deeping\u0027s texts are increasingly explicit in the ways they dramatise their own questionable cultural status. I use this self-consciousness to test the limits of the usefulness of available theories of cultural production. \r\nMy first chapter historicises the emergence of the term \u0027middlebrow\u0027, using the contrast between its use on either side of the Atlantic to demonstrate the necessity of placing its use in a particular class and cultural context. My second chapter, therefore, is a short account of Deeping\u0027s own class positioning, focusing on the way in which his biographical constructions marketed the writer of popular fiction. My third chapter examines how his first twenty novels dramatise the kind of fiction that Deeping thought himself to be writing before the term \u0027middlebrow\u0027 had currency. My fourth chapter examines the group of novels, preceding Sorrell and Son, in which the writer is depicted as feminised and declassified. My fifth chapter concerns the nature of the extraordinary success of Sorrell and Son and what this implies about the gendered cultural and class positions both of Deeping and his loyal readers. My final chapter deals with the animosity to which Sorrell\u0027s success exposed the culturally beleaguered Deeping and with how consciousness of this animosity shaped his later novels.\r\nMy thesis seeks to demonstrate that the way cultural hierarchies are established shapes the nature of the products generated. Although commentators on mass culture have stressed the homogenous identity of popular texts, the mechanical nature of their production and the passivity of their consumers, Deeping\u0027s novels imply readers aware of and resistant to such characterisations. Q. D. Leavis identified this resistance, but she and other self-appointed members of the cultural elite, failed to recognise that the \u0027game\u0027 of drawing cultural distinctions blunted the exercise of the very quality on which the self-appointed umpires based their claim to cultural superiority: moral intelligence and discrimination. In a similar way commentators on the left, anxious to assert their affiliations with the working class, were only able to register the petit-bourgeois \u0027image\u0027 of Deeping\u0027s work from which they wished to distance themselves. They therefore failed to perceive that it is, amongst many other things, about class images. The project aims to encourage a greater attention to the particularity of cultural commodities consumed by the lower middle classes in the 1920s and 1930s.","bibo:AuthorList":["Grover, Mary"],"dc:date":"2002-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1384230,"sim:weight":0.281368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44084,"sim:weight":0.241127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.237957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.230332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387221,"sim:weight":0.228038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18048,"sim:weight":0.226685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.225407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.225232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48296,"sim:weight":0.224888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.222765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.222239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88939,"sim:weight":0.221489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386250,"sim:weight":0.215106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.213967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44647,"sim:weight":0.213644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45273,"sim:weight":0.208528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.207745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46587,"sim:weight":0.19903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.194714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46639,"sim:weight":0.193649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Podiatrists have claimed understanding of shoe wear patterns, associating foot pathologies with characteristic patterns and implying a \"onecondition, one wear pattern\" hypothesis. This project was commenced to understand and clarify this relationship. Round one of an initial Delphi exercise to seek agreements over such wear pattern associations however indicated that, many different patterns could be associated with single named foot pathologies with round three agreements appearing to relate to the most common pattern associations. Analysis of the patterns in the Delphi exercise produced an instrument to describe and compare shoe wear patterns using focal points - points from which areas of shoe wear would spread.\r\nA following survey questionnaire suggested that podiatrists were most familiar with wear patterns associated with four foot pathologies - pronation, hallux rigidus, pes cavus and rearfoot varus. Patterns associated with these pathologies were collected from U. K. podiatrists in a single round questionnaire. Inductive analysis of these patterns from a hermeneutic phenomenological perspective using the focal point concept suggested that if the pathological context is known, wear patterns could be classified on the basis of causative function. A theoretical model was proposed of factors important in wear pattern production, suggesting that primary walking intention (the intended walking function of the foot) was more influential than foot pathologies in wear pattern formation and that \"external\" factors could also influence shoe wear. \r\nValidation and grounding of the focal point concept and model of shoe wear influence was planned, involving paired podiatry observers, to determine whether focal points could clarify, differentiate and show similarities between shoe wear patterns in reality and whether the model of wear influence was justified. To reduce the potential for observer error, two prior exercises were undertaken. A Delphi exercise focused participants on the required task and produced statements for the recognition of variables, which may influence shoe wear patterns. Inter-observer reliability tests demonstrated that clinical observation agreement levels were acceptable for the validation. In the validation, three subjects exhibiting pathologies, including hallux rigidus, and their owned footwear (22 items) were studied. The presence, level and effect of variables potentially influencing the wear patterns present, were determined by paired observations of foot pathologies, shoe fit and function, video analysis of foot function and subject interview for the footwear history. The focal point concept showed similarities and differences between shoe wear patterns, although wear pattern clarity limitations occurred. Within the pathological context the patterns predicted the related functions. The model of wear influence was supported with external influences needing to be major to override primary walking intention and foot pathology effects.\r\nA method to describe and compare shoe wear patterns and a model to explain the link between function and wear, showing the relationship of factors important in wear pattern production have been produced. This model provides an alternative perspective on foot function to that of biomechanical theory and could represent the basis of a new taxonomy for podiatry. This greater understanding of shoe wear patterns should improve their potential value in forensic identification and in clinical diagnosis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vernon, Denis Wesley"],"dc:date":"2000-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"D W Vernon.

It explores discourses of motherhood in this popular cultural form at this particular historical time, using quantitative, semiotic and discourse analyses of selected monthly magazines. Psychoanalytic theories and discourse analysis are employed to explore the construction of figures of motherhood in the text. I have identified the period of the late 1980s and early 1990s as a time of social and economic change and I seek to find out what correlation there might be between images of motherhood\r\nin the magazines and these changes, as illustrated by political rhetoric and empirical evidence of social trends.\r\nThere are two main findings. The first points to the relative absence of motherhood as denoted in the magazines of the late 1980s. Motherhood is subsumed into discourses of femininity, but rarely picked out, suggesting that\r\nmotherhood is an absent presence within the magazines at this time. Motherhood is rarely mentioned but where it is identified, it is either in relation to the \u0027caring\u0027 or the \u0027working\u0027 mother. The second, major finding relates to the emergence of a new figure of motherhood in the 1990s, which builds on the earlier figures of motherhood but presents a significant move away from earlier articulations, especially those which locate motherhood within the domestic arena and within the traditional family. This new figure of the Independent Mother suggests a paradigm shift which challenges the conservative assumptions of traditionalist political rhetoric.","bibo:AuthorList":["Woodward, Kathryn"],"dc:date":"1994-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46638,"sim:weight":0.360847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98713,"sim:weight":0.307067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383660,"sim:weight":0.284718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381940,"sim:weight":0.234253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381919,"sim:weight":0.202397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48296,"sim:weight":0.197096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.191172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930364,"sim:weight":0.18977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47200,"sim:weight":0.187451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383575,"sim:weight":0.18354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.179197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9432766,"sim:weight":0.179041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16699,"sim:weight":0.172256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2884,"sim:weight":0.167258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45520,"sim:weight":0.166181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47213,"sim:weight":0.166178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18068,"sim:weight":0.163687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382089,"sim:weight":0.159169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383352,"sim:weight":0.158944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.158668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These sites were set up in 1989 by the Department of Health as centres of excellence for the implementation of TQM. An earlier study\u0027 evaluating TQM in the NHS failed to adequately contextualise the reasons for the argument that orthodox TQM has failed in the NHS. Against this background, it became necessary to carry out an extensive reassessment of TQM initiatives in the NHS. The central thrust of the study involves the identification of: i.the differing modes of implementation of TQM across the sites; ii.the difficulties managers were encountering in the implementation of TQM - barriers to the implementation of TQM; iii.the critical key success factors for the successful implementation of TQM in theNHS; and, iv.based on empirical evidence seeks to determine whether a specific model of TQM is required in the NHS.\r\nAs Francis Bacon noted, \u0027if anyone wants to understand nature, he has to study nature rather than base their understanding on Aristotle\u0027s postulations of nature. This is because Aristotle did not understand nature, his ideas about nature were not empirically determined\u00272 Hence, to gain a conceptual understanding of TQM, it is necessary to understand \u0027implementation\u0027 and not base understanding on the outmoded ideas of the Gurus, whose philosophies are not grounded in empirical data. Thus, the TQM literature is inundated with TQM models that are based on anecdotal evidence and the personal prescriptions of TQM writers\u0027. This situation has led to a call by a number of writers\u0027 for an empirically determined implementation model for TQM; particularly in the healthcare setting. To determine whether such a model is required in the NHS, this exploratory study used a unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data to sample 23 Quality Managers at the 23 TQM sites in order to provide an accurate rendition of the TQM process in the NHS. The study makes a valid contribution to the quality literature, by contending that TQM has not failed in the NHS as earlier suggested by one stud?, but is yet to be tried. Allegations of failure arise from improper implementation, which is itself symptomatic of the lack of a context-specific model for the implementation of TQM in the NHS. The conclusion was reached from a number of perspectives: (1) the critique of current TQM literature which is based on the personal ideas of quality management proponents (Chapter Three). (2) a reconceptualisation of the implementation of TQM. The study suggests that the traditional paradigms of TQM lack adequate contextualisation. They only provide answers for the \"what\" of TQM in the form of step-by-step approaches, or of TQM as a vehicle for culture change, without providing the practising manager with the \u0027how\u0027 of the implementation process. This apparent limitation, the author suggests, makes TQM orthodoxy inappropriate to deal with the complexities of the NHS (Chapter Four). (3) the study also found that the suggestions in the literature that the barriers to the implementation of TQM have generic applicability across organisations is a misnomer. In most of the hospitals the difficulties that quality managers were facing were specific to the organisational context (Chapter Five). (4) seventeen critical success factors were identified as valid and specific to the NHS. These factors, unlike the \u0027Ten Critical Success Factors\u0027 identified by Black6 are of equal importance for the implementation of TQM and are not categorised on a scale of importance (Chapter Seven).\r\nIn the final analysis, the study, as a major contribution to knowledge in the quality management field, provides the first empirically determined context specific model for the implementation of TQM in the NHS. The model represents the first problem specific model validated by the experiences of fifteen quality managers in the NHS. It provides an empirical understanding of the \u0027nature\u0027 of the implementation of TQM within the confines of the British National Health Service. In addition, a measurement framework to monitor the progress of TQM at various stages of the implementation process is offered (Chapter Seven).","bibo:AuthorList":["Nwabueze, Uche"],"dc:date":"1995-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48275,"sim:weight":0.716986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44441,"sim:weight":0.193637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.176601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.16198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46637,"sim:weight":0.154343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.150232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.149557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.148053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.147984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.144044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48424,"sim:weight":0.142017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99123,"sim:weight":0.131161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383451,"sim:weight":0.128249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271238,"sim:weight":0.128209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3198,"sim:weight":0.126202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.123886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.122634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.12219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.12037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3206,"sim:weight":0.116369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The central focus is the experience of making meaning in academic writing of ten women students with whom I met on an individual basis over a period of between 1 and 3 years to talk about specific instances of their writing for undergraduate course work. Most of the study reported here is based on discussions of their academic writing at first year undergraduate level.\r\nIn exploring the student-writers\u0027 experience my analysis has been significantly informed by the following writers and notions: Fairclough\u0027s three levelled framework for analyzing the production and interpretation of texts which builds on Halliday\u0027s contexts of situation and culture (see Halliday 1978; Fairclough 1989, 1992a); the work of Clark and Ivanic on critical language awareness about academic writing (see for example Clark and Ivanic 1991); the work of Ivanic on social identity and authorship in student academic writing (1993; 1998); the notion of literacy practices as developed by a number of writers (Street 1993; Barton 1994) and in particular the notion of essayist literacy (Scollon and Scollon 1981; Gee 1996); Bakhtin\u0027s dialogic notion of language and, in particular, the significance he attaches to addressivity in, and for, meaning making (1981).\r\nThe central argument in this thesis is that any exploration of students\u0027 writing at university should be premised on a view of student-writers as meaning makers.

In relation to methodology, I argue for the centrality of dialogue and present a methodological framework for constructing this dialogue. In relation to the student-writers\u0027 experience of meaning making, I argue the following specific points:\r\ni.The demands surrounding student academic writing are embedded in an institutional practice of mystery. This practice of mystery is ideologically inscribed in that it works against those least familiar with the conventions surrounding academic writing, limiting their participation in higher education as currently configured.\r\nii.Although the conventions surrounding student academic writing remain implicit, they constitute a particular literacy practice, essayist literacy, which is privileged within the university. The conventions of this practice work towards regulating individual student meaning making in specific ways.\r\niii.The type of student/tutor addressivity surrounding student meaning making in academic writing significantly contributes to both the nature of the students\u0027 possible participation in HE and to the meanings that they make.\r\nI end by discussing the pedagogical implications of the arguments made in the study.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lillis, Theresa"],"dc:date":"1998-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4355,"sim:weight":0.502138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81937,"sim:weight":0.489654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12367,"sim:weight":0.481427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48418,"sim:weight":0.42733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99108,"sim:weight":0.350929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48421,"sim:weight":0.33344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17991,"sim:weight":0.32475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383540,"sim:weight":0.315379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.313616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.310056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48279,"sim:weight":0.302749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2840,"sim:weight":0.299435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41347,"sim:weight":0.296214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88939,"sim:weight":0.295861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98881,"sim:weight":0.291126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16185,"sim:weight":0.289928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.2815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3218,"sim:weight":0.278778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44958,"sim:weight":0.275731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":744299,"sim:weight":0.26653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In brief, the students\u0027 accounts of group work were characterised by several main themes: the issue of control and influence over others (which the role of \u0027student\u0027 was perceived to limit); the reciprocal nature of group work with its potential to influence grades; the public nature of group work through which the students presented themselves to others and the discrepancies which were revealed in group work between different ways of working.\r\nThe discussion places the student firmly within the learning milieu that they create as students on a particular degree course. In doing so it provides a socia-interpretive explanation of development and transfer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Neath, Mark"],"dc:date":"1998","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.491339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17991,"sim:weight":0.452397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.451957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16185,"sim:weight":0.438974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9631121,"sim:weight":0.433064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41233,"sim:weight":0.427659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99108,"sim:weight":0.407758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26502,"sim:weight":0.404957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.404085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.401129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.393156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.392667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.385836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2820,"sim:weight":0.381528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.370757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98881,"sim:weight":0.366777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48279,"sim:weight":0.366251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.364967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.361612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.359934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":293451,"ep:Repository":102,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Adhesive bonding of stainless steel : strength and durability","bibo:abstract":"Adhesive bonding as an alternative method of joining materials together has many advantages over the more conventional joining methods such as fusion and spot welding, bolting and riveting. For example, adhesives can be used to bond dissimilar materials, adhesive joints have a high stiffness to weight ratio and the stress distribution within the joint is much improved. Stainless steels are commonly used in applications that would clearly benefit from adhesive bonding; architectural cladding, because of the large bond areas involved, and in the railway industry, due to improved acoustic insulation and greater fatigue resistance. The work presented in this thesis is concerned with adhesive bonding of stainless steels intended for structural applications.\r\nAs a starting point to the investigation, a review of the literature was conducted, covering the intrinsic mechanisms of adhesion, the significance of the chemical and physical nature of the adherend surface, the types of structural adhesives, the methods of testing adhesive joints and surface characterisation techniques. The first experimental stage, involved a screening programme to evaluate a number of candidate adhesive systems and adherend surface pre-treatments. Standard single overlap shear and floating roller peel tests conducted in ambient conditions were employed in the discrimination and the degree of compatibility between adhesive and adherend, as measured by the proportion of cohesive failure on the post-fracture face, was also considered. In the second stage of the experimental work, lap shear tests were used to evaluate the affects of surface contamination on joint strength. In addition, lap shear and peel tests were considered to assess the significance of the adhesive bondline and primer thickness. In order to assess the environmental durability of adhesive joints, lap shear and peel tests were conducted after ageing in ambient and high humidity environments. To compliment the data, Boeing wedge crack extension tests were also carried out on adhesive bonded joints incorporating adherends with different surface conditions, to investigate the contribution to joint strength in ambient and adverse environments afforded by surface pre-treatment. The next stage of the experimental work was designed to evaluate the significance of the adherend type and its thickness on initial lap shear strength. Several different commercial grades and gauges of stainless steel were used in the tests, which were conducted at room temperature. The final stage of the experimental work was concentrated on the room temperature creep and dynamic fatigue performance of adhesive joints. Throughout the course of study a number of different surface analytical techniques were employed to physically and chemically characterise the surfaces of pm-bonded adherends and to identify the locus of failure on post-fracture faces.\r\nThe single overlap shear and floating roller peel tests were able to differentiate between the candidate adhesives; epoxy systems, particularly the toughened variants, were considered the most suitable structural adhesives for bonding stainless steels in load bearing applications. However, these tests and subsequent tests using lap shear and peel, failed to discriminate conclusively between the different surface pre-treatments (except untreated or crudely prepared surfaces) and ageing environments. The Boeing wedge crack extension tests were found to be sensitive to the condition of the adherend surface and the environment in which the joint is located; roughening the surface of the adherend either chemically or physically was found to enhance joint durability in ambient, high humidity and sub-zero environments. The use of surface primers and coupling agents may protect the un-bonded surface and benefit joint durability, but excessively thick primer layers may reduce joint strength. The stiffness of the adherend material was found to significantly influence lap shear strength. Stiffer adherends, either thicker or inherently stronger, give higher joint strengths because they resist joint rotation and the peel stresses at the extremes of the overlap are minimised. Lap joints with low stiffness adherends will fail by peel-dominated, adherend-controlled failure and lap joints with high stiffness adherends will fail by shear-dominated, adhesive-controlled failure. Two elastic models were proposed for determining the elastic rotation and the line peel force as a function of the shear stress. The room temperature creep results showed an endurance limit of -40% mean static failure load (design load \u003d 250 N.mni1 ). The dynamic fatigue results were favourable compared to those of spot welded and weldbonded joints and an endurance limit of 40% mean static failure load (design load \u003d 250 N.mm-1 ) was observed. Finally, leaving the hard fillets of cured adhesive squeeze-out, intact at the extremes of the overlap, will reinforce the joint and minimise the rotation-induced peel stresses that will lead to premature failure when the adherend plastically deforms under static or dynamic loading.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boyes, Robert"],"dc:date":"1998-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.590339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26504,"sim:weight":0.50875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387824,"sim:weight":0.508512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.502581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383476,"sim:weight":0.346351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99041,"sim:weight":0.239502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98934,"sim:weight":0.227317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98541,"sim:weight":0.211907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99089,"sim:weight":0.206212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387311,"sim:weight":0.202243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27120,"sim:weight":0.196408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.187349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98825,"sim:weight":0.186791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27903,"sim:weight":0.184984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27099,"sim:weight":0.18491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.184352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27098,"sim:weight":0.182358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44469,"sim:weight":0.180908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17943,"sim:weight":0.175467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386814,"sim:weight":0.165567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It examines the basic chemistry of the atmosphere and the roles that organic compounds play in it. Also investigated are the methods of sampling and analysing the volatile organic compounds in the air, paying particular attention to the role of solid phase sampling. Chapter 1 also examines the role of volatile organic compounds on air quality.\r\nChapter 2 describes the experimental procedures that were employed during the course of this research project.\r\nChapter 3 examines a multi-method approach to the study of volatile organic compounds in urban and indoor air. The methods employed were capillary electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography. Although good results were obtained for the various methods that were investigated Chapter 3 concludes that a more unified analytical approach is needed to the study of the air.\r\nChapter 4 investigates the possibilities of using a unified approach to the study of VOC\u0027s. This is achieved by the development of an air sampling method that uses solid phase extraction cartridges. By investigating many aspects of air sampling mechanisms the results show that a simple yet efficient method for the sampling of VOC in air has been developed. The SPE method is a reusable, yet reliable method that by using sequential solvent desorption has been shown to exhibit some degree of selectivity. The solid phase that gave the best results was styrene-divinyl benzene however other phases were also investigated.\r\nThe use of a single gas chromatography method was also investigated for the purpose of confirmatory identification of the VOC\u0027s. Various detection systems were used including MS and AED. It was shown that by optimising the GC\u0027s it was possible to get complimentary results.\r\nAlso investigated was the possibility of compound tagging in an attempt to confirm the identity of several of the compounds found in the air.\r\nChapter 5 is a theoretical discussion of the ways presenting the data obtained experimentally in an easy to understand way. Instead of targeting 7 or 8 compounds as being representative of air quality it is argued that by using a technique such as Air Fingerprinting, it is possible to show data that is indicative of the whole air sample. Using actual data it is possible to show the origin of the air sample in a simple yet effective way using air fingerprints.\r\nAlso discussed is the Individual Component Air Quality Index, this is a method of quantifying air quality. By taking into account compound toxicity, atmospheric lifetime and UV exposure, the ICAQI, it is argued, is a technique that presents a more accurate picture of air quality.\r\nChapter 6 concludes the thesis by drawing together the themes and issues that were raised.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clarkson, Paul Jonathan"],"dc:date":"1998-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":63741,"sim:weight":0.390782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.331312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337831,"sim:weight":0.25695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000990,"sim:weight":0.249798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3158,"sim:weight":0.246673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.238393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.238393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826655,"sim:weight":0.233311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.222112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.217475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23056,"sim:weight":0.207929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9837,"sim:weight":0.203779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3061,"sim:weight":0.202992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.192453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.190817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000105,"sim:weight":0.187479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.183504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46534,"sim:weight":0.168233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":692523,"sim:weight":0.161447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.154003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It seeks to identify the key aspects of what constitutes \"learning accounting\" and \"teaching accounting\" for lecturers and students, their conceptions of accounting and the extent to which students and lecturers share experiences in common or differ in their experiences. The research method adopted is that of phenomenography which seeks to identify the qualitatively different ways in which various phenomena are experienced.\r\nSince there has been relatively little critique of the practice of phenomenography, this study also seeks to critically review the application of the phenomenographic research method in practice. This review draws on experience within empirically-based phenomenological psychology to propose a revised phenomenographic research approach. This revised approach focuses on the need to bracket presuppositions about the phenomenon under investigation, to develop an empathetic understanding with the experiences of the participants and to report findings in a way which would most fully reveal the nature of that lived experience.\r\nThrough the application of this revised research approach key aspects of the individual, common and distinctive worlds of students and lecturers are identified. \"Learning accounting\" and \"teaching accounting\" are shown, primarily, to constitute the learning of a technique. Yet this emphasis on accounting as the learning of a technique is at variance with other teaching objectives perceived by lecturers to be equally, or more, important. Lecturers perceive the development of conceptual understanding to be of importance. However, they express diverse views about what \"accounting\" is, they are doubtful about the relationship between conceptual understanding and the learning of the technique and their explanations of accounting concepts often reveal a partial and, arguably incomplete, conceptual framework. In addition, the findings show that students\u0027 preconceptions and perceptions of relevance are central to their experience of learning accounting and they reinforce the experience of accounting as being about the learning of a technique. Lecturers\u0027 perceptions of those preconceptions and relevance reveal teaching responses based on misunderstandings of the students\u0027 experiences. An alternative way of viewing the introductory accounting curriculum is proposed which takes into account the ways in which students and lecturers experience the learning and teaching of accounting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lucas, Ursula"],"dc:date":"1998-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26502,"sim:weight":0.44449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.433434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17991,"sim:weight":0.393653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1560,"sim:weight":0.379622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18956,"sim:weight":0.370581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.36875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4132,"sim:weight":0.349647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2820,"sim:weight":0.349594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16185,"sim:weight":0.331259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.325686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.322348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.311042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.30823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99108,"sim:weight":0.305855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.303869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.296352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.289521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47006,"sim:weight":0.284166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.282881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18068,"sim:weight":0.277133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

XRD, microscopy, EDX and GDOES on coatings having different thicknesses and deposited on different substrates.\r\nThe work has confirmed and extended the ideas of Finch et al. (2, 51), Piontelli et al. (3) and Pangarov (49.120, 121) applicable to alloy deposition. It has shown that a better understanding, particularly of the initial deposition stages, can be obtained by considering crystallographic, energy and electrochemical aspects in combination rather than individually.\r\nInitially alloy is deposited on a `foreign\u0027 substrate but subsequently the growing alloy itself serves as the `substrate\u0027. Similarly `old\u0027 crystallites have to compete for growth with `newly\u0027 nucleated ones as the deposit develops. The three stages of growth observed in nickel-iron and nickel-zinc are discussed.\r\nCrystallographic strain, resulting from mismatch between substrate and deposit structures and the presence of impurities, along with the energies required to produce different structures are considered to play a major role in determining structure during alloy deposition.\r\nCompetition for discharge between hydrogen and metallic ions at the changing deposit surface, including changes in its electrochemical nature are considered. In addition possible effects resulting from adsorbed species, including co-discharged hydrogen as well as other species such as hydroxyl ions or precipitated hydroxides are discussed.\r\nWhereas during initial nucleation the original substrate is the dominating influence, in the later stages the electrolytic parameters determine the structure of the deposit. If the structure of the outer deposit differs markedly from that of the deposit during the initial stages, then a transitional growth stage may be involved. The structures of deposits studied in the present work tended to be fine grained in the initial stages but developed coarser columnar structures due to selected grain growth with favoured grains becoming broader during the intermediate and final stages of growth.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lehmberg, Claudia Erdmuthe"],"dc:date":"1998-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":840049,"sim:weight":0.249517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269885,"sim:weight":0.249513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22904,"sim:weight":0.242721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26445,"sim:weight":0.220078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44753,"sim:weight":0.219282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46257,"sim:weight":0.219037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268783,"sim:weight":0.21854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44848,"sim:weight":0.190644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99344,"sim:weight":0.190123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45651,"sim:weight":0.187656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99484,"sim:weight":0.184683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381908,"sim:weight":0.183999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31313,"sim:weight":0.176661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387415,"sim:weight":0.171776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98963,"sim:weight":0.169392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386703,"sim:weight":0.161316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98911,"sim:weight":0.156464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573684,"sim:weight":0.149195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387377,"sim:weight":0.135223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18118,"sim:weight":0.129014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Apart from a few accounts of extraordinary feats, which counter the generalisations about midlife women, for example, a 76 year old grandmother going sky-diving, there is very little written about midlife women living enjoyable, independent lives. This work presents a detailed analyses of the way in which thirty women have been able to, or are in the process of, actively structuring an enjoyable midlife.\r\nPrevious research has tended to view aspects of women\u0027s lives in isolation, such as leisure, body, health, or work. The artificial boundaries that have arisen because of this separation reinforce societal notions of fragmentation within social life. This research was designed to challenge these divisions and, by investigating women\u0027s enjoyable experiences, to develop concepts that are common across the composition of these women\u0027s lives.\r\nA feminist phenomenological methodology was used and semi-structured in-depth interviews were undertaken to access women\u0027s lived experience of enjoyment, their lifeworld, and also to determine participants understanding of the concept of leisure and their experience of menopause. All interviews were transcribed and subjected to a systematic content analysis, as advocated by phenomenological research practitioners. \r\nThe findings contradict the predominantly negative popular images of midlife women and show that most of the women in the study are in the act of resisting the earlier views of women and ageing. Their responses also indicate they tend not to recognise the fragmentation of their lives into work, leisure and health issues, but rather regard their lives as \u0027all together and not separated out\u0027. An enjoyable lifeworld means being regarded as an individual and independent person and having \u0027a sense of being in charge\u0027, over their own time and space, making opportunities for physical, social, creative and intellectual activity, as well as preparing for the future.\r\nThe thesis concludes with a discussion of how midlife women are creating enjoyable lifestyles.

Firstly, it is considered in relation to the historical roots of horror fiction, the tradition of the literary Gothic which stretches back as far as the late eighteenth century. The same chapter elaborates the broad outline of a methodology, drawing upon an established body of genre theory in both literary and film studies, which is then applied to the gradual diffusion of the Gothic legacy into the related genres of detective stories/thrillers, horror, and science-fiction, the inter-relatedness of these three genres forming part of the cultural context for modern horror. Chapter 3 considers Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s Psycho (1960) in relation to the structures and iconography of the original Gothic, and in the light of its fusion of conventions drawn from the horror film and the thriller. Chapter 4 compares this film with a similarly influential movie - Halloween - made almost two decades later, assessing some of the changes which the genre has undergone in the intervening period. The following five chapters (5-9) discuss a number of films of the period 1968 - 80, paying particular attention to works that have figured prominently in the established critical literarure around the genre, both as an appraisal of existing approaches and as an indication of the immediate context for developments over the last decade.  The remaining four chapters (10 - 13) consider some developments of the 1980\u0027s, disputing the critical construction of the \"body horror\" category and providing an account of the horror-comedies which have generally been neglected by critics. The conclusion involves a synthesis of the material covered and a return to the Gothic tradition in order to conceptually situate the findings. There is an extensive biblography involving a variety of material ranging from popular magazines and newspapers to influential academic works, drawn more or less equally from the fields of literary criticism and film studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rogers, Alan"],"dc:date":"1990-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382086,"sim:weight":0.492076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46824,"sim:weight":0.372757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47288,"sim:weight":0.309029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99117,"sim:weight":0.305188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.286354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.276509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44743,"sim:weight":0.273917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45332,"sim:weight":0.268381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18048,"sim:weight":0.265432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99510,"sim:weight":0.263391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352166,"sim:weight":0.259343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.258185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.246927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382483,"sim:weight":0.241361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98742,"sim:weight":0.23303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47198,"sim:weight":0.230061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98567,"sim:weight":0.224726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88939,"sim:weight":0.219259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.19973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.196065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Local tourism development groups existed for a century or more before recent notions of community involvement in visitor industry initiatives came to prominence as part of the debate about \u0027green\u0027 tourism, and the study represents the first in-depth investigation of these groups, aimed at offering some guidance for the community tourism organisations advocated by several tourism authors. Guided by systems analysis methodology, the study presents original data on the nature and role of TM and develops theoretical consideration of such groups. Based upon these contributions to understanding, a critical assessment of the potential contribution of TM towards the development of small-scale local visitor industries as part of the local economies in qualitative terms is made.\r\n\r\nA review of relevant literature establishes that government policy has sought to develop tourism as a component of local economies in urban and rural areas. The sparse literature on tourism associations generally ascribes them lower-order publicity roles rather than the developmental functions that they could perhaps more usefully fulfil. Visitors represent a major economic opportunity for local communities, and economic multiplier studies show that local economies could benefit from becoming more visitor-oriented. However, relatively few areas benefit from conventional tourism development initiatives, particularly in the countryside, and voluntary effort may be necessary for communities to capitalise upon the visitor market.\r\n\r\nA postal questionnaire survey of a large sample of tourism associations in England and Wales established that these groups exist as a response to a perception of need for such organisations. During the 1970s and \u002780s there was a surge in the formation rate of TM. They were found to vary in many respects but shared common characteristics, and were classified into four basic types. While most members were businesses, many had representatives from the public sector and other organisations in membership. They undertook a broad range of useful activities, and certain public sector bodies provide financial assistance for aspects of their work. Some operated mainly as trade associations, but there are grounds for regarding all as community tourism groups to some degree. Measures of sophistication based upon the survey data and analyses are proposed, but the level of sophistication appropriate for any individual group depends upon local circumstances.\r\n\r\nAn interview-based case study of four TAs working in rural Herefordshire reflected and validated many of the questionnaire survey conclusions. Each group had different approaches and priorities, particularly regarding the relative balance struck between promotion and development of the south Herefordshire visitor industry. They worked alongside tourism-oriented public sector bodies to varying degrees, and some received financial assistance for certain activities. While quantification of the effects that the TAs had on the visitor industry proved impossible, interviewees\u0027 opinions indicated that the work of the groups was valuable and that, without them, the contribution of the visitor industry to the local economy would be reduced.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the data collection stages showed that the goals of tourism associations are essentially the same as those of the more formal elements of the tourism development system, with marketing as a key focus. The work of TM can produce positive economic benefits for local economies in urban, coastal and rural locations. Recommendations for best practice are made for the associations and their roles, and the public sector is urged to help establish and help support TM. Conclusions drawn are that tourism associations have a valuable developmental role to play alongside their publicity function, and that the broad-membership association type is probably more appropriate for visitor industry development in lesser-known areas than sectoral types.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stone, Chris"],"dc:date":"1994-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.605179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.268325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.24754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109246,"sim:weight":0.243916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.234138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.22873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.225624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.223184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.204826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.197748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9847,"sim:weight":0.193212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382913,"sim:weight":0.189494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.180183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.17824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67025,"sim:weight":0.177762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41233,"sim:weight":0.176185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.169833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3533,"sim:weight":0.169684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.167777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.161612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The implications of this can clearly be seen in the vast number of stress management programmes which have emerged during this time. Typically, these programmes consist of a number of cognitive-behavioural techniques which aim to reduce the individual\u0027s psychological and/or physiological symptoms of stress, eliminate or modify the stressor, or to change the cognitive appraisal of the stressor.\r\n\r\nDespite the plethora of stress management programmes in the commercial market, very little research has focused on determining the effectiveness of such packages. Furthermore, much of the research which has been undertaken has been methodologically flawed. This has probably occurred as a result of the researchers\u0027 failure to consider theoretical approaches towards the evaluative area of stress management intervention. Consequently, those models of stress management intervention which have been proposed have generally lacked empirical support.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the present study were to implement and evaluate a stress management intervention using a balanced and controlled design. The author intended to maximise its effectiveness by running the programme over five weeks, a period considerably longer than many interventions, using the expertise of a qualified psychologist and physiotherapist. Thirty-four members of staff from Sheffield Hallam University volunteered to take part in the interventions, with thirty-one members of staff acting as control subjects. All participants, both experimental and control, were from the academic, administrative and technical sectors of the University. The intervention consisted of sessions on the theory of stress and its consequences, relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, assertiveness training and time management.\r\n\r\nThe programme was evaluated in the short-term using the participants\u0027 scores on a number of standardised psychological tests and self-designed evaluative questionnaires, together with the participants\u0027 blood pressure readings. A four-month follow-up was also included into the design of the research.\r\n\r\nConsideration of the results from this study, together with criticisms of previous theoretical approaches to stress management interventions, led the author to design a Process Model of stress management intervention. This model focused on the short- and long-term outcomes of an intervention, and on the individual and their specific needs. A single-case study approach to stress management, using qualitative and quantitative research methods, was used to empirically test the Process Model. The author argued that the results from this study supported her model, and suggested that the model be used in the design of future evaluative studies of stress management intervention.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barlow, Claire A."],"dc:date":"1995","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5941,"sim:weight":0.520412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22782,"sim:weight":0.291457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46759,"sim:weight":0.28573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99436,"sim:weight":0.282521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50121,"sim:weight":0.273583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.261675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3349,"sim:weight":0.260621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.260159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.257925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.254927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.245472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.243851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25931,"sim:weight":0.226529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.220405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.214839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3206,"sim:weight":0.208109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.204148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.20273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2837,"sim:weight":0.191889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.186611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, asbestos is now recognised as a carcinogenic material.\r\nTherefore, asbestos removal is being widely undertaken. But the hazards increase at this stage as the material is disturbed. Dry removal was found to be an exhausting operation producing a high concentration of fibres. The spraying or injection of wetting agent into the material reduces the hazard associated with the removal process by aggregating the fibres together. The airborne concentration of fibres is then considerably reduced.\r\nRaman microspectroscopy has been shown to be a very powerful technique for the identification of micrometer-sized fibres and particles, with little or no sample preparation. Such spectra are sensitive to the composition of the material and can often be used to distinguish between similar species. Raman microscopy also provides important information about surface coverage of such materials with a spatial resolution between 2 and 4 um.\r\nRaman spectra were obtained from five asbestos reference standards in comparison with four non-fibrous analogues. The different species such as amosite, anthophyllite, chrysotile, crocidolite and tremolite gave distinct spectra. There were no very distinct differences between the spectra of asbestos fibres and their non-fibrous forms except sometimes in the v(OH) stretching region or band width in the case of tremolite. The reference spectra have been used for identification of known and unknown (industrial samples) fibres on cellulose filters. Moreover, other inorganic particles on cellulose filters have been identified.\r\nThe discrimination between pure diesel and coal particles on quartz filters and the identification of gunshot residues on paper substrates were also successfully achieved. The coverage of wetting agents on the surface of inorganic fibres connected with asbestos removal operations have been also investigated. Basic laboratory experiments were undertaken. Several inorganic fibres such as man made and asbestos fibres as well as calcium silicate were wetted using different processes: spraying, dipping and capillary\r\nadsorption in order to measure the distribution of wetting agents on individual fibres. Insulation materials, usually composed of calcium silicate and asbestos fibres from\r\nasbestos removal sites, were collected and also analysed by Raman microspectroscopy.

This high performance grade of stainless steel was heat treated to three commercially available material specifications, namely the peak hardened, standard and softened overaged conditions. These three precipitation hardened conditions\r\nwere found to exhibit a range of tensile properties. In order to determine the role of the microstructure, a full materials characterisation programme was performed.\r\nThe investigative techniques used to characterize the microstructures, were Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM); Analytical Scanning Electron Microscopy (ASEM); optical microscopy; dilatometry and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The microstructural phases and features identified were measured and quantified wherever possible.\r\nThe effect of the material microstructure and environment on the fatigue properties of FV520B have been investigated. Fatigue tests were performed under uniaxial loading conditions at a stress ratio R (omin/omax) of -1. The tests were undertaken using highly polished specimens to determine the fatigue strength of the three precipitation\r\nhardened conditions. The test conditions employed were air and a corrosive 3.5% sodium chloride environment, at pH2 and ambient temperature. The role of the microstructure and the effectiveness of the tensile strengthening mechanisms on the fatigue and corrosion fatigue strength have been discussed. Using SEM, the fatigue crack nucleation mechanisms prevalent within the three microstructures in air and the chloride environment have also been identified. For the peak hardened material, nonmetallic inclusions dominated the fatigue crack nucleation process in air and chloride environments. For the softened overaged condition, multiple site nucleation due to slip band cracking was the prevalent mechanism especially at higher nominal stress\r\namplitudes. The tolerance of this high strength material to small defects at higher stress levels and the actual size of the critical microstructural defects initiating failure\r\nhave also been highlighted.\r\nThe microstructure has been shown to strongly influence the processes of fatigue crack nucleation, Stages I and II crack propagation and the concept of the microstructure acting as barriers and providing resistance to crack growth have been discussed. The effectiveness and the size of these microstructural barriers to crack growth have been considered. This discussion has led to the proposal of a model that facilitates flow stress and fatigue lifetime predictions as a function of the quantity of a key microstructural phase. The key microstructural phase, namely reverted austenite affected both the tensile and fatigue properties of FV520B as a function of the heat treatment.

For the purpose of this research, \u0027adult returner\u0027 has been defined as somebody who left school at the earliest opportunity who, after a period away from formal education, has identified a desire or a need to re-enter the system. Forty-three semi-structured, in-depth interviews and three focus groups have been conducted with a total of 58 adult returners at various stages of the returning process. Some adults had just started to think about returning to education, but had not identified an entry route, whereas others were progressing through their chosen entry route, whether in adult education, further education or higher education.\r\nA process of theoretical sampling and comparative analysis, whereby data are jointly collected, coded and analysed, was adopted for this research. Using this method, themes and categories were inductively generated from the data. Processes, rather than static accounts, were taken into account by conducting a number of repeat interviews. By\r\ndoing this it was possible to consider how learning choices might change as adults progress through their chosen entry route.\r\nThe aim of a grounded theory study is to develop a core-category and a number of related sub-categories. The core category for this research is \u0027parameters of choice\u0027 which describes how adults appear to have their choices framed by a number of parameters which effect the perceived degree of choice available to them. The related sub-categories which have been developed from the data are \u0027re-balancing\u0027, \u0027self-assessment\u0027, \u0027becoming attuned\u0027 and \u0027awareness-raising\u0027.\r\nBy describing these categories and illustrating how they relate to each other, the research goes beyond other studies which consider easily identified and articulated influences on choice, such as those studies which look at barriers to participation.

A so-called Prandtl-Kolmogorov two-equation turbulence model, with turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulent energy dissipation rate E as the two parameters, is incorporated into the time-mean Navier-Stokes equations to form a complete set of partial differential equations which describes the turbulent flow mathematically. The equations are solved numerically via a primitive pressure-velocity finitedifference procedure using a digital computer. The timemean static pressure, velocities, turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate are predicted directly throughout the whole flow field.\r\nTo validate the computer model, predicted time-mean static pressure and velocity as well as turbulent shear stress for flow in a uniform bore mixing tube are compared with the published results. The method is then extended to predict flows in conical diffusers and typical jet pumps. The predictions are also compared with the available experimental data.\r\nA laser Doppler anemometer is used to measure the mean and fluctuating velocities of water jet mixing in a uniform perspex mixing tube with a centrally located nozzle. The measured data which enable turbulent kinetic energy to be evaluated, are compared with the computer predictions to further consolidate the theoretical model.\r\nFinally, the computer model is used to predict the performance of a proposed jet pump and to investigate the\r\ninfluence of various geometrical parameters on jet pump\r\nperformance.

An attempt is made to discover the meaning these caring relationships have for the nurses who provide care and for the patients who participate in this process. The nurses enter into the caring relationship as voluntary and professional participants. The patients come into hospital because\r\nof illness. The relationship entered into is claimed to be a caring relationship yet little is known about the personal experiences of the participants.\r\nIn the first part of the study the repertory grid technique was used to structure interviews with 25 experienced nurses. Personal constructs were elicited and rated during the interviews. Six major themes emerged from a content\r\nanalysis of the constructs. These were: personal qualities, clinical work style, interpersonal approach, level of motivation, concern for others, and use of time. The personal cost of caring for the nurses surfaced as a significant aspect of the caring relationship.\r\nIn the second part of the study 10 nurses and 10 hospitalised patients were interviewed. These were analysed by means of a method grounded in interpretive phenomenology which focuses on the informants\u0027 lived experiences. Nine general themes emerged which captured the nurses\u0027 experiences of caring relationships. The themes were: patient dependency, patient circumstances, effectiveness,\r\nemotional involvement, stress, preparedness, ward constraints, role uncertainty, and personal benefits. The patients\u0027 experiences of being cared for were embodied in four general themes quite different from the nurses. The themes were: vulnerability, self-presentation, service evaluation, and other concerns.\r\nThe thesis provides many details about the perceptions of caring relationships through the exploration of the lived experiences of nurses and patients in hospital. An extended picture of caring relationships in nursing has emerged. The need to take account of both the professional and consumer\r\nperspective is emphasised as it highlights important discrepancies between the views of carers and those they care for. Professional carers must be able to understand the patient in order to care in a personalised way and the approach used here demonstrates how this understanding can be achieved. Such an approach could also be used in nursing practice. The findings and methods used here should also be of interest to other helping professions and consumers of\r\nhealth care.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morrison, Paul Anthony"],"dc:date":"1991-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382087,"sim:weight":0.526488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.416466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17940,"sim:weight":0.384084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382009,"sim:weight":0.376079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.357338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382760,"sim:weight":0.349135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.332238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270258,"sim:weight":0.328422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28035,"sim:weight":0.306141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.305028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46504,"sim:weight":0.304419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.30272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271231,"sim:weight":0.28202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.276398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48298,"sim:weight":0.27599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.265089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.254308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3662,"sim:weight":0.251123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99946,"sim:weight":0.247047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83222,"sim:weight":0.238697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Meanwhile it was confirmed that this 2CrMoNiWV steel can be transformed to a\r\nfully bainitic microstructure over a wide range of cooling rates and this feature proved this steel suitable for large diameter steam turbine rotor application.\r\nAn innovative carbide extraction technique for the XRD identification of carbide phase has been developed. The detailed description of this new technique and its advantages are discussed in this thesis. The extensive work\r\nusing TEM/EDX has set up essential \"finger prints\" for the quick examination of large amounts of individual carbide existing at various heat treated conditions. Simultaneous measurements and determinations were made on particle\r\ncomposition, morphological change, the type, amount and distribution of these carbide phases. Thus the sequence of carbide transformation for this 2CrMoNiWV steel during tempering has been established.\r\nThe characteristic microstructures of various heat treated specimens were carefully examined and discussed. Theoretical thermodynamic equilibria predictions were calculated using MTDATA. A very good agreement was found\r\nbetween experimental results and theoretical predictions on those critical transformation temperatures and a good correlation of carbide evolution sequences was obtained. Based on experimental results and theoretical predictions, the role of tungsten in promoting creep resistance to the material is elucidated.\r\nThe usefulness of equilibrium thermodynamic calculations using MTDATA in predicting the microstructural changes and carbide evolution has been demonstrated in this work, particularly the separate effect of composition on the stable carbide dispersion where a thermodynamic approach offers great benefits.\r\nA possibly optimised heat treatment route is suggested for the large diameter rotor forgings which involves austenitising at 980°C for 10 hours following by oil quenching and then tempering at 675°C for 20 hours following\r\nby air cooling.\r\nSome general conclusions are drawn from this study, especially with regard to the effect of heat treatment on the microstructure of this 2CrMoNiWV steel and suggestions for further work are made.","bibo:AuthorList":["Li, Cheng"],"dc:date":"1996-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":968413,"sim:weight":0.314296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1028990,"sim:weight":0.285125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":917056,"sim:weight":0.282865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":967424,"sim:weight":0.272408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98911,"sim:weight":0.269867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98490,"sim:weight":0.260027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44848,"sim:weight":0.255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18118,"sim:weight":0.230857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":772148,"sim:weight":0.227626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46837,"sim:weight":0.194768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385947,"sim:weight":0.186074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44753,"sim:weight":0.183168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99317,"sim:weight":0.181081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933270,"sim:weight":0.177582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381934,"sim:weight":0.177522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4286,"sim:weight":0.167293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930637,"sim:weight":0.161978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387377,"sim:weight":0.160806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26445,"sim:weight":0.159478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381908,"sim:weight":0.159015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Most of the adducts studied display highly negative solvatochromism as the solvent polarity increases, in which their absorption maxima are linearly related with the normalised ENT values for the Reichardt dye.

One accepted method for improving impact sound insulation is to use floating floors in which the walking surfaces are isolated from the\r\nsupporting structure by a resilient layer. Traditionally the resilient layers comprise mineral or glass fibre quilts but other materials such as flooring grade polystyrene are\r\nincreasingly used. Recently, shallow profile floating floors comprising flexible open cell polyurethane foam resilient layers have been developed. These systems are\r\nattractive for refurbishment projects since they can simply be placed on existing floors in order to improve their impact sound insulation whilst raising the existing floor level less than systems comprising fibre quilts. Shallow profile floating floors with thin layers of flexible open cell polyurethane foam are the subject of investigation as part of this research work.\r\nThis thesis reviews the previous research on polyurethane foams and evaluates the usefulness of the Standard Tests on these materials for assisting in the selection of foam\r\nfor use as resilient layers under lightweight floors. Both the static and dynamic behaviour of flexible open cell polyurethane foam are investigated and recycled polyurethane foam is shown to be particularly useful for use under floating floors Its characteristic behaviour under compressive strain is described for the first time.\r\nThis thesis shows that by modifying the Standard Method for the determinaf on of the dynamic stiffness of resilient layers under floating floors (BS EN 29052-1), the effect of\r\nthe air contained in the open cell foam specimens can be included in the Standard laboratory test. The modification makes it possible to evaluate the dynamic stiffness of\r\nlow airflow resistivity resilient polyurethane resilient layers using the apparatus described in BS EN 29052-1 for the first time.\r\nField measurements of impact sound pressure level conducted using sections of lightweight shallow profile floating floor on a concrete supporting floor are described. The measured improvements in impact sound insulation achieved by using the sections of floating floor are compared with the improvements predicted using the results from the modified Standard laboratory tests on the foams used as resilient layers. It is shown that by compensating for the mass impedance of the Standard tapping machine hammers\r\ngood correlation between predicted and measured data is achieved. A simple method for predicting the weighted standardised impact sound pressure level (L\u0027nT,w) in the\r\nreceiving room is proposed which shows excellent correlation with L\u0027nT,w obtained from the measured data. The work shows that BS EN 29052-1 is more widely applicable than the Standard itself states and for the first time identifies a method of predicting the performance of lightweight shallow profile floating floors with polyurethane foam resilient layers.\r\nFinally the use of the ISO tapping machine for assessing the impact sound insulation of the very lightweight floating floors of interest to this research is considered. Different methods of correlating perceived and measured the impact sound insulation of floors are reviewed. Experimental results conducted in this research programme, along with searches of the literature confirm that the tapping machine is a suitable source for measuring the impact sound insulation of these floors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hall, Robin"],"dc:date":"1999-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98934,"sim:weight":0.18939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387172,"sim:weight":0.156771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.15346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.147507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17994,"sim:weight":0.14275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.13906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.138424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26749,"sim:weight":0.137119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386814,"sim:weight":0.129351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.126063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98580,"sim:weight":0.122484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98895,"sim:weight":0.122421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99320,"sim:weight":0.120711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3159,"sim:weight":0.116722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44242,"sim:weight":0.112434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99041,"sim:weight":0.110976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27903,"sim:weight":0.110923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99089,"sim:weight":0.109887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387311,"sim:weight":0.108655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98594,"sim:weight":0.10697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The problem is exacerbated since there are not presently available methods of measurement, rating and prediction appropriate for low frequency sound in rooms.\r\nA review of the classical theory of sound insulation and room acoustics has shown that both theories are not applicable. In fact, the sound insulation of party walls at low frequencies is strongly dependent on the modal characteristics of the sound fields of the two separated rooms, and of the party wall. Therefore methods originally developed for measurement conditions where the sound field was considered diffuse, may not be appropriate for room configurations with volumes smaller than 50m3 and for frequencies where sound wavelengths are large.\r\nAn alternative approach is proposed using a Finite Element Method (FEM) to study the sound transmission between rooms. Its reliability depends on the definition of the model, which requires validating measurement. FEM therefore does not replace field or laboratory measurements, but provides complementary parametric surveys not easily obtainable by\r\nmeasurements.\r\nThe method involves modelling the acoustic field of the two rooms as an Acoustic Finite Element model and the displacement field of the party wall as a Structural Finite Element model. The number of elements for each model was selected by comparing the numerical eigenfrequencies with theoretical values within an acceptable processing time and error. The simulation of a single room and of two coupled rooms, defined by linking the acoustic model with the structural model, were validated by comparing the predicted frequency response with measured response of a 1:4 scale model.\r\nThe effect of three types of party wall edge condition on sound insulation was investigated: simply supported, clamped, and a combination of clamped and simply supported. It is shown that the frequency trends still can be explained in terms of the classical mechanisms. A thin\r\nmasonry wall is likely to be mass controlled above 50Hz. A thick wall is stiffness controlled, below 100Hz. A clamped thin wall provides a lower sound insulation than a simply supported, whereas a clamped masonry wall provides greater sound level difference at low frequencies than a simply supported.\r\nThe sound insulation of masonry walls are shown to be strongly dependent on the acoustical modal characteristics of the connected rooms and of the structural modal characteristics of the party wall. The sound pressure level difference displays a sequence of alternating maxima and\r\nminima about a trend, dictated by the properties of the party wall. The sound insulation is lower in equal room than in unequal rooms, whatever the edge conditions and smaller wall areas provide higher sound insulation than large areas.\r\nA correction factor is proposed as a function of room configuration and wall area and edge conditions. Attempts to quantify the factor were made using statistical and deterministic analyse, but further work is required.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maluski, Sophie"],"dc:date":"1999-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1384220,"sim:weight":0.307706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26242,"sim:weight":0.258574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270292,"sim:weight":0.253271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1925702,"sim:weight":0.226742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27377,"sim:weight":0.210158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27367,"sim:weight":0.201206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.193702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268060,"sim:weight":0.186682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.186662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269917,"sim:weight":0.185958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26788,"sim:weight":0.184581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.178767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99168,"sim:weight":0.17159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99251,"sim:weight":0.170243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24484,"sim:weight":0.170155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3159,"sim:weight":0.167284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.152267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.14928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931240,"sim:weight":0.130385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98580,"sim:weight":0.129279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Design of the current generation of superalloys has attained these properties at the expense of environmental resistance. This design philosophy has lead to the widespread use of surface coatings technology to protect hot-section componentry from the harsh operating environment. The ongoing drive towards higher operating temperatures has lead to an interest, over the last few years, in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). TBCs are duplex coating systems consisting of a thin, insulating, ceramic layer over a metallic bondcoat. The bondcoat provides both environmental protection and the necessary adhesive interface to maintain the adherence of the ceramic during the rigours of operation. Central to the performance of a TBC system is the integrity and adherence of the alumina scale promoted by the bondcoat.\r\nThis study aimed to design and optimise a novel bondcoat system that was capable of out-performing the current generation of bondcoats and progress the resultant coating\r\ninto a production ready status.\r\nThis was achieved by comparing the performance of a range of bondcoats of both novel and standard compositions, using the modified scratch test in conjunction with hot isothermal and cyclic furnace tests. The down selected system was then analysed using a range of techniques including optical and electron microscopy, XRD, WDS and SIMS\r\nin order to understand the failure mechanisms. The results of the testing programme lead to bondcoat chemistry changes and processing improvements that enabled better performance to be achieved. The bondcoat was optimised and taken to a production standard by using the Taguchi Method of fractional factorial experimental design.\r\nThe resultant coating system offered a higher TBC/bondcoat interface temperature\r\ncapability and extended the life of the system at more moderate temperatures, beyond that offered by systems currently available. The coating system has subsequently been run as a bondcoat for EB-PVD TBCs and has successfully completed the duty cycles on a number of development and test engines.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Robert Edward"],"dc:date":"1999-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":700774,"sim:weight":0.408848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":685985,"sim:weight":0.379478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":772409,"sim:weight":0.36632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11296,"sim:weight":0.329305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386703,"sim:weight":0.328026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":771878,"sim:weight":0.326275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1080347,"sim:weight":0.320107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":700783,"sim:weight":0.319786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387260,"sim:weight":0.288245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":698361,"sim:weight":0.286736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98911,"sim:weight":0.253007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387377,"sim:weight":0.246568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45779,"sim:weight":0.245833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99344,"sim:weight":0.242411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":771846,"sim:weight":0.23664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573684,"sim:weight":0.224845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999862,"sim:weight":0.223607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385113,"sim:weight":0.200586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28352,"sim:weight":0.200048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930637,"sim:weight":0.198299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Pre-eclampsia is a major subgroup of these hypertensive disorders. It is defined as a rise in blood pressure to 140/90mm Hg or greater accompanied by proteinuria and usually presents after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Much of the early research into this disorder has concentrated on the determination of vasoactive compounds such as the renin-angiotensin system and prostacyclin. \r\n\r\nIn the 1980\u0027s it was discovered that an inorganic free radical molecule, nitric oxide (NO), was released from the endothelium cell lining of the vasculature and was involved in regulating vasodilation of the vasculature walls via smooth muscle.It was also shown to have cytotoxic effects on bacteria, to inhibit platelet aggregation and to act as a neurotransmitter. The aim of this research was to assess the role of nitric oxide in preeclampsia. This was accomplished by the analysis of its oxidation products nitrite and nitrate in plasma from women with pre-eclampsia compared with those from normotensive pregnancies.\r\n\r\nA simple and robust assay for nitrite and nitrate was developed using ion chromatography. Initial experiments using isocratic elution with conductivity detection on a Dionex QIC system with an AS4A-SC column showed promise but were unsatisfactory due to the interference from chloride ions. Successive improvements to the technique involved changing the elution system to a gradient, initially to one with carbonate and subsequently to chloride, changing the detector system to direct UV detection at 214nm and changing the column to a high capacity, strong exchanger type. The resulting method shows good resolution, does not suffer from chloride overload and was simple to use. Control results for 200 serum samples showed that the male mean nitrite and nitrate levels were 3.34 ± 5.17 μmol L\" and 42.1 ± 33.1 μmol L-1 respectively while female levels were 4.74 ± 11.7 μmol L-\u0027 and 37.5 ± 27.9 μmol L\" respectively.\r\n\r\nAddition information on the free-radical status of the pregnant study groups was assessed by determination of lipid peroxides and the peroxynitrite product, 3-nitrotyrosine. An improved GC-MS method was developed to quantify total fatty acids and lipid peroxides. A new reversed phase HPLC technique for the analysis of free 3-nitrotyrosine in human plasma/serum was also developed although sample numbers were not as great as expected.\r\n\r\nStatistical analysis using F-tests, t-tests and the Mann-Whitney analysis did not show any difference in nitric oxide metabolites, lipids, lipid peroxides or peroxynitrite between gestation matched normotensive pregnant women and those with pre-eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension.\r\n\r\nPublished research has shown a vital role for nitric oxide in the maintenance of blood flow in normal pregnancy. This research does not support evidence for diminished or enhanced nitric oxide production in pre-eclampsia compared with normal  pregnancy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Monaghan, John Michael"],"dc:date":"1999-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98536,"sim:weight":0.429272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18039,"sim:weight":0.376549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14842,"sim:weight":0.368951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387156,"sim:weight":0.270047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14854,"sim:weight":0.252548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.213791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.203713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.202741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14984,"sim:weight":0.195453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269999,"sim:weight":0.193185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387134,"sim:weight":0.178669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22742,"sim:weight":0.176458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.173131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.172696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.165858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387126,"sim:weight":0.163488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.163169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.158908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269997,"sim:weight":0.149923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.148423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The theory asserts that corporate and business strategies should be built upon the strengths of the core competencies of a firm. The aim of this research is to construct a structured and practical framework for core competence evaluation. The thesis begins with the introduction of the basic concept of core competencies through presenting three core competence-based approaches. Research methodology is described in detail. Two data collection methods are used for this study: case study and questionnaire survey. By reviewing the literature, six competence identification models are identified and analysed. The strengths and limitations of these models are discussed.\r\n\r\nHaving provided working definitions for firm tangible and intangible assets, a relationship between resource and capability is developed and examined. Using financial and non-financial performance measures, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique is employed to determine the key capabilities of firms. Subsequently using \"C llecti enc s\" and \"uniqueness\" attributes, a comprehensive method for evaluating competencies is provided. The attribute \u0027collectiveness\u0027 is introduced for determining the \u0027universal usefulness\u0027 of these candidates in the scope of a business. The attribute \u0027uniqueness\u0027 is employed for assessing the distinctiveness of the potential competence candidates in competition. Competencies are evaluated by subjectively assigning relevant scores to these characteristics. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through to case studies\r\n\r\nThe author believes that being unique in competition is not sufficient for core competencies to keep their strategic values in dynamic competitive environment. A true core competence should be able to continuously create new business options for the firm Therefore, this thesis emphases that to be core competence, the candidates must be strategically flexible. By employing \"strategic flexibility\" as the main criterion, this study has presented a distinctive mechanism to differentiate core competencies from the competencies. The dynamic nature of the core competencies is evaluated using characteristics such as resource re-deployment and routine re-organisation. The generic nature of this framework is tested through conducting two case studies and a questionnaire survey\r\n\r\nThis thesis makes three main contributions to the existing body of knowledge. Firstly the thesis provides a systematic and practical core competence architecture which can be used for firms to accurately understand the concept of core competence. Secondly the thesis gives a detailed and structured core competence evaluation framework which can be used for firms to identify their business strengths and weaknesses systematically. Thirdly by conducting a questionnaire survey, the thesis presents a snapshot of the UK manufacturing and service industry core competencies, and bridges the gap between theory and practice The framework may be viewed as a practical, robust and generic tool to benchmark a service, manufacturing or public sector organisation. The outcome of this study would help companies in strategic decision-making with regards to diversification, focusing and investment in competence building activities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhang, YanBing"],"dc:date":"1999-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1352225,"sim:weight":0.328653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2837,"sim:weight":0.288801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.286785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48334,"sim:weight":0.244545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46578,"sim:weight":0.235147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47237,"sim:weight":0.223837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.221947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.221264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98729,"sim:weight":0.216187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9636137,"sim:weight":0.214417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383496,"sim:weight":0.214109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.213959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9851,"sim:weight":0.212807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99451,"sim:weight":0.198958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9845,"sim:weight":0.194121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.179858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3206,"sim:weight":0.175424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.174815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99409,"sim:weight":0.173287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98956,"sim:weight":0.173026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This system solved the\r\nproblem of crystal filter tuning in a novel way.\r\n\r\nThe system, called AEK (Applied Expert Knowledge), was developed using crystal filters and is a hybrid system with the following two functions:\r\n(1) Required values of features are extracted from the filter waveform and passed to the expert system which determines the component to adjust and the direction to turn, or the end of the tuning.\r\n(2) Sampled values of the waveform are extracted and passed to a neural network which determines how far to turn the component chosen in (1).\r\n\r\nThe prominent aspects were:\r\n- Work using the protocol analysis elicitation technique indicated the need to separate the process into two sub-tasks (stopband and passband). Each sub-task was divided into three classification parts which determined (i) the continuation of the tuning process, (ii) the component and direction to turn, and (iii) the distance to turn respectively. Unfortunately, it was not possible to extract rules from the operator.\r\n- Three learning techniques (IID3, Adaptive Combiners, Neural Networks) were used and compared as the means of automated knowledge elicitation.

It draws from and informs organisational change processes to help understand the effects of environmental disturbance, that is, the changes in the regulatory framework. The effect of environmental disturbance is assessed in terms of the levels and impacts of the changes on values (culture), organisational structures, management, accounting and control systems. The key objective is to critically evaluate the role of a changing accounting system within the framework of organisational change in a UK Clearing Bank, acknowledging that accounting can play powerful roles in the processes of organisational change. This research locates the development and introduction of the new accounting system (ABC) in the context of organisational change and the changes that have taken place in both this single case study and in the wider organisational context of the financial services industry.\r\n\r\nOrganisational change is considered on two levels: The first level looks at organisational change in relation to the Clearing banks in general. The changing nature of the banking organisation is depicted over three decades using Laughlin\u0027s (1991) model of organisational change. This research shows that the UK Clearing banks were ill-equipped to deal with the changes they faced in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. From the more general perspective, the thesis shows how the different levels of the banking organisation became out of balance and how in the 1980s and 1990s efforts were made to re-gain that balance.\r\n\r\nAt the second level, attention is focused on the introduction of a new accounting system in one of the UK Clearing banks. The development and implementation of the ABC system is traced over a period of two years in relation to the specific organisational context. The research shows that the ABC system was both a response to, and, a facilitator of organisational change, helping ultimately to shift perceptions and understandings of the notion of cost, and create new visibilities in relation to cost in the Clearing department. Laughlin\u0027s (1991) model is used again to show how as a response to the kick, there were changes in the organisation structure and decision processes. The research traces the accounting system change, (as part of the change in the design archetype), detailing the organisational members\u0027 perceptions of the new accounting system, from its development through to its implementation. The research shows how the introduction of this new accounting system created change of a second order nature in the Clearing department.\r\n\r\nA \u0027middle range\u0027 thinking approach, (Laughlin 1995) has been adopted. Skeletal theoretical models were used in order to enhance understanding of the empirical data of the case study. In turn, the theoretical framework is extended and enhanced by the empirical situation in which it is applied.","bibo:AuthorList":["Soin, Kim"],"dc:date":"1996-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46637,"sim:weight":0.497699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.441338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.42842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44408,"sim:weight":0.361403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47201,"sim:weight":0.328478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44207,"sim:weight":0.312816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383451,"sim:weight":0.312234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45163,"sim:weight":0.310823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44928,"sim:weight":0.304619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47237,"sim:weight":0.258967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.247293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.244463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.233558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3206,"sim:weight":0.227087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.218167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271238,"sim:weight":0.216624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387372,"sim:weight":0.203767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48369,"sim:weight":0.198639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48321,"sim:weight":0.198021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.187173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":293483,"ep:Repository":102,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Determination of trace elements in hair for monitoring\r\nenvironmental and occupational exposure","bibo:abstract":"Hair has a number of advantages over more conventional sample types, such as serum, whole blood and urine, as an indicator of the intake and exposure to trace elements. While the analysis of these conventional sample types can only be used as a measure of recent exposure, hair, in contrast, can provide an historical record of exposure episodes. Furthermore the levels of trace elements in hair are higher than in blood and as a result small changes in intake are magnified. In addition, the collection of hair samples is non-invasive and the samples are easy to store. However, the difficulty in differentiating surface bound contamination from trace elements incorporated into the hair matrix complicates the interpretation of the hair analysis results. A review of the literature showed that a variety of washing procedures to remove external contamination have been proposed but as yet no standardised procedures are available. In this study, methods for the pretreatment and determination of antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and selenium in human hair by ICP-MS were developed. Chemical speciation of mercury and methyl mercury in hair was also achieved using LC-ICP-MS.\r\n\r\nFor the digestion of hair samples the optimum method for these elements was found to be a digestion mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Certified reference materials CRM 397 and CRM 07601 were digested using this method and the values obtained were seen to be in good agreement with the certified values. Investigations of various washing procedures to remove external contaminants showed that in unexposed hair samples cadmium, lead and mercury were significantly removed from hair using a 0.1M HCl wash, with 87%, 73% and 5% respectively being washed off. Whilst the removal of antimony, arsenic and chromium from unexposed hair was more efficient with 1% v/v sodium lauryl sulphate, with 43%, 40% and 13% of each element respectively being washed off. Selenium could not be removed from the hair by any of the washing methods studied. Experiments with simulated sweat spiked with each of the elements showed that exogenously bound chromium, cadmium and lead could be removed after washing with 0.1M HC1. In contrast, antimony, arsenic, selenium and mercury were irreversibly bound and could not be removed with any of the washing solutions investigated.\r\n\r\nUsing a LC-ICP-MS system it was possible to separate inorganic mercury and methyl mercury in hair, without any modifications to the existing instrumentation. The results showed that in order to determine methyl mercury the sample had to be cold digested in 2: 1 HNO3: H202 and that a minimum of 0.1g of hair is required. Using this method of analysis it was seen that with spiked simulated sweat solutions exogenously bound methyl mercury could be removed from hair after washing with 0.1M HCI, whereas the inorganic mercury was irreversibly bound to the hair. It was also found that inorganic mercury was the major mercury species in hair from dental subjects.\r\n\r\nThe results of a six week selenium supplementation study of 29 subjects showed an increase in hair selenium levels of 19%, confirming that hair concentrations of selenium can give a good reflection of selenium status in the body.\r\n\r\nA control group of 40 unexposed samples were analysed to determine normal levels of antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and selenium in human hair. Occupational studies were then carried out and the data obtained from these studies showed a significant increase in the elements of exposure. Hair samples from dental workers (n \u003d 43) showed a mean mercury level of 813 ng g-1 compared to a control value of 287 ng g-1; hair samples from semiconductor workers (n \u003d 24) showed a mean arsenic level of 208 ng g\u00271 compared to a control value of 34 ng g\u00271; hair samples from chromium platers (n \u003d 7? showed a mean chromium level of 2201 ng g-1 compared to a control value of 985 ng g-1 ; and hair samples from lead foundry workers (n \u003d 13) showed a mean lead level of 124337 ng g-1 compared to a control value of 1030 ng g-1. The lead levels in the foundry workers\u0027 hair samples were reduced by 94% after washing with 0. IM HCl from 124 000 to 7440 ng g-1, which was still above the normal group mean hair lead level of 1030 ng g-1.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mawhinney, Jacqueline"],"dc:date":"2000-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25848,"sim:weight":0.272304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60819,"sim:weight":0.224788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826655,"sim:weight":0.21453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59322,"sim:weight":0.207687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.167924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52649,"sim:weight":0.155092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269979,"sim:weight":0.145501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29432,"sim:weight":0.124844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269965,"sim:weight":0.118908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57895,"sim:weight":0.117078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.116847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494389,"sim:weight":0.114878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9837,"sim:weight":0.114855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62931,"sim:weight":0.114832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99284,"sim:weight":0.112965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71259,"sim:weight":0.110187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933791,"sim:weight":0.110175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25778,"sim:weight":0.110105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17937,"sim:weight":0.108635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":267469,"sim:weight":0.106416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The thesis forms a contribution to the interdisciplinary work of the Human-Centred Office Systems Project, at Sheffield Polytechnic.\r\n\r\nInterdisciplinary research into information systems development is expanding, partly in response to evidence that many systems fail to meet their stated objectives. There is increasing emphasis on issues of \"user relations\u0027, including user-involvement. In offices, as in other contexts, women tend to be defined as users or operators of technology; however, there has been little research into the constraints and opportunities women office workers face specifically in connection with information systems development. Previous projects within Human-Centred Systems research have been located in areas in which men predominate, such as printing and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe thesis makes a contribution to new interdisciplinary research on information systems in two main respects. Firstly, the scope for clerical involvement is examined. It is argued that clerical skills and experience can form a strong basis for involvement in office systems design; in addition, managerial reliance on clerical skill and cooperation appear to increase, with the advent of on-line, integrated office systems. However, the case study research also illustrates the ways in which gendered associations can play a part in the definition of \u0027social\u0027 and \u0027technical\u0027 aspects of systems development, tending to marginalise clerical contributions.\r\n\r\nSecondly, therefore, the thesis examines the potential of Human-Centred systems development approaches to address gender inequalities in opportunities for user-involvement. Methods for establishing a Human-Centred approach in a local authority  department are proposed; an assessment of their use, in a case-study context, exposes a weakness in the Human-Centred tradition in relation to management practices. In conclusion, specific proposals are formulated to support the creation of new links between organisational strategies on information technology and those on gender inequality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Owen, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"1992-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44671,"sim:weight":0.335195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44408,"sim:weight":0.311677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383342,"sim:weight":0.307302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.283857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.265846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.261865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.259761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.258837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.252595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44207,"sim:weight":0.250966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.248652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.244819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48424,"sim:weight":0.244674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.235053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387243,"sim:weight":0.23456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351922,"sim:weight":0.230216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2884,"sim:weight":0.224595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337550,"sim:weight":0.223221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381947,"sim:weight":0.220372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46640,"sim:weight":0.216196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This sensor is used to detect the inherent charge on dry, moving solids. Models are developed to predict the sensitivity of circular and rectangular electrodes. The spatial filtering effect of these sensors is investigated. Cross correlation is briefly reviewed and a software program is presented and tested. For tomographic imaging the forward problem for the individual sensors is modelled, used to solve the inverse problem and derive the linear back projection and filtered back projection algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe design of the electronic circuitry which forms the transducer is presented. The gravity drop flow rig is described and the relationship between sand flow and plastic bead flow relative to the flow indicator setting determined.

It therefore aims to provide a better understanding of the behaviour that engenders this capability. Its contributory value lies in the development of the new perspectives which emerged from inductive theory development grounded in longitudinal data collected between1996-1999.\r\n\r\nTraditionally explanations for the success of SMEs in export markets, it is suggested, have been sought in the marketing mix paradigm rooted in exchange theory. This thesis draws from a range of literature in seeking an understanding of the behaviours observed. In developing a substantive theory to explain the dynamic nature of firms that sustain their competitive effectiveness on international markets this thesis then seeks explanations from the organisational learning paradigm.\r\n\r\nThis study follows the tradition of the naturalistic paradigm and as such the research was a phenomenological study of an exploratory and qualitative nature. The naturalistic paradigm recognises the importance of the subjective experiences of individuals and groups. In the verstehen tradition this study stresses the importance of the informant as the primary source of information. The aim of the inquiry was to develop an ideographic body of knowledge, the emphasis being on explanation and understanding rather than the identification of general and universal laws.\r\n\r\nThe epistemological stance taken required an inductive approach to theory building. Examining the firms longitudinally was the means by which the author was able to take an holistic view of the international activities of the firms studied and focus on the change processes and challenges faced in the study period.\r\n\r\nThe central proposition of this thesis is that the firms that compete effectively on international markets exhibit a positive marketing orientation, and have a strong core purpose on which is generated a clear internationally based strategic direction. It is further proposed that over a period of time, through an iterative process of strategy development, firms build a sustainable competitive advantage in their international markets and develop the ability to maintain this advantage, even when faced with hostile challenges in their international markets. Firms, it is suggested through their relationships, build a virtual structure to their international markets, which provide the means through which a knowledge of their markets is acquired, and an input is made to the strategy development process by external partners. However, it is through the dynamic processes of organisational learning that SMEs develop these capabilities and so enhance their ability to sustain a competitive advantage over a period of time.","bibo:AuthorList":["Doole, Isobel"],"dc:date":"2000-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9845,"sim:weight":0.402638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99151,"sim:weight":0.366882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9851,"sim:weight":0.365643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.354605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381926,"sim:weight":0.34597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46854,"sim:weight":0.325763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.323761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383342,"sim:weight":0.308006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46820,"sim:weight":0.306711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.30659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99444,"sim:weight":0.303698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.292155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47013,"sim:weight":0.288925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98643,"sim:weight":0.271914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71910,"sim:weight":0.268207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9636137,"sim:weight":0.266372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16273,"sim:weight":0.264055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383613,"sim:weight":0.261334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.25081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.246808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The measurement of the rate and magnitude of change of oxygen uptake to dynamic exercise, oxygen uptake\r\nkinetics (V02 KINETICS provides an alternative approach to exercise testing. A submaximal, intermittent, pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) exercise test to measure V02 KINETICS may provide a useful method of measuring the metabolic responses of children to exercise. Traditional methods used in the analysis of V02 KINETICS require the fitting of explicit models in order to characterise the data. These models have not however been validated for use in children. As the responses to the PRBS protocol are analysed in the frequency domain, explicit models and their physiological correlates are not required to characterise the data. Another potential problem in the measurement of V02 KINETICS in children are the small work rate changes that can be employed to stimulate the exercise response whilst constraining the test to the aerobic range. In respiratory gas measurement, breath-by-breath variability (noise) can be large in comparison to the magnitude of the metabolic response and this signal noise can obscure some characteristics of the response.\r\nThe aim of the study was to develop appropriate measurement techniques to reduce the effects of breath-by-breath variability and to apply the techniques to the measurement of V02 KINETICS in children. The main experimental study compared the V02 KINETICS of children with those of adults.\r\nTen children (3 females) in the age range 8 to 13 and twenty adults (10 females) in the age range 20 to 28 years completed a PRBS test to measure V02 KINETICS and an\r\nincremental ramp protocol on a cycle ergometer (Bosch 550 ERG) to establish V02 MAX, T VENT and delta efficiency. Breath-by-breath respiratory gas analysis was undertaken\r\nusing a respiratory mass spectrometer (MGA1100). Estimates of alveolar gas exchange were made using the algorithm of Beaver et al. (1981) and a post hoc value of an effective lung volume was calculated to minimise the breath-by-breath variability. A cross-correlation technique (CC) was used to filter out the effects of anomalous (nonphysiologic)\r\nV02 responses recorded during the PRBS protocol. Subsequent Fourier analysis of the auto-correlation and CC functions provided a description of V02 KINETICS in the frequency domain in terms of amplitude ratio and phase delay over the frequency range of 2.2-8.9mHz.\r\nAt each of the frequencies assessed amplitude ratio was higher in children (P\u003c0.001) than in either of the adult groups. Phase delay was also significantly shorter in children compared to adults males (P\u003c0.01) and adult females (P\u003c0.001) but this effect was not identifiable at any specific frequency. Maximal oxygen uptake was not significantly different in adult males (42.5 ml\"kg \"min) and children (44.7 ml-kg\u0027-min\u0027) but was lower in adult females (36.9 ml\"kg \"min) than adult males (P\u003c0.01) and children (P\u003c0.001). Ventilatory threshold (% V02 MAX) was not different between groups. Delta efficiency was significantly lower in children than adult males (P\u003c0.05) and adult females (P\u003c0.01).\r\nThese results support the contention that there are maturational differences between adults and children in the metabolic processes involved in the utilisation of oxygen during physical activity. It has been argued, theoretically, that in adults the control of V02 KINETICS is driven by ATP demand in the skeletal muscle. As the mitochondria] capacity and the concentration of oxidative enzymes is higher in children than in adults it\r\nis likely that the controlling factor(s) for V02 KINETICS in children also relates to some aspect of peripheral metabolism. It is suggested that the PRBS protocol, with\r\nappropriate noise reduction techniques, is considered a suitable method for investigating the metabolic responses of children to dynamic exercise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Claxton, David B"],"dc:date":"1999-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":17871,"sim:weight":0.248906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98692,"sim:weight":0.223393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18162,"sim:weight":0.204201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90066,"sim:weight":0.172559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99057,"sim:weight":0.170512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385545,"sim:weight":0.16589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.160614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.158379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.152848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.152681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.152113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.150151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383924,"sim:weight":0.148223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18176,"sim:weight":0.147452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573372,"sim:weight":0.141734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.139773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.13808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3143,"sim:weight":0.13198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.128319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23873,"sim:weight":0.128319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its contributory value lies in the inductive development of a \u0027tropological approach\u0027 to the investigation of sensemaking processes in organisations.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003ePositioned in an interpretive-hermeneutic tradition, the major research strategy of participant observation and its supplementary techniques (e. g. qualitative interviewing) were activated to explore sense-making processes. This engagement in the field was complemented by the application of three frameworks derived from the discipline of linguistics. These were: a  structuralist approach (as based on Saussure, Jakobson, Lodge), speech act theory (Austin, Searle) and discourse analysis (Fairclough).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe application of the first framework to data explored the character of signs as well as the relationship between signs. The latter were defined as either metaphorical or metonymical in character. The tropes derived from these relationships, i. e. metaphor and metonymy, provided an early trajectory for further data interpretation. Naturally occurring talk, including organisational stories, talk as recorded in meetings, artifacts including written texts,\r\nbuildings, equipment and geographical arrangements were analysed in terms of their metaphorical and/or metonymical significance in processes of meaning creation. The\r\ninterplay of metonymies, i. e. processes on the basis of physical or causal contiguity, and metaphors, translation and interpretation processes were shown to render the experience of the organisation essentially symbolic. A third trope, irony, emerged as an important figure\r\nduring the research process and was integrated into the tropological approach. Metonymy and irony are undertheorised in organisation studies.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the second organising framework the performative value of tropes was investigated, i.e. in how far \u0027talk and action\u0027 form a dialectic whole. In particular, the question how organisations become active agents, who \"think\" and \"speak\" and \"act\" was investigated with the help of the voice metaphor, exploring the relationship between individuals, agents and principals. Different voices (new voices, fading and fluctuating voices, dissenting voices, having no voice) were investigated. Meaning, although inchoate and in perpetual flux was shown to be linked to the ability to transcend individual status and claim agency on behalf on a higher principal. Deviant meaning and interpretation were investigated as occurring in the trope irony, but also in the denial of metonymical causal linkages between signs and divergent particularisation processes within metaphorical interpretation.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, meaning as derived from a wider discursive environment (Higher Education environment) was investigated from a critical point of view, focusing on hegemonial\r\nprocesses and the manufacture of consent, which \"normalised\" the hidden assumptions of certain discourses by drawing on metaphorical and metonymical devices inherent in language. Irony, again, was shown to be an expression of divergent meaning interpretation.\r\nThe exercise of power as well as resistance were shown to be dialectically enacted at the interstices of everyday practice. These transient, elusive processes are expressed in language, in particular the figures of speech.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn sum, the suggested tropological approach shows metapho as being both constraining and emancipatory in its performative value, metonymy as being the first and foremost habitus of cultural knowledge and iron as being precariously suspended between conservatism and change. The contributory value of this approach lies in the inclusion of two tropes, metonymy and irony, which have not been sufficiently understood or theorised in organisation studies.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Tietze, Susanne"],"dc:date":"1998-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99383,"sim:weight":0.265548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46625,"sim:weight":0.252682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48240,"sim:weight":0.243463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45258,"sim:weight":0.241967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383644,"sim:weight":0.239003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.238583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.235368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.234938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45163,"sim:weight":0.224892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352240,"sim:weight":0.224752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98658,"sim:weight":0.223492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.220982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269897,"sim:weight":0.219773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.21596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18068,"sim:weight":0.214156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584852,"sim:weight":0.207624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88939,"sim:weight":0.204083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106473,"sim:weight":0.203253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.202666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.199729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Women\u0027s initiatives were set up by a small number of Labour controlled councils. At the height of their activities in 1987 there were 45 Women\u0027s Committees, by 1995 only 9 remained (Halford 1988). A central question of this thesis was to examine why the delivery of equal opportunities for women was changing and\r\nwhat form the new initiatives were taking.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe wider significance of studying the political activity of women\u0027s initiatives relates to the development of a new approach to women\u0027s equality delivery. Previous approaches can be classified as a legislative approach, based on the principle of equal treatment, and a positive action approach, which foregrounds women\u0027s material and social oppression. The new approach promoted, most notably, by the European Union argues for the need to \u0027mainstream\u0027 the work of equality practitioners so that every member of an organisation routinely and systematically adopts a \u0027gender perspective\u0027 in their work. A focus on gendered differences, rather than on women, aims to provide a more\r\ninclusive agenda which will appeal to a wider number of policy-makers, businesses and citizens. The second main thrust of this thesis was to explore the development of a\r\nmainstreaming approach to equality delivery in the UK. It contrasts UK practice to that advocated by the European initiative, and also begins to theorise the concept of\r\nmainstreaming in terms of feminist, organisational and sociological theory. Using a new concept of the\u0027equality stool\u0027 to describe the historical development of equality\r\npractice, the thesis attempts to explain why practitioners in the UK local government have been averse to a mainstreaming approach.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe thesis used qualitative methodology and a case study design to examine, in depth, the experience of women practitioners in three local authorities, over the last 20 years. It reports on practitioners\u0027 attitudes and opinions and makes the links between their views of the world, and the actions and events which they have described.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe thesis has three main findings. First, that past practice holds important insights for the development of a mainstreaming approach in the UK and European member states.\r\nSecond, that mainstreaming in the UK has been developed for different reasons and from different perspectives than those of the European initiative. Third, that women\u0027s\r\nequality practice can be seen as a strategy of embodiment, which demands that individuals transform themselves into gender aware actors. Women practitioners\u0027 underlying purpose has been to challenge the gendered conception of women\u0027s roles at work and in society.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe findings are used to construct a table of prerequisites (organised according to Connell\u0027s 1987 gender order) which UK practitioners have identified as important for a mainstreaming approach to be successful. These prerequisites suggest that the development of a structured women\u0027s equality initiative may be a crucial first step\r\nbefore a mainstreaming strategy can be pursued.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Bennett, Cinnamon"],"dc:date":"2000-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45815,"sim:weight":0.460662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.438815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45818,"sim:weight":0.43446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381933,"sim:weight":0.384178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3207,"sim:weight":0.370496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351922,"sim:weight":0.36145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387243,"sim:weight":0.341579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.314761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.297949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2884,"sim:weight":0.291405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.290461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.235561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3533,"sim:weight":0.228615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.228321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.224442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2854,"sim:weight":0.210841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.2052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98731,"sim:weight":0.204415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352126,"sim:weight":0.203483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5149,"sim:weight":0.202883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This framework is then employed in an investigation of women\u0027s participation in a number of\r\n\u0027communities of practice(\u0027Eckert and McConnell-Ginet 1992) previously monopolised by men. Comparisons are also made with women\u0027s involvement in organisations where they are\r\nin a majority and where a feminist ethos prevails. I argue that women often find themselves at odds with the masculinist discursive norms that masquerade as gender-neutral professional norms. This, in turn, has implications for the way in which women are perceived and judged\r\nby others, as well as for the roles they are assigned within the public sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWith reference to selective transcripts of in-depth structured interviews with women in each of the domains under investigation, I suggest that the complex negotiations in which they engage in order to manage contradictory expectations about how they should speak and\r\nbehave cannot easily be accommodated within a dichotomous model of gendered linguistic styles. Nonetheless, this is precisely how their linguistic behaviour is often \u0027fixed\u0027 and evaluated by others, especially by the mass media. I make reference to a wide range of texts from a variety of media in order to illustrate the role the media, in particular, play in mediating the perception of women\u0027s involvement in the public sphere and in (re)producing\r\nnormative gender ideologies.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe first case study focuses on women Labour MPs in the House of Commons. It includes a detailed analysis of the media coverage of Margaret Beckett\u0027s bid for the Labour leadership in 1994. It also considers whether the record increase in the number of women MPs in the wake of the 1997 general  election has helped to make the Government\u0027s policy priorities more woman-friendly and/or has changed the culture of the House. The second case study on women\u0027s involvement in devolved politics briefly considers their contribution to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, before focusing in detail on the contribution made by the\r\nNorthern Irish Women\u0027s Coalition to framing the Good Friday Agreement and to the structures of the new Northern Irish Assembly. The third case study compares the structure\r\nand rhetoric of the London-based Women\u0027s Environmental Network and those of male dominated environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace and the\r\nrelative media coverage these groups receive. The final case study compares women\u0027s involvement in the Church of England as outsiders, campaigning for women to be admitted to priesthood, and as recently ordained insiders, whose subordination within Church structures is sanctioned by canon law.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA central thesis of this study is that both the institutional constraints with which women have to negotiate and the stereotypical evaluations of their performance of public sphere roles have contributed to a process of discursive restructuring, whereby the gendered nature of the public/private dichotomy has been reproduced within the public sphere. However, women are not passively positioned in relation to the institutional and other discursive constraints that operate on them. I suggest that, they, in their turn, have helped to promote a counter tendency whereby the discursive boundaries between the traditional public and private spheres are becoming increasingly weakened and permeable. The study concludes by arguing for a more socially situated theory of language and gender to account for the constant tension that exists\r\nbetween the freedom of individuals to make choices within discourse and the normative practices that function to limit these choices.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Walsh, Clare"],"dc:date":"2000-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45818,"sim:weight":0.485714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383660,"sim:weight":0.485675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381919,"sim:weight":0.477998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381933,"sim:weight":0.427748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.427632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3207,"sim:weight":0.427394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47213,"sim:weight":0.419032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45520,"sim:weight":0.418199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45356,"sim:weight":0.417308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.390361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46560,"sim:weight":0.377143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351922,"sim:weight":0.366908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383641,"sim:weight":0.358231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.355127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18003,"sim:weight":0.349003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48328,"sim:weight":0.331117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.328636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2884,"sim:weight":0.320484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45126,"sim:weight":0.320359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383560,"sim:weight":0.283825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this research is to further\r\ndevelop the concept of benchmarking for application within tourist destinations and to evaluate its potential impact on destination performance.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA holistic model for destination benchmarking was developed using the three main types of benchmark: internal, external and generic. Internal benchmarking aimed at improving a destination\u0027s internal performance by evaluating quantitative and qualitative measures. External benchmarking used tourist motivation, satisfaction and expenditure scores to investigate how one destination may\r\nperform better than another.

However, in the case of external benchmarking, this research indicated that each destination might have its own regional differentiation and unique characteristics in some respects.

Lecturers and students associate the SEQ with the \u0027quality\u0027 agenda; narratives in which the SEQ is perceived as a bureaucratic, management-enforced burden on time and administrative resources relate to the controversial nature of this agenda, and yet also conflate with the negative experience of the SEQ.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAnalysis and discussion expose the letter of policy and statutory texts as legitimating rhetoric, and reveal both the contradictions in, and the inadequate conceptual basis of, the \u0027quality\u0027 agenda.

A combination of different qualitative techniques was utilised in order to shortlist the relevant attributes to be included in each research instrument. These instruments were then subjected to further tests in order to ensure their adequacy and appropriateness. The first research phase ascertained the relative validity and reliability of the existing satisfaction measurement frameworks and was implemented in a chain restaurant in Sheffield. This phase aimed to identify the most reliable and valid operational framework to be utilised in the subsequent phases of the research. The second phase explored tourist satisfaction dimensions and ascertained the relative contribution of each dimension, particularly that of the foodservice experience, to holiday satisfaction and future behavioural intentions among visitors to South West Turkey. The final phase specifically examined what matters most in tourists\u0027 foodservice evaluations, and explored whether different dining segments developed their satisfaction and behavioural intention judgements based on different service attributes in non-fast-food restaurants situated in South West Turkey.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe results of the first phase indicated that a more direct measure of perceived performance might be a better predictor of customer satisfaction than more complex composite measures of disconfirmation of expectations.

While it is expected that tourism can bring substantial benefits, there is also evidence that it can entail negative social, cultural and environmental impacts, and clearly tourism at the regional scale requires careful planning in order to promote sustainable development. While tourism has been planned for decades, there has been relatively little research on how to plan for tourism development at the regional scale in either developing or developed countries. There is growing acceptance that tourism planning at all geographical scales ought to involve broad participation so that the affected stakeholders are engaged in the decision-making. However, research on stakeholder participation in tourism planning has only very recently begun to draw on the valuable insights offered by collaboration theory.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis research examines stakeholder participation in tourism planning based on a case study of the Costa Dourada project, a regional tourism initiative involving ten very poor municipalities in Alagoas State in north-east Brazil. The project sought to combine regular collaborative planning meetings involving a range of key stakeholders with consultation with a much larger number of parties affected by the project. The study examines the participation processes involved in the collaborative planning process, the extent to which collaboration fully emerges in the planning process, and the views of stakeholders not involved in the collaborative planning about the project and the planning process. Additionally, consideration is given to the extent to which the planning process was likely to promote co-ordinated planning and concern for the varied issues affecting the sustainable development of the region.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe approach to the study was based on a conceptual framework that will be of use to other researchers, this being developed from literature on collaboration theory, stakeholder participation in tourism planning, regional tourism planning and sustainable tourism planning. Importantly this framework can be applied to other regional tourism planning contexts. Data for the study was collected from primary documents related to the project, two semi-structured interviews and two structured questionnaires, and from observation of planning activities. The planning issues and the planning process were evaluated from the perspectives of both participants in the regular collaborative planning meetings and also other stakeholders affected by the project.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe results suggest that the approach to regional tourism planning adopted in the Costa Dourada project encouraged a reasonably co-ordinated response from a \u0027broad range of stakeholders whose interests were largely focused either at local, state and national geographical scales. The regional planning process adopted by the project helped the federal government to share power and decision-making with state and local governments. Participants in the collaborative planning were engaged in negotiation, shared decision-making and consensus building and most were broadly supportive of the project aims, decision-making, and decisions. However, some participants had significant concerns, such as about the extent to which everyone\u0027s views were taken into account. The way in which collaborative and consultative approaches to participation were combined was relatively successful in helping to identify key stakeholders and issues, in raising awareness about the project and building external support for the project. The range of participants in the project planning was also likely to promote consideration of many of the issues of sustainable development, although there was only limited involvement of environmental groups and of private sector interests. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe study develops a new conceptual model of the collaborative process in regional tourism planning which was developed deductively from relevant academic literature and also inductively from the Costa Dourada case study. The model integrates collaborative and consultative approaches to tourism planning and relates these to broader influences. One contribution of the study is that it identifies stages in the collaborative process but stresses that these substantially overlap and there are dynamic and iterative links between them.

Firstly, any change in uncertainty of outcome was examined using the standard deviation of Win/Loss percentage adapted from the approach by Noll (1988) and Scully (1989). Demand for the live matches through attendance figures and broadcasting demand, using audience viewing data were examined.

This subject is important to all nurses who work in close day-to-day contact with people under stress. The study uses the Inferential Model of Communication as its main theoretical foundation, emphasising the value of identifying the intentions of the communicator and the inferences made by the respondent. It establishes a Nursing definition of the verb \"to reassure\" as \"an attempt by nurses to communicate with patients who are anxious, worried or distressed with the intention of inducing them to predict that they are safe or safer than they presently believe or fear\".\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe literature review reveals few research-based studies which explicitly refer to \"reassurance\", but many experimental studies of interventions designed to calm anxious patients.

The present work undertook to investigate the relationship between the rheological characteristics of polyborosiloxane/grit mixtures and the associated machining parameters. A significant increase in the quantitative data available with respect to both the rheological and machining characteristics of these mixtures has been provided as a consequence of the investigations.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eExperiments were conducted using low viscosity, (LV), medium viscosity, (MV), and high viscosity, (HV), polyborosiloxane base media, in conjunction with silicon carbide abrasive grit of 60 and 100 Mesh size; the ratios of grit to base polymer utilised in the experiments were 0,1, and 2.

Its main sources are documents of clubs and leading bodies of the sport and the sporting press of the period.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eStarting from an analysis of the spread of rugby from the public schools to the north of England, it links the rapid growth of the sport in the 1870s and 1880s to the sense of civic pride which prevailed among the industrial towns of the North and Midlands. In particular, it examines the means by which working class men and women became involved in the sport and looks at the nature and activities of rugby players and spectators. Its key focus is on the ways in which working class cultural practices became part of the fabric of the sport and the counter-development of the ideology of amateurism as a method of suppressing this, culminating in the Rugby Football Union\u0027s introduction of its first set of regulations intended to stamp out incipient professionalism, which were supported by both the northern and southern leaderships of the sport. It argues that the demands of working class players for payment and the growing commercialism of the sport in the North undermined amateurism and made its implementation, despite the vigorous efforts of its partisans, impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe breakdown in the consensus among rugby\u0027s leaders about how to deal with mass working class participation led directly to the 1895 split and the formation of the Northern Rugby Football Union, based on the payment of \"broken-time\" allowances to players. However, despite its initial successes, the Northern Union was marginalised by a combination of national and class-based forces, and, by the turn of the century, rendered impotent when face by the overwhelming popularity of soccer in the early 1900s. The necessity of establishing its own identity and holding back the soccer threat saw the Northern Union move away from being merely a professional version of rugby union and initiate the rule changes which created a new sport, expand to other countries and develop a distinct ideology. This allowed the sport to become almost exclusively identified with the working classes and opened the door to the predominance of working class cultural norms, both on the field and in the crowds which watched the game.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough class is viewed as the motor force which ultimately drove rugby to schism, the role of civic pride, of both the working and middle classes, the relationship between rugby and masculinity, links between sport and nationalism, the north-south divide in English society. and the rise of commercialism in the form of the \"entertainment industry\" are also examined in the changing contexts of the period for the impact they had on the sport and for their importance to its eventual schism.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Collins, Tony"],"dc:date":"1996-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1352228,"sim:weight":0.635657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48235,"sim:weight":0.399801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382063,"sim:weight":0.365085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50146,"sim:weight":0.332411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46773,"sim:weight":0.290918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352209,"sim:weight":0.2661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46835,"sim:weight":0.2239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383574,"sim:weight":0.217061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46762,"sim:weight":0.213984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382064,"sim:weight":0.210286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.206137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.20311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.201701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383480,"sim:weight":0.192773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.189298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383607,"sim:weight":0.187442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352112,"sim:weight":0.183456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383500,"sim:weight":0.180186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99117,"sim:weight":0.171671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44771,"sim:weight":0.170751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although research has been carried out on the economic activity generated through sport since the mid 1980s (Henley Centre for Forecasting, 1986), the majority of studies have been undertaken at the national and regional level. This thesis investigates the economic importance of sport at the local level, using Sheffield as a case study.

To satisfy the data requirements of this framework, extensive primary data collection was undertaken in the voluntary, consumer and commercial sport sectors using questionnaires and structured interviews. This was used, together with data collected from secondary sources and previous economic impact studies in the UK, to estimate the value-added and employment created from sport-related economic activity in Sheffield.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe findings of the research revealed that the economic importance of sport in Sheffield in 1996/97 was approximately twice the level predicted from current national estimates.

Whilst a number of explanations for these findings are explored within the thesis, one of the most significant findings of the research is that previous estimates, established in other studies on the economic importance of sport in the UK, have been inaccurate and have essentially underestimated the size of the sport-related economic activity.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe research also evaluated the potential role for sport in economic regeneration and provided evidence to suggest that sport can perform as a basic sector activity, a function widely assumed to be fulfilled only by producer services, manufacturing and agricultural activities (Williams, 1997).

Additionally, it is postulated that there are subtleties to human movement which are not reflected in standard anthropometric measures. Therefore, a two stage evaluation has been undertaken that assesses the quality of the analogy realised in the models. This consists of goniometric measures to quantify basic angular rotations whilst qualitative evaluations by professionals with a good anatomical knowledge have been used to assess the more subtle movements within the joints.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe skeletal mechanical analogy developed through this research has been shown through evaluation to simulate the articulations of the human upper-limb.

It is the product of the author\u0027s research into a programme to facilitate business networking that was in operation at several Business Links - the four research sites being at Bristol, St.Helens, Sunderland and Sheffield - and complementary personal action research on two network broking initiatives.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe thesis begins by suggesting that the brokered network entity represents a form of postmodern organisation ideally suited to the globally competitive business realities of the Postmodern era due to its inherent flexibility of structure and purpose.

A review of the literature on networks highlights the significance of others\u0027 research findings to this study as well as directing attention to the social aspects of relationship and the important issue of \u0027trust\u0027 in the facilitation process - the \u0027glue\u0027 that enables progress in the development of relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eHaving established a context for the research the thesis then proceeds to describe the research approach adopted, the research process, the case studies produced and the initial sensemaking of the research \u0027findings\u0027. A hen-neneutic perspective recognising participants\u0027 sensemaking of activities as \u0027interpreted\u0027 and only \u0027meaningful\u0027 within the context of a system was adopted throughout the research process. Each of the case studies resulting from the research highlights a separate issue of concern to brokers within their broking practice and provides insights into their conceptions of the broking process - an empathetic understanding grounded in experience was gained by the author as a consequence of personal action research in two broking initiatives. Consideration of these issues results in the identification of the four themes of governance, identity, learning and time-dependency that provide `themed lenses\u0027 for a reflective review of the research findings and the development of a conceptual framework that enables a comprehensive understanding of the broking process. Each of the themes is explored in the following chapters.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe effective governance of the broking process is argued to depend upon the broker\u0027s ability in managing the mobilisation of the network\u0027s resources and in \u0027managing the meaning\u0027 attributed to network development by its membership - the former facilitating effective operation, the latter facilitating members\u0027 commitment. Effectiveness in the development of the network\u0027s identity and the memberships\u0027 identification with the network is argued to depend upon the broker\u0027s ability to determine appropriate stakeholder definitions that meet the needs of the network and to provide \u0027a vision\u0027 of network purpose and possible development that\u0027s attractive to its members. The effectiveness of the learning that occurs within the broking process is argued to depend upon the broker\u0027s ability to facilitate members in the development of a collaborative mindset and in accepting the necessity of \u0027learning through doing\u0027 as a practical response to inherent dynamism within the brokered network form as well as that within its markets. Time-dependency dictates the effectiveness of the network\u0027s activities (ie. members\u0027 activities) and is argued to depend upon the broker\u0027s ability to create and sustain momentum as well as their willingness to satisfice.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eEach of these \u0027lenses\u0027 results in new insights into the broking process and working definitions of each theme.

The problem has been defined more precisely as how to implement a strategy of quality, which focuses on customers\u0027 needs, in a service organisation, or alternatively, as how to integrate coherently a strategy of service quality, centred on the customers, with the requirements and idiosyncrasies of operationalization, in order to make it successful. The nature and scope of this research problem is based in the confluence of the areas of service quality, strategy and strategy implementation. Thus, addressing this problem naturally requires a review of the literature on service quality, on strategy and on strategy implementation. The literature review on \u003ci\u003eservice quality\u003ci\u003e revealed, first, that service quality is a function of service quality gaps; second, that there are some models of service quality gaps; and, third, that there are several service quality gaps in the literature which are not integrated into any model; thus revealing a need for an encompassing synthesised model. This dissertation consequently considers the existing service quality gap models and a list of other gaps to propose a comprehensive model.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, the literature review on \u003ci\u003estrategy\u003c/i\u003e and on \u003ci\u003estrategy implementation \u003c/i\u003e revealed, first, that there is a lack of clear, detailed and general strategy implementation models; second, that existing strategy implementation models can be separated into two distinct types, the static and the dynamic models; and, third, that existing static models exhibit many relevant aspects but differ strongly on the number and on the nature of the aspects included; thus revealing insufficiencies and the need for an integrative effort. The same happens with the existing dynamic models. This dissertation consequently considers several existing models to propose a synthesised static model and a synthesised dynamic model.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe synthesised static model is a representation of an organisation, of all aspects relevant for strategy implementation, at a given instant. The synthesised dynamic model is a generic process of strategy formulation and implementation that explicitly addresses the requirements for success. Note that whilst the two kinds of models address the implementation problem from different perspectives they are not in competition. In fact, it is the view of the author that static and dynamic models are complementary and have to be integrated into a \"mixed model\", in order to provide a better understanding of strategy implementation. Thus, besides the already mentioned three comprehensive models, that have been synthesised, this dissertation goes further to suggest a mixed model which, simultaneously and harmoniously, considers all relevant organisational dimensions and all relevant stages of the strategy process. The model shows what dimensions can be changed and at what stages. It can be adapted to the specific circumstances of any organisation. Such model, unique in the literature, as far as the author is aware, is finally combined with the service quality gap model to propose: (1) a map of the pattern of the quality gaps occurring at each implementation stage; (2) the organisational variables that can be manipulated, at each stage, to prevent and eliminate the gaps; and (3) several relevant implications to practising managers.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe gap, static, dynamic and mixed models suggested are confronted with some evaluation criteria and with sample data from the four and five star hotels of the Algarve. The data does not provide evidence against the models thus supporting their validity. This tentative validation of the models thus provides some relevant theoretical contributes to the service quality and strategy implementation literatures. Sample data is also used to describe (1) how these hotels are implementing service quality strategies and (2) how they prevent and eliminate service quality gaps. This description has raised concerns about the absence of a consistent model for the implementation of service quality strategies in many four and five star hotels of the Algarve. It also provides some insights to managers interested in implementing a service quality strategy, especially to those of the Algarve Hotel Industry.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Cândido, Carlos Joaquim Farias"],"dc:date":"2001-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44589,"sim:weight":0.359097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99409,"sim:weight":0.308322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.25726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.250497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98718,"sim:weight":0.243724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.243143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383496,"sim:weight":0.224045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.216172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.208777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44432,"sim:weight":0.207544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3206,"sim:weight":0.18639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47013,"sim:weight":0.18467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48321,"sim:weight":0.183964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.181735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.179865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3004,"sim:weight":0.178958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2837,"sim:weight":0.178338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998017,"sim:weight":0.174062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9851,"sim:weight":0.174053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271238,"sim:weight":0.17349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The strategies involved efforts to diversify traditional manufacturing heartlands into new service sector economies. One feature of the approach was the\r\noften rather implausible looking project of creating, out of unpromising material, a new urban sport and tourism industry (Roche 1992b).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFaced with economic and industrial decline in the 1980\u0027s, Sheffield. traditionally a manufacturing and steel producing city, forged sport and tourism together as an\r\nalternative solution to regenerate its local economy. It was believed that investment in sporting infrastructure, and the staging of the XVI World Student Games would derive\r\nlong-term economic and social benefits to all sections of the community (Price 1991). Criticised as reactive and quasi-strategic at the time, the longer-term assessment of these radical investment decisions has been overlooked. The value, role and function of major events in the local UK economic development process is therefore less than fully\r\nunderstood.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eChallenging the traditional economic base theory relationship between the manufacturing and service sectors of an economy, this thesis investigates whether investment in major events has been a rational approach to assist Sheffield\u0027s process of economic development. Utilising Williams\u0027 (1997) hypothesis that major events act as\r\nbasic economic activities; by attracting and retaining external expenditure from sports tourists, the aim of the thesis is to identify whether events act as \u0027catalysts\u0027 to or \u0027motors\u0027 of local economic growth.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the application of an expenditure based multiplier approach, five major events, staged in Sheffield between 1996 and 1998, are estimated to have had a collective impact of £10.4 million over a period of twenty-one event days (£495,00 per day). The findings of the research reveal that the staging of major sports events has a significant short-term impact on the local economy. The impact is conditional upon the type, status and duration of the event staged and the , nature of the visitor groups attracted. Extrapolating the results to all events staged in Sheffield since 1990, the thesis estimates that nearly E32 million has been injected into the local economy.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOn the basis of the results, the research argues that major events are an important part of the consumer service sector of a local economy. As consumer services they act to\r\nstimulate economic growth by importing consumers. While major events are shown to function as basic sector economic activities and catalysts, they are not in themselves large enough to \u0027motor\u0027 a local economy, but are key instruments in diversifying the local economic base.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, the thesis recognises that the academic assessment of major events in the UK is relatively immature, and it highlights the need for rigorous evaluation of the broader cost-benefit parameters associated with staging major events.

The problems of control and resistance observed during this period are analysed in terms of their importance in the constitution of the symbolic reality, or order, of the organization. This is offered as an alternative but complementary perspective to the traditional focus of labour process or social exchange theorists, and suggests a potentially fruitful new direction for organisational analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe thesis falls into two parts: the first discusses\r\nmethodological problems, \"objectivity\" and positivism in\r\n\"reflexive\" sociology, the nature of truth and the importance of community validation; the condition of \"verstehen\", and the relationships between hermeneutics, ordinary language philosophy, ethnomethodology and structuralism; and the development of poststructuralism,\r\nwith the associated reconceptualisation of subjectobject\r\nrelationships, reading, and deconstruction. The methodological argument is that social life constitutes a form, of text and can be approached as a \"fiction\" - that \"method\" or \"playfulness\" is best applied to developing openness and sensitivity to experience whilst developing a critical armoury - seeking to develop our \"readings\" of social life to their limit of sensitive scrutiny and penetrating enquiry.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe second part discusses the observational data more specifically in relation to the creation of and resistance to an organizational symbolic order. The concentration is on marginal data in areas where the symbolic order is emergent and analyses forms of data hitherto neglected in previous treatments. The concept of culture is explored through a critical examination of the consultancy process on a model of primitive sorcery as cultural adjustment;\r\ncultural ownership of criteria for organizational membership is examined through formal and informal induction processes; the capacity of humour to function as a non-real framework for resistance to organizational control is illustrated; and the problems of defining and interpreting acts of sabotage as material resistances rather than as having symbolic significance are discussed.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe final argument is that the processes of symbolization in organizational sense-making have been neglected in the past in favour of the processes of rationalization.

The process may be used to deburr, radius or polish depending on the specific application. Extrusion honing utilises a polyborosiloxane polymer, which is mixed with fine abrasive particles and forced through or around components using an extrusion honing machine to achieve the machining action. It is evident that the machining process is very dependent upon the physical and mechanical characteristics of the polyborosiloxane. However, the process to date has largely been developed empirically, and further developments will require a greater understanding of the relationship between the characteristics of the polymer and the machining action. The rheology of the C-11 polyborosiloxane has been investigated using a concentric cylinder, a slit-die and a capillary rheometer. The shear history of the polyborosiloxane prior to testing with the capillary rheometer was found to significantly affect the results\r\nproduced. At shear strain rates up to 100 s-1 and a temperature of 30°C the rheology of the polyborosiloxane has been approximated to a power law equation (K.\u003d989KPas; n\u003d0.935).\r\nAt shear strain rates greater than 100 s-1 the  pseudoplasticity of the polyborosiloxane increases significantly. Using this power law equation the velocity, shear strain rate and the shear stress within the polyborosiloxane in an extrusion die has been modelled mathematically. \r\nIn some cases the extrusion barrel pressure and the mass flow rate through the extrusion die have both been shown to vary considerably during the constant ram velocity extrusion of polyborosiloxane in the capillary rheometer. It is tentatively proposed that such variations in the extrusion barrel pressure during capillary flow are a result of periodic slipping and sticking of the  polyborosiloxane to the extrusion die wall. This mechanism is thought to be considerably influenced by the\r\npolyborosiloxane temperature, the extrusion ram velocity and the flow passage geometry. It is proposed that the measured variations in the mass flow rate of the polyborosiloxane through the extrusion dies are a result of pressure induced density variations within the extrusion barrel. This mechanism has been mathematically modelled. Temperature profiles within the C-11 polyborosiloxane have been measured on an extrusion honing machine and the results suggest significant heat generation towards the\r\nperiphery of the restriction. These results have been used to model mathematically the heat generation and transfer within the polyborosiloxane during operation of the extrusion honing machine. It is proposed that heat generation during extrusion honing is by friction at the medium/workpiece interface and internal shear within the medium. Both of these mechanisms would cause the greatest heat generation towards the periphery of an orifice\r\nrestriction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Trengove, Sean Alexander"],"dc:date":"1993-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99452,"sim:weight":0.22023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337402,"sim:weight":0.192383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18038,"sim:weight":0.189282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48331,"sim:weight":0.183848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383227,"sim:weight":0.174963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46609,"sim:weight":0.167669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.161344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383230,"sim:weight":0.158504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385944,"sim:weight":0.156631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98745,"sim:weight":0.156013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382991,"sim:weight":0.153103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.14822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45932,"sim:weight":0.140561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46973,"sim:weight":0.140042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384849,"sim:weight":0.139115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98553,"sim:weight":0.136389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573684,"sim:weight":0.134502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44658,"sim:weight":0.133525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387094,"sim:weight":0.129859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99344,"sim:weight":0.129051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This hitherto backward and undeveloped country embarked on an ambitious development programme\r\nand within a span of twenty five years achieved rapid economic growth and social change. The pace of economic development has been determined by the revenues generated from oil which are the main source of income for the government. In its transformation the country relied on an expatriate labour force to meet the demand for a competent work force needed to carry out and run various plans and projects. Their size increased from few hundreds in 1970 to constitute two thirds of the country\u0027s workforce which was\r\nestimated at around 625,000 in 1995.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eUntil 1970, most young Omanis were seeking employment in the public sector. The fall of oil prices from 1986 onwards and the advent of the Gulf crises in 1990, weakened the\r\neconomy of Oman and the Government\u0027s role as the leading employer of school-leavers was reduced. Accordingly, a growing number of young Omanis began to approach the\r\nprivate sector for employment. The private sector employers were, however, more enthusiastic to recruit expatriate workers than to employ young Omanis. The result was growing unemployment amongst young school-leavers. This situation coincided with the majority of jobs being occupied by non-Omanis. This situation raised question marks about the efficiency of the human resource policies of the country. The changes brought about by this new pattern of employment and the difficulties faced by the young schoolleavers\r\nis the central focus of this study.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTo provide an adequate explanation for the impact of this issue, the study drew on the experiences of several countries and covered different issues under different disciplines, in order to formulate a set of assumptions.

In gathering data and generating knowledge, the study employed a triangulation of methods comprising quantitative and qualitative research methods. The employment of multiple methods was essential, on the grounds that not much research has been carried out in Oman.

The analysis illustrates that the move involves more than a \"simple\" change between career forms; rather, it is a much more complex transition, involving the balancing of often incompatible career discourses. In seeking to\r\nunderstand women\u0027s Career transition and development, the analysis emphasizes the importance of occupational identity, the focus of question 5 above.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs regards the second question, in seeking to understand respondents\u0027 decisions to leave their organisations, it is necessary to examine both personal and organisational factors, not as a dichotomy, but as integrally related. Notably, gender emerges as significantly impacting on these decisions: in particular the implications of the ideology of the family for women\u0027s perceived roles and responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to question 3, while for some the move to self-employment was experienced as a single decision, for others it was seen as two distinct, though related choices. Central to this analysis is the significance of family background, and gender. As regard women\u0027s fears and expectations, the analysis explores the notion of \"risk\", and examines the ways in which women\u0027s understandings of concepts such as \"freedom\" and \"control\" changed through their experience of self-employment.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering question 4, those factors which respondents identified as having a significant impact on their experiences of self-employment, their previous organisational experience was seen as central.

According to Pascale (1990), it has received more publicity than any other management innovation. Its level of\r\npopularity seems only to be rivalled by the variety of ways it manifests itself to managers and academics.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis thesis is an explanatory case study (Hamel 1993; Yin 1994), based on research into one company\u0027s efforts to introduce Total Quality Management to their organisation. The research task was to explain the changes being brought about within the researcher\u0027s employing company, Ilford Limited, a photographic materials manufacturer, during six years of TQM adoption.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe exploration of different perspectives that would explain the organisational changes being studied were primarily driven by a search for \u0027useful knowledge\u0027 (Louis 1983). This work grew from TQM as a quality improvement programme to the use of an ideological perspective and\r\ncritique, (Bendix 1956; Gramsci 1971; Seliger 1976; Giddens 1979; Anthony 1977; Habermas 1984; Mumby 1988), which could be seen as contextually relevant, (Pettigrew 1985).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBendix defined management ideology as \"those ideas which are espoused by or for those who exercise authority in economic enterprises\". It will be argued that TQM renews the\r\nideological appeal which is focused on securing managerial commitment to the aims of the organisation. The need for a renewed appeal in Ilford followed an \u0027array of cost cutting\r\nattacks\u0027 such as redundancy and reorganisation, in which managers have become as much the victims as the shop floor workers in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe effect of this \u0027victimisation\u0027 on the management community in Ilford was significant and led to an increasing alienation of its managers, (Baxter 1982). This alienation was aggravated by a rising cynicism amongst managers and a loss of value previously inherent in\r\ntheir work as a central life interest.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe importance of committed managers to the success of the organisation is highlighted by Anthony, who comments that managers will replace the manual worker as the focus for ideological appeal, because they are now \"the determinant of productivity\". In Crosby\u0027s (1979) view, management commitment is \u0027Step One\u0027 in improving quality management and other writers on quality such as Deming (1986) and Juran (1992), would concur that managers are also  the \u0027determinant of quality\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTQM has therefore, two main roles, an overt role as a rational response to poor competitiveness and a covert role of renewing the legitimacy of a management ideology. Both of these roles are examined in this thesis.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTQM as ideology is also a critique of the rational management perspective, in Thompson\u0027s (1989) words, \"ideology is the thought of the other\". The derogatory use of the term to indicate a \u0027false consciousness\u0027 and as a hegemonic project that has infiltrated companies with \"New Right\" ideas of the \"internalisation of market relations\", has been developed by some Trades Unions and academics, ( Hall, 1988; GMBU Paper 1991; Du Gay and Salaman 1992; Tuckman 1994).

This development has been motivated by National Health Service reforms and a realisation that earlier fragmented systems were not meeting the requirements of clinical and nursing staff in the most effective way. Such systems were often developed by external, centralised agencies using systems analysis techniques appropriate to the development of information systems in product orientated organisations. However, the hospital ward, an environment existing at the \u0027sharp end\u0027 of health care, in which many diverse and non-computer related activities take place, presents the system designer with many of the classic problems with which the discipline of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is concerned. Although a HISS has the potential to improve both the work conditions of clinical staff and the delivery of health care, this may be impeded by many of the common obstacles associated with the introduction of a large and complex computer system into a work environment where tasks are ill defined.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis thesis reports on a project that is based upon the application of HCI methods to the health care environment and their contribution to the solution of the problems that such an environment presents. Requirements for the users\u0027 interface to the potential HISS are derived using a task analytic approach, involving Task Analysis for Knowledge Descriptions (TAKD). A prototype system has been designed and subsequently evaluated in a hospital ward.

The numerical modelling was applied using indirect boundary element method formulation. The commercial software named SYSNOISE was employed for the computations.

The impetus for this project was the growth and government promotion of family mediation in the 1990s as an alternative/adjunct to the services provided by a solicitor.

The nature\r\nof particular ecologies can be described(and researched) using similar dimensions to community of practice theory and this is illustrated by a case study which contrasts\r\nusual school mathematics practices with those that foster greater engagement by participants.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe concept of the lifeworld supports understanding of the different experience of participants in ecologies of practice of mathematics and teacher questioning.

A case study of a mathematical lifeworld shows school mathematics can be deeply existentially alienating and marginalizing for learners.

In particular, this research aims to examine the contemporary ethos of specialism in diagnostic radiography; how the higher status of technology has developed over patient-centredness; the impact of the working relationship between radiology and diagnostic radiography on this development; the relationship between gender and the nature of occupation in the development of diagnostic radiography.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eQualitative data was collected using 31 semi-structured interviews that took the form of oral histories where possible.

Defining specialism and expert practice is difficult, as both are negotiated constructs that tend to have local meaning. Not all specialisms in diagnostic radiography increase professional autonomy and management has a key role to play in the development of radiography as a profession to enable full engagement with consultant status. To a great extent, diagnostic radiography and its associated specialisms is governed by an emphasis on technology rather than the patient. This emphasis has roots in power difference between radiologists and radiographers and within the hierarchy of radiography. Radiologists have controlled radiographers to provide a service to radiology rather than the patients, and, although this is still evident in some hospitals, it is changing. Task offloading from radiologists to radiographers confuses the notions of specialism and radiography is in danger of seeking professional development through emulating radiology rather than using radiographic caring skills and expanding practice with a humanistic and patient focused emphasis. Radiography emerged as a pioneering, elite profession that could originally be regarded as a specialism of nursing. Technology and medicine gradually reduced radiographic practice to have a technological and quantitative focus. There is now a demand to once again broaden radiographic practice to actively contribute to a patient-centred service in an autonomous, more qualitative and self-directed manner. A collection of oral histories has been a direct result of this research. Specialisms are a broad area of diagnostic radiography and rather than focus on technological areas of practice, a more holistic range of specialisms could be embraced to enable the profession to progress.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Ferris, Christine Margaret"],"dc:date":"2005-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103902,"sim:weight":0.225371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48314,"sim:weight":0.209322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3198,"sim:weight":0.202722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.181452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.179759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.175757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99119,"sim:weight":0.173754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98719,"sim:weight":0.170801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383383,"sim:weight":0.170434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44915,"sim:weight":0.162381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382059,"sim:weight":0.159844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.159276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387374,"sim:weight":0.155478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.154709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99123,"sim:weight":0.152945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17940,"sim:weight":0.147906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382009,"sim:weight":0.144713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.144705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99172,"sim:weight":0.143823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387268,"sim:weight":0.143333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This relationship is understood in terms of a politics of space. The New Left is defined broadly for this purpose as a movement emerging from the dislocating experiences of social, cultural and physical mobility in the postwar period. What is termed the \u0027modernisation project\u0027 is more expansive than the technological and scientific modernisation espoused by Harold Wilson in the early 1960s and is understood to address these new, politicized forms of mobility. Whilst one element of this Politics of dislocation and mobility was a concern about affluence and new forms of cultural consumption, another was concerned with the cultural and geographical dislocation of the upwardly-mobile (sometimes thought of in the language of the \u0027scholarship boy, \u0027 but with the growth of the student population also associated with the notion of a counterculture). The significance of an enlarged and dislocated intelligentsia is explored through the example of British Pop theory, the approach of which was to engage positively with popular culture, emphasising the value of mass-produced cultural forms which had the qualities of rawness and vitality on the one hand, and expendability on the other. British Pop theory employed pop to explore an alternative historical approach to working class culture but also suggested a different approach to upward-mobility. Contested geographies are explored through the example of New Left attitudes towards suburbia, megalopolis and the cultural geography of the North-\r\nSouth divide. 1968 is explored as the moment when the New Left engaged in a particular form of spatial politics: certain types of space were valued for their psychological characteristics, their sociological inaccessibility to the manipulative power of capitalism, and their capacity to liberate the subject from new forms of alienation. The spaces of New Left protest in 1968 are then compared to other examples of radical space based on radical architecture theory. The politics of the barricade are compared to the politics of indeterminacy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Goldie, Christopher Thomas"],"dc:date":"2005-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383574,"sim:weight":0.306967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44614,"sim:weight":0.294065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.283041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.27748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.263657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89031,"sim:weight":0.261818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.259572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17989,"sim:weight":0.254508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313581,"sim:weight":0.245063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5149,"sim:weight":0.242739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.23661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2888,"sim:weight":0.233056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.226091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.221427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99117,"sim:weight":0.220803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383497,"sim:weight":0.220245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15001,"sim:weight":0.218052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44140,"sim:weight":0.2144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2880,"sim:weight":0.207399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.201477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Despite the prevalence of Physical Activity Referral Schemes (PARS) in Britain, to date, there has been no attempt to elucidate their public health role. The nature of this role will depend upon who schemes are accessible to, and appropriate for.\r\n\r\nObjective. The aim of the present research was to provide a rigorous account of sociodemographic bias in referral to, and attendance of a county-wide PARS by tracking participant progress, from point of referral to the end of their involvement with the scheme.\r\n\r\nMethods. Epidemiological methods were applied to analyse data from people referred to the Somerset-wide ProActive PARS over a three-year period. For all Somerset residents referred, age, gender, and the deprivation level (measured by the Townsend score) and urban-rural character of their area of residence were used to make socio-demographic comparisons with the county population as a whole. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis difference tests were used to compare socio-economic characteristics. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify sociodemographic characteristics associated with referral uptake (attending ≥1 session) and completion of physical activity programmes (≥80% attendance).\r\n\r\nResults. The proportion of referred participants (n\u003d3569) who were female was above the county average (61.1 vs. 51.4%). Referrals increased markedly with age from 6.6% (≤30 yrs) to 22.7% (50-59 yrs), dropping off sharply thereafter (≥60 yrs). The mean Townsend deprivation score for participant area of residence was greater than the county average (0.33 vs. 0.00, p\u003c0.001). These patterns indicated that, with the exception of older adults, those groups most likely to consult primary care were referred most frequently. Regression analysis (n\u003d2864) revealed that increasing age (Exp(B)\u003d1.014, p\u003c0.001) and urban residency (Exp(B)\u003d1.317, p\u003c0.001) increased the likelihood of referral uptake. Uptake was less likely for those living in more deprived areas (Exp(B)\u003d0.933, p\u003c0.001). In participants who took up referral, the likelihood of completion was lower in women than men (Exp(B)\u003d0.818, p\u003d0.041) but increased with age (Exp(B)\u003d1.018, P\u003c0.001). \r\n\r\nConclusion. Younger people, residents of deprived and rural areas, and women appear less likely to progress through schemes or complete PARS programmes, regardless of relative scheme exposure. PARS appear more appropriate for adults of middle-to-old age who are more likely to require supervision and should be targeted accordingly. To promote physical activity in a preventive capacity and to increase activity across the socio-economic strata is likely to require broader and multi-faceted environmental and policy-led interventions to promote habitual activity, rather than attempting to increase recreational activity through individual-orientated such as PARS.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gidlow, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2006-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66882,"sim:weight":0.211443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95974,"sim:weight":0.209061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99244,"sim:weight":0.190693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23711,"sim:weight":0.189229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.182869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.174617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.172078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.169744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83563,"sim:weight":0.169593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83383,"sim:weight":0.162579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91804,"sim:weight":0.160877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383611,"sim:weight":0.159722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83480,"sim:weight":0.157764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99012,"sim:weight":0.156074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.154557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29886,"sim:weight":0.153916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83632,"sim:weight":0.149933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22996,"sim:weight":0.149178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.142841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.141511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aims of this thesis were to investigate the effects of exercise on desire to smoke, withdrawal symptoms and mood in young people, and to investigate the promotion of physical activity and exercise in young people who smoke, using a variety of methodologies. Five studies were conducted to investigate these aims. There was some evidence to suggest that a short bout of moderate intensity exercise can be beneficial in young adults, but this was not the case in adolescents. Overall, both moderate and vigorous intensity exercise reduced the desire to smoke relative to control, however moderate intensity exercise\r\nprovided the most benefit in terms of withdrawal symptoms and mood in young adults. With regard to physical activity promotion, the theory of planned behaviour appears to be a useful framework for explaining physical activity behaviour among young people who smoke, however an exercise consultation intervention to promote physical activity in this population did not prove feasible regarding participant recruitment. In addition, an evaluation of physical activity prompts designed for young people (including smokers) revealed that such prompts are likely to be most effective if they contain intrinsically motivating messages. With regard to issues surrounding physical activity and exercise behaviour, young smokers appear to constitute a distinct population, and may\r\npresent their own unique challenges for the promotion of physical activity. The findings of this research have important public health implications for physical\r\nactivity promotion with young smokers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Everson, Emma Stefania"],"dc:date":"2007-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83001,"sim:weight":0.350496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.333233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23873,"sim:weight":0.333233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83566,"sim:weight":0.316999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83480,"sim:weight":0.316434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.301747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83563,"sim:weight":0.27348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98978,"sim:weight":0.266022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44708,"sim:weight":0.255595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100433,"sim:weight":0.245538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66882,"sim:weight":0.245433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83632,"sim:weight":0.239712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83254,"sim:weight":0.239146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3349,"sim:weight":0.23182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3348,"sim:weight":0.231517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99919,"sim:weight":0.226826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82100,"sim:weight":0.222167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23711,"sim:weight":0.215105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26676,"sim:weight":0.207655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386904,"sim:weight":0.205832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the past ten years the problem of \u0027low demand\u0027 housing has also been an issue for housing providers in certain areas of the North and Midlands. Attention has been drawn to the asset management strategies of housing associations, however relatively little is known about the process by which stock investment decisions are made. This thesis investigates the decision-making behaviour of three housing associations, with a focus upon power and knowledge in the decision making process. Using the context of asset management and low demand housing it examines how and why decisions are made within the three case studies. Drawing on two decision-making models, the \u003ci\u003epolitical-bureaucratic\u003c/i\u003e (Pettigrew\r\n1973) and \u003ci\u003ebehaviourist\u003c/i\u003e (Cyert and March 1992) models, the study develops an analytical framework derived from Foucault\u0027s relational concept of power and Clegg\u0027s \u0027circuits of power\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBy adopting a qualitative approach the research explores current decision-making practices through the use of semi-structured interviews, focus groups and documentary analysis. The empirical evidence suggests that the concept of power is integral to understanding how decisions are framed and then made. However, power is a complex concept and housing associations are devising their asset management strategies in a shifting external environment. Different agencies are significant, depending on the commercial strength, geographical base, scale and degree of maturity of the association in question. The analytical framework enables power to be traced within each case study\r\nthrough examining the organisational tactics and \u0027game playing\u0027 in place. But it also identifies constraints with the \u0027relational\u0027 concept of power, suggesting that where\r\npower resides is also important.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003ePower is also closely linked to knowledge, and each case study used information selectively as an expression of power relations. In response to the greater commercialisation of the sector housing associations\u0027 approach to asset management is changing. Some are grasping at these opportunities, whereas others are finding such\r\npressures in tension with their original mission. Some larger associations are becoming \u0027learning organisations\u0027 and it is anticipated that the more successful agencies in this group will become increasingly autonomous from the Housing Corporation and other regulatory bodies in their approach to asset management due to these changes.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Albanese, Francesca Claire"],"dc:date":"2007-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.285515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3789,"sim:weight":0.284293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383642,"sim:weight":0.267236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.254093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.239788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.234258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99444,"sim:weight":0.230319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16594,"sim:weight":0.225864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45163,"sim:weight":0.225444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.221059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381947,"sim:weight":0.217343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47013,"sim:weight":0.213659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9851,"sim:weight":0.213196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.201875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.198709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3206,"sim:weight":0.181359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71910,"sim:weight":0.180211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48369,"sim:weight":0.175982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.175924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387372,"sim:weight":0.175232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Hence, significant moves had been made to improve awareness around, and the services involved in, prisoner `resettlement\u0027. This took place amidst reemerging national interest in aspects of such provision and activities, and their effectiveness in reducing `re-offending\u0027 rates. Unlike the Regional Resettlement Strategy, this independent research examines the assumption that `partnerships\u0027 enhance the delivery of `resettlement\u0027 services within prisons. The thesis takes as its focus a period when prisons and their `partners\u0027 were considering, and responding to, emerging central governmental proposals for a National Offender Management Service which resulted from the publication of Patrick Carter\u0027s (2003) `Managing Offenders, Reducing Crime: A New Approach\u0027. It makes problematic, and identifies, key features of `partnerships\u0027 and shows disparate meanings are attached to the terms `resettlement\u0027 and `partnership\u0027. These are influenced by a range of political, organisational, and individual factors.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eRecognising `partnerships\u0027 have created, and continue to create, enhancements in the forms of more `client-centred\u0027, `holistic\u0027 services, exposing prison staff to broader\r\nskills/expertise and organisational values, it is acknowledged that these are often accompanied by increasingly complex relationships. These include those between staff within prisons, organisations, and service users\u0027 experiences of these. As a result, this thesis brings into question the suitability of existing theories in depicting the `state\u0027 and the role(s) of `partnerships\u0027. The Action Research study utilises a basic text response survey, `solicited\u0027 prisoner diaries, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and participant observation to assess the opinions of participants from a range of\r\nbackgrounds, be they staff members or service users from statutory, private, or Voluntary and Community Sector organisations. It juxtaposes action research with the\r\nadoption of a `grounded theory\u0027 approach to data collection and analysis. The influences of self perceptions and personal attitudes are accounted for in both shaping,\r\nand responding to, the interactions and environments researched.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eData revealed five key themes and each of these constitutes a chapter.

However, the analysis reveals that prisons can experience aspects of these paradoxically. Two models of `partnerships\u0027 are proposed by drawing on aspects of these paradoxes. These include a hypothetical `worst case scenario\u0027 and one constructed from `best practice\u0027. Through appraising the disparate meanings given to `resettlement\u0027 and `partnerships\u0027 the thesis examines how various actors can make sense of `partnerships\u0027, enhance practice, and sustain a `holistic\u0027 vision of `resettlement\u0027 provision.

Copper indium diselenide (CuInSe\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e) was deposited from ethylene glycol at 150°C with the aim of improved material properties due to the elevated temperature. The broad nature of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks before and after annealing indicated the layers were comprised of multiple phases identified as CuInSe\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e and Cu-Se binaries. Insufficient indium inclusion for device quality materials was incorporated into the layers over the explored growth range of -0.800 to -1.000 V vs Se reference electrode.

However, currently there are few published studies on the simulation of tennis impacts using finite-element (FE) technique. The purpose of this study was to produce accurate FE models of tennis impacts, which will serve as design tools as well as aid in furthering the understanding of how the ball, string-bed and racket behave during play.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAn FE model of a pressurised tennis ball was produced in Ansys/LS-DYNA 10.0 and validated against experimental data. The ball model was updated to simulate the extreme playing temperatures of 10 and 400C and validated against experimental data, obtained inside a climate chamber. Following validation of the ball model, an FE model of a head-clamped racket was produced and validated against experimental data. The validation included a range of inbound velocities, angles and spin rates, for impacts at a number of nominal locations on the string-bed. Finally, an FE model of a freely suspended racket was constructed and validated against experimental data. Impacts were simulated at a number of nominal impact locations on the string-bed, with a range of ball inbound velocities, angles and spin rates. The impacts were recorded using two Phantom 4.2 high-speed cameras and analysed in 3D. The FE models were all in good agreement with the experimental data, for the individual stages of the validation.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eA parametric modelling program was produced to be used in conjunction with the model. This program enables the user to adjust a variety of parameters, such as the inbound velocity of the ball, impact location and mass of the racket, and run simulations without any specialist knowledge of the FE model. This program was used to analyse the model against ball to racket impact data obtained during player testing. There was relatively good agreement between the model and player testing data.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the model was used to determine the influence of racket structural stiffness, mass and the position of the balance point, when performing a typical topspin forehand.

Literary tourist destinations are places visited because of their associations with books or other literary outputs and with their authors. Such destinations are becoming increasingly popular as visitor attractions. This research examines the visitors to one well-known literary tourist destination. It examines the motivations, experiences and attitudes of the visitors as they relate to the authenticity of the destination.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough literary tourism is a significant part of both the cultural and tourism industries, it is very largely under-researched. Most concentrates on the historical emergence of literary tourist destinations. The present examination uses a case study of tourists visiting the literary tourism area of Haworth, West Yorkshire, England which was home to the literary Bronte family. The nature of the links specifically between literature, authenticity and tourism remain under-researched, with little sustained attention given to questions surrounding the authenticity of literary tourist destinations. Hence, the case study investigates visitor attitudes to the character of authenticity at the destination. Authenticity is evaluated explicitly as a social construct, and the research also questions how tourists respond to the signs or markers of literary connections. In this way, the research adds to the understanding of literary tourist destinations, visitor attitudes to authenticity, and their perceptions of, and responses to, signs as markers of authenticity.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe case study is based on a social survey which comprises three different semi-structured questionnaires.

This research adds to methodological sophistication in tourism research by its innovative use of visual stimuli as a projection technique, with this method rarely being used in tourism studies. Verbal stimuli were less likely to be appropriate to explore the signs that visitors use as markers of authenticity. Consequently, photographs including key potential signs were used as a stimulus to gain insights into visitor responses.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe results indicate that the literary tourist destination of Haworth attracts a broad range of visitor types, and that the different types of visitors differed in their motivations and experiences.

Empirically, our investigation focuses on those management academics, who are non-native speakers of English (MA NNE), yet who have to articulate and publish \u0027what they know\u0027 in English. We argue that this is not only a technical-language based disadvantage to these scholars, but also a continuation of \u0027linguistic imperialism\u0027, a historical-political process by which one language and the knowledge it contains comes to supersede all other ways of  knowledge generation and its articulation. This, as we show, has consequences for the careers and well-being of management academics as well as for the generation and dissemination of knowledge itself. In concluding we propose that in particular power, literary and knowledge brokers in the academy need to stimulate debate and break the silence on which the hegemony of the English language is based.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tietze, Susanne","Dick, Penny"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":741733,"sim:weight":0.483682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":560738,"sim:weight":0.463382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1140671,"sim:weight":0.423661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47037,"sim:weight":0.403632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47225,"sim:weight":0.364505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387333,"sim:weight":0.326054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2840,"sim:weight":0.307424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41392,"sim:weight":0.305775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112429,"sim:weight":0.298369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98578,"sim:weight":0.296311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45027,"sim:weight":0.267977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998629,"sim:weight":0.238944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.229546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.228454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71910,"sim:weight":0.223927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.221504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.220809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48395,"sim:weight":0.220694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.220441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47012,"sim:weight":0.214471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The problem is\r\nexacerbated in this field as the political agenda of inclusion and involvement is driven by those people with\r\nlearning disability who are the higher functioning. To overcome this we should first detach the notion of\r\nconsent from ideas about autonomy and think instead of it as a way to avoid wronging others; this fits\r\nthe original historical use of consent in research. This allows us to think in terms of including\r\nparticipants to the best of their abilities rather than in terms of a threshold of autonomy. Researchers\r\ncould then use imaginative ways to include the least able and to ensure they are not wronged in research\r\nor by exclusion from it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mcclimens, Alex","Allmark, Peter"],"dc:date":"2011-06-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269897,"sim:weight":0.478201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.4254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383650,"sim:weight":0.392872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.384726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.346375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18196,"sim:weight":0.336487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3198,"sim:weight":0.335377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2883,"sim:weight":0.305435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48318,"sim:weight":0.300852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100145,"sim:weight":0.294088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.271082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382009,"sim:weight":0.247961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.21931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100362,"sim:weight":0.199221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83569,"sim:weight":0.195207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2845,"sim:weight":0.194735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18956,"sim:weight":0.188734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100431,"sim:weight":0.188341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.182046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933572,"sim:weight":0.182046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, with the increasing\r\naccessibility to new technologies and intensified competition, managers have been\r\nalerted and become more aware of the fact that achieving excellence is made even more\r\ndifficult - financial institutions must now do much more to excel in the competitive\r\nretail banking environment of the new millennium.

Hence, some financial institutions may cast doubts on their\r\napplicability of TQM because the relationships between TQM principles and the results\r\nof business excellence are not assessed. As such, it should be valuable to develop and\r\nprovide a model, which is capable of covering the TQM essence in a structured way to\r\ndrive total quality improvement efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe present research aims to develop a theory-driven as well as practical model for\r\nretail banks and the retail banking sector to achieve business excellence. In the process,\r\nHong Kong retail banks and the Hong Kong retail banking sector were chosen as the\r\ncontext for the present research to obtain valuable data on how successful\r\nimplementation of TQM essence could contribute to business excellence in a Chinese\r\nsociety. Both employees and customers inputs, being the important sources of\r\nstakeholder information, have been the basis for analysis. Top performing bank\u0027s\r\nexecutives were interviewed to identify the core activities and factors that determine\r\ntheir bank\u0027s success. Further, data were collected from executives of 47 retail banks in\r\nHong Kong. Structural equation modelling was employed to develop the new Business\r\nExcellence Model (BEM). SEM\u0027s software programme was employed to analyse the\r\ngoodness of fit of the new BEM. The forces of excellence indices and business\r\nexcellence indices of the sampled retail banks were computed using the Partial Least\r\nSquares (PLS) technique. The same procedure was also applied to the data collected\r\nll\r\nfrom retail customers in the survey to measure the level of customer satisfaction of the\r\nretail banking sector. The indices of the BEM were then matched to the customer\r\nsatisfaction indices of retail banks and retail banking sector for higher level of analysis.\r\nFindings of the present work indicate that the new BEM fits the data of the 47 retail\r\nbanks very well. The BEM is a valid and reliable model for enabling retail banks to\r\nreview the current level of practice in relation to their critical success factors\r\ncontinuously. With the new BEM, they can now measure and drive improvement in\r\ntheir critical activities and finally achieving business excellence. Similar results obtained\r\nfor customer focus dimension of the BEM and the customer satisfaction measurement\r\nhave further substantiated the robustness and usefulness of the new BEM.

This is followed by a\r\ndiscussion of action research, exploring one case study in some depth, chosen\r\nbecause it helps to illustrate both the strengths and the potential limitations of a\r\ncritical approach to action research.

The article concludes with recommendations for good practice, and future research, highlighting the importance of an equalities and human rights foundation for learning about sex and relationships, for both young and old, and people of all sexual identities/experience.","bibo:AuthorList":["Formby, Eleanor"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99923,"sim:weight":0.642852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11156,"sim:weight":0.522348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99937,"sim:weight":0.49978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25774,"sim:weight":0.484838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26615,"sim:weight":0.470796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90719,"sim:weight":0.443491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":115036,"sim:weight":0.419541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83252,"sim:weight":0.40389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100377,"sim:weight":0.401402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15443,"sim:weight":0.391672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9321447,"sim:weight":0.377861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":324054,"sim:weight":0.352922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9544211,"sim:weight":0.350132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45666,"sim:weight":0.333412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82225,"sim:weight":0.328451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2516,"sim:weight":0.325683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89200,"sim:weight":0.319933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44378,"sim:weight":0.317016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2518,"sim:weight":0.315074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83001,"sim:weight":0.307416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":294062,"ep:Repository":102,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The Sheffield peace movement 1934-1940.","bibo:abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThe object of the thesis was to build a portrait of a local peace movement in order to\r\ncontrast and compare it with existing descriptions of the peace movement written from a\r\nnational perspective. The Sheffield Peace Movement is examined from the commemoration\r\nof the twentieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Great War to the disestablishment and\r\nreformation of the Sheffield Trades and Labour Council in 1940 as a result of its support for\r\nthe anti-war line taken by the Communist Party of Great Britain. The peace movement is\r\ntreated holistically. Political, religious and other organisations associated with it are\r\ndiscussed alongside groups specifically devoted to the issues of peace. These various strands\r\nare followed through from the impulse to unity which existed after the successful operation\r\nof the Peace Ballot, through the fundamental division between pacifist and \u003ci\u003epacificist\u003c/i\u003e\r\noutlooks which began with the War in Abyssinia, to the final split of the movement when its\r\nlarge \u003ci\u003epacificist\u003c/i\u003e majority accepted the necessity for war with Germany. The character of local\r\npeace movements, it is suggested, depended very much on the political, social and economic\r\ncontext in which they flourished. The history of the Sheffield movement is characterised by\r\ncompetition between three groups for its leadership. The Labour Party dominated its\r\npolitical relationships but is scarcely to be understood without reference to Communistinspired\r\nefforts to form a Popular Front of socialist and liberal groups. The Anglican Church\r\nleadership provided a strand of \u003ci\u003epacificism\u003c/i\u003e difficult to distinguish from defencism but\r\nnevertheless crucial to the position of the majority of the movement at the outbreak of war,\r\nwhile Nonconformism dominated the city\u0027s pacifism. Despite the strength of both these\r\nparty political and religious influences, however, the League of Nations Union led the\r\nSheffield movement during two key periods. The growth of the \u003ci\u003epacificist\u003c/i\u003e consensus, which\r\nat a national level saw the formation of a coalition spanning both right and left of British\r\npolitics, is a stronger theme in Sheffield than the move of the minority pacifist wing into\r\nabsolutism. The impact of a new \"realism\" on the \"utopian\" theories of the first decade and a\r\nhalf after the Great War is generally to be found in the move from the quasi-pacifism of the\r\nearly thirties, which found expression on the Left in Sheffield in the policy of working-class\r\nwar-resistance, to the rather crude version of League of Nations inspired Collective Security\r\nembodied in the mutual defence pacts and guarantees sought by Britain after March 1939.\r\nThe ideological complexion of Sheffield\u0027s Left-wing and its importance in the deliberations\r\nof the Sheffield Trades and Labour Council ensured that, overlaying the general move\r\ntowards \u003ci\u003epacificism\u003c/i\u003e, were a number of specific objections to aspects of the \"realist\" policies\r\nespoused by the national Labour leadership rooted in Communist Party policy and\r\nopposition to Chamberlain\u0027s National Government. The superficial similarities between\r\ncommunist objections to specific aspects of war preparations and the policies of the pacifist\r\nrump of the peace movement gave the impression that Sheffield was a centre of opposition\r\nto the war. The fundamental division between the \u003ci\u003epacificist\u003c/i\u003e and pacifist approaches ensured.\r\nhowever, that these two groups, the only remaining anti-war elements of the Sheffield\r\nmovement after October 1939, never entered a formal alliance. The Communist Left\r\nremained wedded to interaction with working class groups while the remaining pacifists\r\nbecame isolated and increasingly quietist under the relentless pressure of the pro-war\r\nmajority including their former \u003ci\u003epacificist\u003c/i\u003e colleagues in the peace movement.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Stevenson, David Anthony"],"dc:date":"2001-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382064,"sim:weight":0.435106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929824,"sim:weight":0.376708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99015,"sim:weight":0.360854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47025,"sim:weight":0.33484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99294,"sim:weight":0.327086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48390,"sim:weight":0.323104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382015,"sim:weight":0.321412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381993,"sim:weight":0.321051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382035,"sim:weight":0.314996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29218,"sim:weight":0.305218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44396,"sim:weight":0.304001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352182,"sim:weight":0.289277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46762,"sim:weight":0.27981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.273348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18028,"sim:weight":0.262908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382061,"sim:weight":0.257011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99207,"sim:weight":0.244196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382080,"sim:weight":0.235106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44140,"sim:weight":0.233239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352112,"sim:weight":0.232862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Central to each project was the use of reflection as a primary tool for ensuring the impact of the professional development and for stimulating a teacher-led process. Reflective practice was developed through the use of three approaches; audio sound bites, reflective blogs, and reflective discussions. The teachers used reflection as a means of self-evaluation as well as evaluation of their action research interventions.  The reflective practice which the teachers engaged in enabled them to think carefully about what was taking place in a given situation during their designed interventions, to identify suitable options, and to make conscious choices about what to do in order to make a difference.  The participating teachers all concluded that reflective methods that enable self-reflection as well as reflection upon designed classroom interventions are hugely beneficial to effective CPD for teachers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bevins, Stewart","Jordan, Julie","Perry, Emily"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":82326,"sim:weight":0.526404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387062,"sim:weight":0.515977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44940,"sim:weight":0.514808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47354,"sim:weight":0.465604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83091,"sim:weight":0.455199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573456,"sim:weight":0.428777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383671,"sim:weight":0.427167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98717,"sim:weight":0.409052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83089,"sim:weight":0.39899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98603,"sim:weight":0.379773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18074,"sim:weight":0.374825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384103,"sim:weight":0.364783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.347144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383477,"sim:weight":0.341208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99060,"sim:weight":0.324851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.311379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387068,"sim:weight":0.305145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57648,"sim:weight":0.298733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.297146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83139,"sim:weight":0.287424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recruitment was in two phases: the\r\nfirst consisted of women who were contacted via survivors\u0027 support groups; the\r\nsecond, of midwives recruited via the letters pages in midwifery journals.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe exact extent of childhood sexual abuse is unknown, but some authorities\r\nsuggest that as many as half of all women will experience some kind of sexual\r\nabuse in their lives (Kelly 1988). The shame and secrecy which surrounds CSA\r\nmeans that, inevitably, it is under-reported and consequently many maternity\r\nworkers will inadvertently come into contact with survivors during their working\r\nlives. The aim of this study was to gain an insight into the lived experiences of\r\nsurvivors of sexual abuse during pregnancy, birth and early parenting, in order\r\nto inform those working in the maternity services, to enable them to provide\r\nappropriate, research-based care for these women.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe project was undertaken from a feminist standpoint in that it was conducted\r\nthrough the promotion of a non-hierarchical reciprocal relationship between the\r\nrespondents and myself.

The interviewees appeared to have realistic expectations of the\r\nphysical sensations of labour but were unprepared for uncaring and impersonal\r\nencounters with maternity staff. Re-traumatisation was more often than not\r\nassociated with a routine-focussed approach by caregivers and failures in\r\ncommunication resulting in the women experiencing powerlessness, betrayal\r\nand humiliation. Good relationships with carers, in which the women perceived\r\nthemselves to be valued and respected as individuals appeared to have a\r\nprotective effect.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe data also suggests that there is no \u0027standard\u0027 approach to providing care for\r\nsurvivors of CSA, but that it is incumbent on practitioners to collaborate with\r\neach individual in order to discover how best to care for her.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Garratt, Elisabeth Featherston"],"dc:date":"2008-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383655,"sim:weight":0.380342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46560,"sim:weight":0.368897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17976,"sim:weight":0.360587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381903,"sim:weight":0.357096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384101,"sim:weight":0.355417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44915,"sim:weight":0.347932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2907,"sim:weight":0.346207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99172,"sim:weight":0.323109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45818,"sim:weight":0.31935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98600,"sim:weight":0.313324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383383,"sim:weight":0.312223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46638,"sim:weight":0.300844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383638,"sim:weight":0.296602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47200,"sim:weight":0.286294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383621,"sim:weight":0.276492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98713,"sim:weight":0.269259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99919,"sim:weight":0.268832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383577,"sim:weight":0.248496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.246638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103921,"sim:weight":0.245336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Sheffield\r\nLabour Party pursued a policy of municipal socialism campaigning on a platform of\r\nservice provision to include housing, health, education and transport. Health and hospital policies were closely related. In hospital policy the Council operated within a mixed economy of health care to provide a municipal general hospital service.

The study required an engagement with a range of\r\nliteratures from marketing, consumer studies, popular music studies and cultural studies.\r\nThe key notions of \"circuit of culture\" and \"text\" were adapted to help guide the inquiry,\r\nand combined with social identity theory and branding theory. A broadly ethnographic\r\napproach, harnessed to a combination of social constructionist, hermeneutico-semiotic\r\nand discourse-analytical perspectives was used for the study. A range of data collection\r\nmethods was used, including participant observation, interviews with band and fans, and\r\nphotography. In three empirical chapters, data on three sites of cultural production and\r\nconsumption site are presented: cyberspace, museum spaces and gig spaces. The chapters\r\ndeal with, respectively, the construction of the New Model Army \"Family\" as a framing\r\ninterpretative resource for the band-fan community; the curation by the band of an\r\nexhibition of its art and artefacts in order to create a Family heritage; and the importance\r\nof live performances as Family \"gatherings\".

My key overarching argument is that identity/ies and values underpin and enrich fine art lecturers’ assessment practices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Orr, Susan"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2835,"sim:weight":0.338075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26502,"sim:weight":0.316868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4132,"sim:weight":0.263797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.263553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":691606,"sim:weight":0.245998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17991,"sim:weight":0.217326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.209901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98489,"sim:weight":0.202225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83349,"sim:weight":0.19966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386857,"sim:weight":0.182465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383540,"sim:weight":0.178599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666,"sim:weight":0.170299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106355,"sim:weight":0.165373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.16457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41233,"sim:weight":0.159574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2837,"sim:weight":0.159365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12367,"sim:weight":0.1544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18050,"sim:weight":0.153236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47274,"sim:weight":0.149796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4355,"sim:weight":0.147145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Their principal aim has been to allow designers and engineers to understand what it is like to use these products as an older person might use them, effectively prematurely ageing the user. Such suits have been highly successful but suffer several limitations in their use. In using mechanical stiffeners on the joints such as the stiffening effect of the suits depends on the strength of the user; weaker users will find their range of motion reduced more than stronger users. This also raises the question of the sensitivity of such suits; in reality motion restriction may be linked to pain and discomfort hence motion restriction is likely to be more psychological and musko-skeletal than current suits provide. Work has been ongoing at SHU to develop a suit that restricts motion by providing sensory feedback to the user. Specialist software was developed which set motion limits to goniometers which in turn would make motors vibrate if those limits were reached. This work outlines the development of this suit and initial applications for which it has been used.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yoxall, Alaster","Heller, Ben","Chamberlain, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.395287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.341792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.332769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.309634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.304564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.302698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.300336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.29664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.284448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.259551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.245729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100292,"sim:weight":0.212555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3172,"sim:weight":0.158498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.155995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.153373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.15155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3177,"sim:weight":0.149548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.149398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933590,"sim:weight":0.145884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.145124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Much has been written about thresholds for intervention in response to abuse of children within their families. When the alleged abuse or poor childcare practice is by professionals, the initial decision making is equally complex, but the thresholds for inclusion in the formal safeguarding processes have received less attention. The study responds to the gap identified by practitioners in determining the appropriate level of intervention to reported behaviours across a range of children’s services. It makes available summary descriptions of nine allegations reported between March 2008 and February 2009, in two Local Safeguarding Children Board areas. Descriptive accounts from the participants, obtained through semi structured interviews, provide insight into the actions taken and approach to decision making including the role of relationships. The descriptions included systematic information gathering and consultation with others, conducted within a tight time frame, which was not dependent on knowledge of safeguarding children procedures. The findings suggest that awareness of specific safeguarding procedures for the management of allegations did not enhance practice or decision making, and could operate to blur responsibility for decision making. Further data was drawn from semi structured interviews utilising vignettes constructed from the anonymised real cases to explore the levels of incidents reported across agencies. The finding that practice varied more between areas than between agencies suggested that responses were attuned to local interpretation and implementation of the national guidance. The comparison of responses across the study suggests that in some situations the current processes for managing allegations may not serve either the welfare of the child or the best interests of the worker.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rhodes, Caroline J."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4158297,"sim:weight":0.681567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382095,"sim:weight":0.671729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42083,"sim:weight":0.665887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47369,"sim:weight":0.663948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4152144,"sim:weight":0.660994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156755,"sim:weight":0.660119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156784,"sim:weight":0.656475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.655203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158085,"sim:weight":0.650201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17849,"sim:weight":0.648668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654845,"sim:weight":0.64814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160541,"sim:weight":0.64577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58509,"sim:weight":0.637618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160658,"sim:weight":0.637366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155839,"sim:weight":0.625143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41372,"sim:weight":0.623673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160457,"sim:weight":0.62262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775595,"sim:weight":0.620645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4152244,"sim:weight":0.619623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4157606,"sim:weight":0.619068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It will approach the issue by drawing on the author\u0027s experience from the 1990s and 2000s in working in the management of government-funded regeneration programmes in the UK. In this field there was a rigid benefits management framework, although it precedes the development of BRM.

At the same time, the nature of the Internet has been undergoing a revolution labelled ‘web 2.0’. Most web 2.0 tools are also designed to be mobile friendly, allowing reading and updating of web 2.0 content from mobile phones, and also featuring enhanced mobile affordances such as photo and video blogging (from cameraphones), and geotagging (from GPS equipped smartphones). Hence mobile web 2.0 provides a platform for wider access than traditional computing that is context independent, facilitating ‘authentic’ learning environments (A. Herrington \u0026 Herrington, 2007, 2006; Jan Herrington, Herrington, Mantei, Olney, \u0026 Ferry, 2009) beyond the boundaries of the traditional tertiary classroom. Thus mobile learning (mlearning) presents vast potential for appropriation within tertiary education. This paper presents an academics journey into the use and appropriation of mlearning within their teaching practice. This journey is based upon a four year research project into the potential of mobile web 2.0 (Cochrane, Flitta, \u0026 Bateman, 2009). Critical incidents along this journey are identified and examples given of how mobile web 2.0 has been integrated into the academics lifestyles and pedagogical toolkits. The paper outlines the significant events in the pedagogical development of two academics over this period of four years. Critical Incident Analysis is used to identify significant ‘eureka’ moments for the participants in their mlearning (mobile learning) journeys. Several ‘lenses’ are used to bring into focus themes that emerge upon reflection over this period, including: Communities Of Practice, the Social Construction of Technology, Actor Network Theory, Activity Theory, and Social Constructivism. The symbiotic relationship developed between the academic advisor (technology steward) and the academic teaching staff has proven a rich environment for harnessing educational technology to design social constructivist learning environments for different groups of tertiary students. It is hoped the insights gained will be useful for other academic staff wanting to implement pedagogical innovation, and for professional development staff seeking insights for facilitating academics to integrate educational technology into their pedagogies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cochrane, Thom","Bateman, Roger"],"dc:date":"2010-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.572283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Smartphone manufacturers have seen the potential to partner with online social software (Web2.0) sites (e.g. Flickr, YouTube, Vox, Ovi etc…) to produce a mobile computing platform to capture and share our daily lives with friends and family, anywhere, anytime. These tools can be utilized within tertiary education to create context independent collaborative learning environments. Pedagogical design of learning experiences using mobile web2.0 allows a tutor to create rich learning environments for students beyond the classroom or lecture theatre. This paper illustrates this by analysing students responses to a third year Product Design project that transformed a traditionally paper-based learning journal into an interactive, collaborative, online eportfolio using mobile web2.0 technologies facilitating an explicit social constructivist pedagogy. Students were provided with a Nokia N95 smartphone, a bluetooth folding keyboard, and a 1GB 3G data account. They created an online eportfolio, and used the smartphones to capture and record learning events and ideas from a variety of contexts. The learning outcomes included the development of a far more media rich and critically reflective collaborative experience than was previously possible using traditional approaches.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cochrane, Thom","Flitta, Isaac","Bateman, Roger"],"dc:date":"2009-04-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8932978,"sim:weight":0.076147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There are two basic recycling schemes in the UK; kerbside and bring-site schemes. With current kerbside schemes, when a householder becomes unable, through age, illness or disability, to physically move their waste containers (bins,boxes or bags) onto the pavement for collection, the refuse collection service provider will\r\nenter the property premises, take the containers out to the refuse collection vehicle (RCV), empty them before returning them to the starting point. Obviously, with bring sites, people travel to the site and place the recycling in the banks themselves.\r\nWith an ageing population, increasing numbers of older people are requiring specialist recycling services. These are likely to become more time consuming and costly\r\nas household numbers increase. Bring sites have obvious limitations for older people with their limited mobility and reduce strength. To date little or no previous research has been undertaken about barriers to recycling for older people and the implications to waste management providers of an ageing population.

Threads used within the industry have largely developed empirically from metal thread profiles. An improved understanding is needed so that problems associated with that process can be better understood and solved. Such problems can be manifest in damaged closures, ‘spinners’ and closures that are just too difficult to open. The term ‘spinners’ is used for closures that do not break the pilfer band (a tamper evident safety feature) when twisted. The same term is also used to describe closures that have been turned the wrong way (i.e. clockwise) on opening, stripping the thread whilst not breaking the pilfer band. To combat this problem it is desirable to produce a closure system that has a high torque when twisted in the wrong direction (known as the over torque) whilst maintaining good seal integrity and a low torque for correct opening procedure.\r\nA successful feasibility study was carried out to investigate the appropriateness of using finite element techniques to investigate closure systems and gain the required understanding to improve these systems.\r\nThe follow on project utilised these finite element techniques and experimental testing using a single-head capping machine. The Project focuses on the industry standard glass thread finish called the GF305 that utilises an extra deep, aluminium ROPP closure.

This is not just important for social equality but also for business growth through new products and services and through creating wider potential markets.\r\nConsumer packaging is a field in which many people, including young able bodied people, often struggle in relation to openability. Until now, the main thrust of inclusive design in the consumer packaging field has been driven by art and design disciplines, focusing on the shape and ergonomics of the packaging or cognitive solutions in order to make them easier to open.

This is not just important for social equality but also for business growth through new products and services and through creating wider potential markets.\r\nIt is a sad fact of life that as people get older there is a massive decline in their strength and dexterity. Due to the fact that we handle and manipulate so many things\r\nthroughout our life time, from the tiniest and most dexterous of tasks to heavy manual labour, this decline is very noticeable in our hands. In nearly all the actions that we use our hands for there is some form of grip used in order to hold onto an object before manipulating it. The natural decrease in strength combined with debilitating illness such as arthritis, means that hand grip strength or finger grip strength are very seriously affected.\r\nThis has a knock on affect of making it much harder to twist things or pinch and pull things. Therefore there is often a measured decrease in torque strength with age caused not so much by a decrease in wrist strength but more often than not by a decrease in grip strength.\r\nConsumer packaging is a field in which many people, including young able bodied people, often struggle in relation to openability. Yet it is present in even the most mundane and neccessary of every day tasks such as eating, cleaning teeth, even drinking. Human interation with consumer packaging requires a wide range of hand dexterity and strength and a variety of differing hand actions. This paper looks at just one such set of actions; that used to open bottles and jars. It outlines all the arguments for inclusive design, stressing the importance for both consumers and business. This paper also outlines an engineering design approach for inclusive design that uses real human factors as design limits, resulting in packaging that will be easily opened by all it’s end users without the expensive trial and error approach that has been used up to this point in time. This paper examines the affect of\r\ngrip strength on the required trorque to open closures and concludes that there is an optimum diameter for ease of opening that will decrease the required strength to open such closures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Langley, Joseph","Yoxall, Alaster","Janson, Rob","Wearn, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2005-05-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1594042,"sim:weight":0.587583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.320769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.297982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.277417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.248654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.248654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177014,"sim:weight":0.190405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337731,"sim:weight":0.133896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336949,"sim:weight":0.0986491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Lack of understanding of this psychosocial aspect of product or service use immediately compromises the product or services design and future success. Further, in attempting to alleviate one issue through improved design we may create others. There is then an inherent complexity in the provision of design\r\nsolutions that could be specific for each design. That the design process is complex and is involved in attempting to provide answers to \u0027wicked\u0027 problems (Rittel and\r\nWeber, 1973) is well understood. However, little work has been undertaken investigating the relationship between design solutions (either artefacts or services) and their effect on wellbeing. To that end the authors have undertaken a number of case studies outlining the complexity of design solutions, the unintended\r\nconsequences and the effects on wellbeing of the individuals studied. Further the authors attempt to develop enhanced design processes to understand the complexity of the design solutions proposed and improve their effectiveness.\r\nThe development of this understanding has required an interdisciplinary approach and has been a significant factor in arriving at the recognition of the importance of\r\nthese psychosocial attachments. Hence this work examines these case studies in detail and examines the benefits and issues of interdisciplinary research activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Langley, Joseph","Yoxall, Alaster","Craig, Claire","Reed, Heath"],"dc:date":"2011-07-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Against the backdrop of a contemporary event culture that steadily increases the daily dose of media stimulation, Webb seeks to create moments of interruption that allow you to recalibrate your senses.\r\nFor his sound installation in the Winter Garden he works with diverse recordings: the ambient sound of people within the building is mixed with sounds of the building’s inner workings and external sound sources from nature. The recordings are further defamiliarised by being played back through water rather than air in the post-production process. The mix is then presented through ‘surface exciting speakers’, which activate glass surfaces within the building’s architecture as speakers. As the glass building literally becomes the sounding board for the water-modulated sounds, pockets of the environment will be transformed into something more akin to an aquarium.\r\nBy altering the basic framework for the experience of the place, the piece attempts to create an alternative choreography for the way people may move through this environment, slowing down their pace and potentially opening up pockets of empty time for different thoughts and sensations.’\r\n\r\nApproach to the work:\r\n\r\nAdrift was constructed to enable listeners in the Winter Gardens to take time and open up to listening, to heighten another sense rather than just seeing with their eyes. The installation is in parts meditative and site specific being designed specifically for the Winter Gardens.\r\n\r\nI am particularly interested in areas of sound practice concerning listening behavior and ‘noise’ in our environments.\r\n\r\nThe recordings for Adrift were made with conventional stereo microphones and unconventional microphones such as hydrophones and contact microphones. Locations for these recordings included the Dorset and North East coast line and in the Winter Gardens itself.\r\nI have developed a body of work that uses unconventional materials to transmit sound.For Adrift I used ‘surface exciting’ speakers to activate glass and metal and transform them into speakers.

The Other cannot exist without something to be other than. It exists in opposition, often born from the thing it negates. In some sense the white gallery space can be seen as familiar and the work be considered ‘otherly’ or alien to this environment. A sense of displacement overcomes the uniformity of the blank space; while distortions of familiar sounds focus us back in on the minutiae of our experience.  There may be some comfort or consolation in this detachment, this sense of being out of time, as the work presented clearly demonstrates.\r\n\r\nAbout my personal piece of work: Far Beneath in the Abysmal Sea\r\n‘The title of this piece is taken from Albert Tennyson’s ‘The Kraken’. This sonnet subsequently inspired John Wyndam’s novel ‘The Kraken Wakes’. Using above and under water recordings the piece attempts to explore these worlds of the unknown underneath. The mysterious depths of the oceans remain largely unseen and unknown. The beast is suggested through exploration and intrigue until it finally reveals itself.’\r\n\r\nFor this piece I made recordings of the sea on the North East Coast and along the Jurassic Coastline.\r\nThese locations are captured and logged to become part of an expanding sound library.\r\nI used conventional microphones and underwater hydrophones to capture these recordings.\r\nThese recordings were the basis of the piece that were then edited and manipulated in the computer.\r\nThe piece demonstrates the physicality of the sea and takes the listener into the unusual and psychological sense of being underwater.\r\n\r\nThe piece is multifunctional with several outputs having been played in a gallery and is available on CD and online.","bibo:AuthorList":["Webb, Neil"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.293958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.270158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.269389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.257718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.246031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734362,"sim:weight":0.234195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.231129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.225191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.217985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both are enabled by replicators: memes or genes respectively. Whereas genes are the units of transmission of our biological inheritance memes are the units of transmission of our cultural inheritance. They cause organisations to settle into patterns, routines and habits of behaviour: manifestations of a particular memetic inheritance. These patterns enable the organisation but simultaneously limit its performance. Both systems share the evolutionary dynamic of adaptive radiation followed by stabilisation. Memetic examples include new markets, new technologies and new business ideas. Business theories and their derivative, managerial fads, are a class of memes. This paper illustrates the increasing returns dynamic in the evolution of management recipes by contrasting Business Process Re-engineering and the Learning Organisation. It ends with a plea for the Learning Organisations to retain memetic diversity rather than be trapped in sterile competitions to define an LO.

{"identifier":1594187,"ep:Repository":102,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Barriers to success? : Access entrants and social class processes in Higher Education","bibo:abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThe aim of this thesis is to explore social-class processes within higher education\r\nthrough a study of the experiences of mature, largely working-class, Access entrants. It\r\ndraws on data from a qualitative, longitudinal study of twenty-seven such entrants to a\r\npre-1992 university, a post-1992 university and a college of further and higher\r\neducation, all in the South Yorkshire region. The central finding is that, whilst all\r\nmature students entering higher education may experience some degree of disjunction,\r\nthis is frequently more intense for those from working-class backgrounds, although\r\nfactors of age, entry qualification and gender interact in complex ways to shape the\r\nexperiences of mature entrants. It is suggested that, despite important differences\r\nbetween higher education institutions in terms of access strategies, ethos, student\r\ncomposition and levels of student support, the academic stance on which they are all\r\npremised, with its distanced and nuanced impartiality, may constitute a subtle source of\r\ndisjunction for working-class students because it necessitates a detachment from, and\r\nsymbolic re-ordering of, their social worlds. As a consequence, working-class students\r\nin higher education are likely to feel that they are entering an alien world. Drawing on\r\nBourdieu\u0027s analogy of social life as game playing, it is contended that the working-class\r\nhabitus provides resources for dealing with the experience of higher education but that\r\nparticipation in the academic `game\u0027 has important consequences for selfhood and\r\nrelationships with significant others, marking a potential betrayal of working-class roots\r\nand a loss of the `sense of one\u0027s place\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nThe theoretical framework adopted in the thesis rests upon a reformulation of\r\nBourdieu\u0027s concepts and the methodological stance is one of critical realism. It is\r\nargued that social class operates at a number of distinct but interwoven levels. At the\r\nstructural level, class is viewed as a real economic and cultural phenomenon with\r\ngenerative mechanisms of which social actors may not be aware. Working-class\r\nstudents in higher education may therefore only partially recognise the class-based\r\nnature of their disadvantage. Indeed, the processes of misrecognition and symbolic\r\nviolence may encourage such students to believe that they lack the necessary skills and\r\nqualities to cope in this sphere. At the level of social action, however, class processes\r\nare implicated in the struggles for distinction in social life - material, cultural and\r\nsymbolic - of purposive and active social agents, although social classes at this level\r\nmay now operate more as modes of differentiation than as forms of collectivity (Savage,\r\n2000). It is contended in this thesis that the relationships between the structural and\r\ncultural dimensions of social class, and between each of these and social agency, are\r\ncontingent upon historical and social circumstances; these relationships can therefore\r\nonly be specified in concrete, empirical contexts. (This is clearly demonstrated by the\r\ncontingent combination of structural context, individual motivation and, in many cases,\r\nfortuitous events that lay behind the entry to higher education of the working-class\r\nstudents in this study. ) Following this, it is argued that the generative mechanisms of\r\nsocial class affect what happens in a contingent, rather than a necessary, way so that the\r\noutcomes of the struggles for distinction in social life are not fixed. For this reason,\r\nclass processes may contribute to the reproduction of existing patterns of disadvantage\r\nbut the potential is also there for change: in the context of this study, for a progressive\r\ndemystification of higher education and an increasing awareness among working-class\r\ngroups of its possibilities.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Bufton, Serena Anne"],"dc:date":"2001-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Governments of sub-Saharan Africa region have embraced the Community-based health insurance schemes concept under the health sector reforms, with momentous enthusiasm. They believe that these newly emerging health financing arrangements could easily be utilised as platforms for initiating Social Health Insurance strategies to reach the economically deprived people. Without such schemes, citizens would become poorer because they would have had to dispose of their family\u0027s wealth in order to treat a member who falls sick. Ghana, a developing country in West Africa has introduced a National Health Insurance Scheme, which is fused with Social health insurance and Community-based health insurance schemes. This study examines pro-active plans to address the financial viability of the schemes, to prevent them from going insolvent.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe study generally, investigates health sector reforms in the context of Ghana. Four operating District Mutual Health Insurance Schemes (MHOs) were selected using geographical locations, among other criteria, as case studies. Data was gathered through interviews. The findings of the empirical study were analysed and interpreted using social policy and community field theories with the support of available documents. The evidence from the study concludes that government\u0027s intervention (implementation of NIH Act 650) has increased and expanded the membership base of the schemes: from small group-based to district-wide schemes under the ambit of the District Assemblies. However, such intervention has equally led to diminished community initiatives in establishing, and the complete collapse of the original small group-based schemes. The study also finds among other things that:\r\n\r\n\u003col\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cli\u003eThe financial viability of the schemes depends on the provision of long-term government subsidy.

With treatment, the condition has a positive prognosis but ironically patients undergo treatment similar to that for invasive breast cancer.  There is a lack of longitudinal qualitative research studying women’s experiences of ductal carcinoma in situ, especially amongst newly diagnosed patients and how experiences change over time. \r\nMethods: Forty-five women took part in an initial interview following a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ and twenty-seven took part in a follow-up interview 9-13 months later.  Data were collected between January 2007 and October 2008.  Transcripts were analysed using a hybrid approach to thematic analysis.\r\nFindings: Women’s early perceptions of ductal carcinoma in situ merged and sometimes conflicted with their lay beliefs of breast cancer.  Perceptions and experiences of the condition shifted over time.  These overriding aspects were evident within four themes identified across the interviews: 1) perceptions of DCIS versus breast cancer, 2) from paradox to acceptance, 3) personal impact, and 4) support and interactions with others.\r\nConclusion: This study represents one of the few longitudinal qualitative studies with newly diagnosed patients, capturing women’s initial and shifting experiences and perceptions of the condition.  The issues identified need to be recognised in clinical practice and supported appropriately.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kennedy, Fiona","Harcourt, Diana","Rumsey, Nichola"],"dc:date":"2012-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77319,"sim:weight":0.390768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17869,"sim:weight":0.380683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386691,"sim:weight":0.347695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99469,"sim:weight":0.331964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":294473,"sim:weight":0.28072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23524,"sim:weight":0.278049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.268526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387247,"sim:weight":0.267665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.25861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46896,"sim:weight":0.249557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.245966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23317,"sim:weight":0.245511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76424,"sim:weight":0.239076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382087,"sim:weight":0.237814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.237553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":370451,"sim:weight":0.220556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46504,"sim:weight":0.204533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84947,"sim:weight":0.190475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177390,"sim:weight":0.116102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Colossal use of fossil fuel has created noticeable pollution problems contributing to climate change and health hazards. Silicon based solar cells have dominated the market but it is cost is high due to the manufacturing process. Therefore, the way forward is to develop thin films solar cells using low-cost attractive materials, grown by cheaper, scalable and manufacturable techniques.\r\nThe aim and objectives of this work is to develop low-cost, high efficiency solar cell using electrodeposition (ED) technique. The material layers include CdS and ZnTe as the window materials, while the absorber material is CdTe. Fabricating a suitable devices for solar energy conversion (i.e. glass/conducting glass/window material/absorber material/metal) structure. Traditional way of fabricating this structure is to grow window material (CdS) using chemical bath deposition (CBD) and absorber material (CdTe) using electrodeposition. However, CBD is a batch process and therefore creates large volumes of Cd-containing waste solutions each time adding high cost in manufacturing process. This research programme is therefore on development of an \"All ED-solar cells\" structure.\r\nMaterial studies were carried out using photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the electrical characterisation of fully fabricated devices was performed using current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements.\r\nThis research programme has demonstrated that CdS and ZnTe window materials can be electrodeposited and used in thin film solar cell devices. The CdS electrolytic bath can be used for a period of 7 months without discarding it like in the CBD process which usually has life-time of 2-3 days. Further work should be carried out to increase the life-time of this bath, so that there can be used continuously minimising waste solution production in a manufacturing line.\r\nAn efficiencies showing up to 7% was achieved for complete devices. However, the consistency and reproducibility remains un-resolved due to production of efficiencies between (2 - 7)% efficient devices varying from batch to batch. One of the reasons has been identified as the growth of CdS nano-rods with spacing between them. This is the first observation of CdS nano-rods and could open up many applications in nano-devices area. In order to improve the consistency of the solar cell efficiency, CdS layers should be grown with nano-rods aligned perpendicular to the glass surface and with tight packing without gaps, or with uniform coverage of CdS over the conducting glass surface.\r\nThe possibility of growth of CdTe absorber layers with n- and p-type electrical conduction using change of stoichiometry was confirmed using the results presented in this thesis. This is a key finding, important to form multi-layer solar cell structures in the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Diso, Dahiru Garba"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108874,"sim:weight":0.832885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108329,"sim:weight":0.831355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108676,"sim:weight":0.800586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85937,"sim:weight":0.767852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108364,"sim:weight":0.763653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108299,"sim:weight":0.691747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176856,"sim:weight":0.670619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81328,"sim:weight":0.631006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":957350,"sim:weight":0.530139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1015731,"sim:weight":0.523293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108788,"sim:weight":0.516465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109080,"sim:weight":0.500937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1140948,"sim:weight":0.492999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567285,"sim:weight":0.476794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848325,"sim:weight":0.475097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1140670,"sim:weight":0.473339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":956801,"sim:weight":0.472526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108050,"sim:weight":0.410952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656506,"sim:weight":0.389317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46257,"sim:weight":0.37885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An examination of selected works will give us the opportunity to look critically at the evolution of the computer desktop metaphor and its appropriation back into object based artifacts and to unpacking some of the theoretical implications implicit in these shifts in representation.\r\n\r\nThe selected works examined in the paper originate from a group of international artists who have been repositioning the use of the computer GUI within the realm of creative practice. These creative recontextualisations allow us to problematise our engagement with digital technology. Allowing us to question our experience of the GUI in terms of a personal, and broader communal context. As well as intimating the pivotal place that computer technologies have taken in our everyday social, cultural and increasingly our creative realms. The transformation from digital computer icon to material artifact engenders the potential of the computer GUI to become a precious, rarefied object, which commands value and prestige.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gwilt, Ian","Hoofd, Ingrid Maria","Tan, Margaret","Ying, Katharine Ho Kit"],"dc:date":"2008-07-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.36351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.301024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

He made a distinction between the holidays he spent with his family during the month of August and those voyages he took later, most often in September, with complicated itineraries. Freud prepared carefully for his trips, consulting tourist guides and other travel literature concerning the places he intended to visit attentively, especially those of the sites of classical antiquity, and of course, the famous Baedeker. The fifty-six letters and hundred and eighty-nine postcards of his travel correspondence with his family between 1895 and 1923 reveal his enjoyment of these holidays, his pleasure in his liberty, in getting a bargain, in the blue skies and the southern warmth, in the beauty of the landscape, in wine and food.

They are works of interrupted thought. The artist writes that she is sick of her thoughts, and copies her son\u0027s concordance as he observes \u0027elle est malade de ses pensées\u0027. A photograph of a woman lying back, her hair falling in an unlikely mass is countered by a text work in which Zola\u0027s novel Nana (a favourite recourse of the artist) has been digested according to light and lighting effects, including those of metaphor. It ends with the line: The hair, the beautiful hair, still blazed like sunlight and flowed in a stream of gold. Nana is a grotesque corpse at the end of the novel, and it is true that the photograph has an unhealthy cast. The artist practices her limited skills in watercolour, copying carte de voeux, which show the similar scene of snow, a river or stream, a forest, a village. She looks at the banal image for a long time, committing it to memory, then turns it over to look at it no longer, rendering then what she imagines was pictured overleaf. The watercolours are framed with their original, reversed to show the message, a wish for health, for a lovely year. These, she will say, are her good years. 1968 was a good year, too, and she is equally fond of 1848, 1871, and some years in the 1950s, working from her collection of French women\u0027s magazines, published at particular moments of insurrection or social change. Pictures are isolated from their backgrounds, reprinted, then coloured as faithfully as possible according to their original colour, which becomes a strange \u0027maquillage\u0027, or indeed, in Joan Riviere\u0027s term, a masquerade. And masquerade is a play on the imaginary, subject to the market of sexuality, which masks the object. They become grotesque, even though she tries to work as carefully as possible, really doing her very best not to spoil them, like a teenage girl in her bedroom (colouring in her idealised drawings of what she may wish to become). She stops when she finds herself applying too much colour, in too garish a shade, but a discrete application seems sadly insufficient. Nonetheless, she arrests herself at the point of violence to the image. A supposedly enticing picture (a woman lifting her hand to her face, turning her head, her hair flicking back in the other hand), however banal, is very easily turned into something ugly and clumsy, yet retains or reconstitutes a horrible attraction. It is monstrous, of course, in its overdone appearance of femininity, and each betrays something in its intersection with history. She imagines that her works are made with both care and taste, that they are discretely knowing with just a soupçon of intellectual quality, moderated by a soft, persuasive voice, with a harmony of style and discourse.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kivland, Sharon"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.520469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108197,"sim:weight":0.51022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108988,"sim:weight":0.47413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.447814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108313,"sim:weight":0.408848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108411,"sim:weight":0.325344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109077,"sim:weight":0.250217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108896,"sim:weight":0.222458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.202491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Today, seaweed is still part of the habitual diet in many Asian countries. Seaweed consumption also appears to be growing in popularity in Western cultures, due both to the influx of Asian cuisine as well as notional health benefits associated with consumption. Isolates of seaweeds (particularly viscous polysaccharides) are used in an increasing number of food applications in order to improve product acceptability and extend shelf-life.\r\nEpidemiological evidence suggests regular seaweed consumption may protect against a range of diseases of modernity. The addition of seaweed and seaweed isolates to foods has already shown potential to enhance satiety and reduce the postprandial absorption rates of glucose and lipids in acute human feeding studies, highlighting their potential use in the development of anti-obesity foods. As seaweeds and seaweed isolates have the potential to both benefit health and improve food acceptability, seaweeds and seaweed isolates offer exciting potential as ingredients in the development of new food products.\r\nThis review will outline the evidence from human and experimental studies that suggests consumption of seaweeds and seaweed isolates may impact on health (both positively and negatively). Finally, this review will highlight current gaps in knowledge in this area and what future strategies should be adopted for maximising seaweed\u0027s potential food uses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brownlee, Iain","Fairclough, Andrew","Hall, Anna","Paxman, Jenny","Pomin, Vitor H."],"dc:date":"2012-04-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2675203,"sim:weight":0.371983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It explores the benefits of using this approach, the challenges to be addressed, and suggest a framework for applying the approach to other local and national e-government initiatives. One of the key project objectives is to demonstrate through the pilot that implementation of the iSAC6+ system will provide value for money by delivering the desired benefits both to government office users and citizens.\r\nThe approach described here focuses on costs and benefits generated by use of the system. There are staff costs for training, support and operation, technical costs for integrating iSAC6+ in to existing systems and websites, and more significantly organisational costs for designing and implementing new procedures and working practices. Citizens too will incur costs to access and use the service.  In iSAC6+ we have created a model of costs and benefits which can be applied in the short term to the pilot, and in the longer term to a much larger number of public organisations. The aim of the Benefits Realisation model is to demonstrate that iSAC6+ is capable of delivering value for money, and thus to justify the investment needed for expanding its use.\r\nInformation Technology project success or failure is traditionally judged against objectives set during initial project planning. Enterprises, both public and private sector, have found this approach inadequate because long term costs and benefits do not occur until after the project has completed.  Benefits Realisation emerged in the 1990s and developed two roles: a discipline for anticipating and quantifying the expected value of a project in terms of the costs and benefits which will accrue after the project itself is complete; and an over-arching project management philosophy. The paper uses the case study experience to comment upon these two different perspectives. The model developed within the project is based upon the recognised public sector costing formula, the Standard Cost model (SCM) but goes much further by integrating it into a Benefits Realisation tool which creates an audit trail from organisational strategic aims through to detailed cost measures for both quantitative and qualitative incidences.","bibo:AuthorList":["Keefe, Terry","Bikfalvi, Andrea","Beer, Martin","De La Rosa, PepLluis"],"dc:date":"2012-04-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48424,"sim:weight":0.566959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.562654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.473448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.465028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.463973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090812,"sim:weight":0.463787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.463186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.421636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.393787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.393658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187723,"sim:weight":0.383703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.368575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.360565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.360565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.359335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193190,"sim:weight":0.354218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187597,"sim:weight":0.33487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.252286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The playlist, from which visitors can choose, surveys the rich source of inspiration that film and video artists have found in the subjects of youth and adolescence. Featured titles span the forms of drama, documentary, travelogue and artists’ film and video, and date from the 1920s to the present day. \r\n\r\nThe selections include tales of angst, confusion, delinquency, boredom, sexual discovery, empowerment, and poetic portraits of adolescent work, play and love. The films are about youth and the poignant moment of adolescence, but are a far cry from the ‘teen film’ genre targeted at a young audience. In these works we find that the very subject of adolescence is a ripe area for early-career and established artists and filmmakers to explore in countless innovative and often provocative approaches. Perhaps the indelibility of the very special period of transition from child to adult, with all the complications and thrills it can entail, is the attraction of this powerful subject to create visionary works.  \r\n\r\nTeenage Wildlife’s focus is a global one, and the subject is explored from far-off locations such as the Lower East Side of New York (a twelve-year-old boy’s first experiences of love in Peter Sollett’s Five Feet High and Rising) and Kosovo (the documentary/fiction amalgam of Birgitte Stærmose’s Out of Love). With special reference to Turner Contemporary’s setting, four films showing youth activities in Margate have been chosen, beginning with the colour-tinted Magical Margate (1925) and ending forty-five years later with All go Margate (1970), which sings the praises of the town as a ‘favourite family resort’.\r\n\r\nAlso included are works by acclaimed promo director Michel Gondry, designer-artist Mike Mills, legendary Free Cinema exponent Karel Reisz, and Water Lilies director Céline Sciamma. Selections from the field of artists’ film and video include works by Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor, Laurel Nakadate and Cordelia Swann. \r\n\r\nThe vidéothèque has been curated by Esther Johnson, an artist and film maker. Her work has been exhibited internationally in galleries and art fairs including Tate Britain, Tate Modern, Zoo Art Fair, ICA, London; Cornerhouse, Manchester; FACT, Liverpool; Istanbul Biennial; Site Gallery, Sheffield; and Sotheby’s, New York; at film festivals and events including BFI London Film Festival, Raindance, Science Museum, London; NASA, California; and International Documentary Festival, Amsterdam. Her  work has also been broadcast on BBC television and radio. In addition to her practice, Johnson is an independent film/video curator, and Senior Lecturer in Filmmaking at Sheffield Hallam University, UK. In 2008 she was nominated for the Northern Art Prize. www.blanchepictures.com","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, Esther"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Elevation comprises two concurrent elements: a sequence of ten fixed-camera portraits from carefully selected vantages around the estate; and a voiceover interview with longtime Park Hill caretaker Grenville Squires, who eloquently describes the structure\u0027s successes and failures. Above all, Elevation is a poignant memento of a turning point in the estate\u0027s history, as the last embers of its communal ideal flicker out, and the first glimmers of its coming second life can be sensed. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.blanchepictures.com/films/elevation.htm\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sheffield Pavilion 2009 is a limited edition DVD of specially commissioned and existing video works by eleven Sheffield-based artists Richard Bartle, Chloë Brown, Katie Davies, Hondartza Fraga, Steve Hawley, Esther Johnson, Tony Kemplen, Haroon Mirza, Paul Morrison, No Fixed Abode and Third Angel.\r\n\r\n\u0027Elevation\u0027 was commissioned by Sheffield Contemporary Art Forum for \u0027The Sheffield Pavilion 2009\u0027 Exhibition/DVD/Book project.

In Experiment 1, socially anxious participants (relative to less anxious participants) exhibited an attentional bias toward social threat words in a Visual Dot Probe task. However, socially anxious participants who formed implementation intentions designed to control attention did not exhibit this bias. Using a spatial cuing task, Experiment 2 showed that forming implementation intentions also promoted rapid disengagement from threatening stimuli. Experiment 3 ruled out the possibility that implementation intentions were effective merely because they provided additional goal-relevant information. In Experiment 4, participants gave a speech and subsequently rated their performance. Forming implementation intentions prevented the underestimation of performance that characterises socially anxious individuals. Together, the findings suggest that forming implementation intentions may provide an effective means of handling self-regulatory problems in social anxiety.","bibo:AuthorList":["Webb, T.

The potential for smartphones in education builds upon experience described in the extensive literature on mobile learning from the previous decade which suggests that the ubiquity, multi-functionality and connectivity of mobile devices offers a new and potentially powerful networked learning environment. This paper reports on a collaborative study conducted by an undergraduate student with the support of two members of academic staff. The research sought to establish the extent to which students are autonomously harnessing smartphone technology to support their learning and the nature of this use. Initial findings were explored through student interviews. The study found that students who own smartphones are largely unaware of their potential to support learning and, in general, do not install smartphone applications for that purpose. They are, however, interested in and open to the potential as they become familiar with the possibilities for a range of purposes. The paper proposes that more consideration needs to be given to smartphones as platforms to support formal, informal and autonomous learner engagement. The study also reflects on its collaborative methodology and the challenges associated with academic innovation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Woodcock, Ben","Middleton, Andrew","Nortcliffe, Anne"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.579192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.572299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.569202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.565257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.552414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.55017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.544507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.526048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.521972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.503061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.486838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.459886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.438664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193234,"sim:weight":0.4145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.407935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193190,"sim:weight":0.405462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.400869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.397716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.364257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2801296,"sim:weight":0.307458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, there still remains a large gulf between the behaviour produced by our best robotic efforts and the richness of behaviour, learning and adaptability so obviously manifest in living systems.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOne approach to this problem is to characterise and model cognitive processes whose validity for engineering applications can be assessed through the building of (autonomous) robots working in everyday (non-toy world) environments. This approach will be described together with its emphasis on psychologically tenable theories of learning and cognition.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eStarting from a servo-based model of behavioural control proposed by William Powers, this treatment of adaptation and anticipation can be extended and developed for robotics.  The basic concept involves negative feedback loops closed by environmental interaction so that the error between an internal reference and a perception is minimised by action.  Thus behaviour is the consequence of tracking reference goals by reducing perceptual mismatch.  This idea will be discussed and lead on to an extension that offers a framework in which low level reactive behaviour can be integrated with higher-level schemas in a control hierarchy.  The relevance for real applications is illustrated by robot grasping experiments where a natural food product is to be grasped by a commercial assembly robot.  No prior knowledge of the product shape is available but a grasping algorithm is described that solves this problem by adapting the robot gripper orientation to perceived features of the product without operator intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding on these ideas, further developments are described involving 3D vision and pattern recognition, 3D registration, fast 3D reconstruction, real time tracking of faces and eyes, and a fully automatic real time 3D face recognition system. The implications of the research are considered for a range of application areas such as 3D CCTV systems, 3D animation and entertainment.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOther branches of this research have explored the scientific basis of robotics experiments, the rules that govern the interaction between a robot and its environment, and how these could be identified and modelled faithfully.

We argue the need for real time operation in a realistic scenario and highlight the required pre- and post-processing operations for effective 3D facial recognition. We focus attention to some operations including face and eye detection, and fast post-processing operations such as hole filling, mesh smoothing and noise removal. We consider strategies for hole filling such as bilinear and polynomial interpolation and Laplace and conclude that bilinear interpolation is preferred. Gaussian and moving average smoothing strategies are compared and it is shown that moving average can have the edge over Gaussian smoothing. The regions around the eyes normally carry a considerable amount of noise and strategies for replacing the eyeball with a spherical surface and the use of an elliptical mask in conjunction with hole filling are compared. Results show that the elliptical mask with hole filling works well on face models and it is simpler to implement. Finally performance issues are considered and the system has demonstrated to be able to perform real-time 3D face recognition in just over 1s 200ms per face model for a small database.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rodrigues, Marcos","Robinson, Alan","Sarrafzadeh, Majid","Petratos, Panagiotis"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Expert opinion from sociolinguistics, however, contends that such a view is the result of middle-class bias and cannot be scientifically justified.  In the 1960s and 1970s,such luminaries as Labov (1969) and Trudgill (1975) were at pains to point out to educationalists, with some success, that this \u0027deficit \u0027view of working-class children\u0027s  communicative competence is not a helpful one.  However, a close reading of  recent think-tank reports and policy papers on language and literacy teaching in schools reveals that the linguistic deficit hypothesis has resurfaced and is likely to influence present-day educational policy and practice.  In this paper I examine in detail the findings, claims and recommendations of the reports and I argue that they are biased, poorly researched and reflect the vested interests of certain specialist groups, such as speech and language therapists and companies who sell literacy materials to schools. I further argue that we need to, once again, inject the debate with the social dimensions of educational failure, and we need to move away from the  pathologisation of working-class children\u0027s language patterns.","bibo:AuthorList":["Grainger, Karen",","],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108621,"sim:weight":0.541045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.505899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85785,"sim:weight":0.50449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.452456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.448446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108327,"sim:weight":0.401212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9127185,"sim:weight":0.12101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Without firm evidence of the benefits of PBL, educationalists in mental health might be reluctant to view it as an option in curricula design. This UK study examined the experiences of pre-registration post-graduate mental health student nurses undertaking a 2-year educational course in which all teaching and assessment followed a PBL philosophy. Focus groups were used throughout the course to elicit in-depth qualitative data that was analysed by applying a constant comparative method. The analysis of the data uncovered the following broad themes: ‘moves to autonomy, ’surviving the groups\u0027 and ‘the impact of PBL’. The findings show that participants had mainly positive experiences and gained a range of study and interpersonal skills central to mental health nursing. Participants described initial anxieties resulting from engagement in PBL. However, they increasingly gained confidence in this approach, exercising increasing control over the PBL process. Despite this increased autonomy, participants continued to value the input of skilled facilitators.

It was shown again in 2009 in a group exhibition entitled, \u0027Tier-Perspektiven (Animal Perspectives)\u0027 at the Georg-Kolbe-Museum in Berlin. This installation is part of Brown’s long-standing research into the use of anthropomorphism in children’s narratives to deliver and make palatable stark messages about the human condition. Parallels can be seen with children’s fiction, in which animals are often employed as metaphors for aspects of human experience in order to distance the audience from the horror of death, violence and destruction. \r\n\r\nThe installation includes three pieces: \r\n\r\n•\tThe first piece combined a large helium-filled inflatable black cloud with a small white, mounted mouse in the warehouse-like space of the gallery.\r\n•\tThe second placed a white mounted mouse in front of an industrial roller.  \r\n•\tThe third element was a limited edition artist’s publication entitled \u0027Some Things That Fell\u0027.\r\n\r\nA huge black cloud hovers in an empty industrial building above a tiny white mouse. Another mouse stands frozen to the spot in front of a hulking piece of machinery. This is a roller, a machine used to flatten road surfaces. The helium-filled black cloud acts as a harbinger of doom occupying and trapped within an enclosed space. It is reminiscent of the kind of black clouds found in cartoons such as “Peanuts” or “Tom \u0026 Jerry”. \r\n\r\nOne strong influence for the confrontation between the roller and the mouse, is the iconic image of the “lone rebel” standing in front of a line of tanks during the Tiananmen Square protests of June 5th 1989. This is a defining moment in time, a frozen moment where the outcome is not clear. Brown\u0027s use of taxidermy is a longstanding feature in her work and it is featured here in the white mouse. She says she is drawn to taxidermy “not because it symbolizes death, but because it is death”. Brown is fascinated by the filmic freeze frame and she sees taxidermy as a form of 3d freezeframe. This is evident here in two pieces of work that depict moments frozen in time.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Chloe"],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85495,"sim:weight":0.265629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.263871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734401,"sim:weight":0.241683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.239072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108351,"sim:weight":0.230826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109077,"sim:weight":0.225807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.220739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.211195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.210175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.205202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The intention was academic: to exhibit and examine new ways in which animals appear in contemporary art and the contingent ethics and aesthetics to which such practice may be subject.\r\n\r\nThe curatorial policy of The Animal Gaze was to avoid representations of animals which regularly appear elsewhere in the visual culture of our own species: ie, no animals as decoration, nor status symbols and vehicles for ancient mythology or totemic ritual. Any objects of affective or pathetic fallacy on display here were unconventional. Much was omitted - general animal portraiture and wildlife studies, anthropomorphs, regular animal/human hybrids and ironies around stuffed toys – questions already asked and answered over the years.\r\n\r\nInstead, The Animal Gaze showed stances outside anthropocentrism, deconstructions of species taxonomy, constructions of the idea of difference and documentation of the consequences of indifference. At the same time, these works about animals and humans perhaps confirmed a trend discernible in recent art - an ascendancy of meaning or ambiguity over ineffability and surface, a move away from the gigantic, as well as more evidence of the profile afforded now to artist collaboration and cross-disciplinary research.\r\n\r\nArtists: Daniel Andersson, Angela Bartram, Sarah Beddington, Catherine Bell, Suky Best, Stephanie Black, Andrew Bracey, Mary Britton Clouse, Rich Broomhall, Chloë Brown, Paul Bush, Mircea Cantor, Marcus Coates, Nicky Coutts, Roz Cran, Matilda Downs, Roswitha von der Driesch \u0026 Jens-Uwe Dyffort, Tessa Farmer, Kate Foster, Hayden Fowler, Kathy High, Kate James, Jacob Cartwright \u0026 Nick Jordan, Cathryn Jiggens, Jo Longhurst, Kate MccGwire, Rosemarie McGoldrick, Aurelia Mihai, Daniel Mijic, Roz Mortimer, Melody Owen, Nicola Oxley, Kate Potter, Barbara Rauch, Andrea Roe, Claire Rousell, Clara Rueprich, Helen Sear, Snaebjornsdottir/Wilson, Miranda Whall, Martin White.\r\n\r\nCurated by Rosemarie McGoldrick\r\n\r\nChloë Brown showed the film, \u0027Dear One\u0027 and the installation, \u0027They Abide and They Endure\u0027.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Chloe"],"dc:date":"2008-11-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The case studies presented here outline recent work conducted through ‘Innovation Futures’, a Sheffield Hallam University project which aims to contribute to the development of a region-wide culture of innovation and to create strong links between businesses and the University. The multidisciplinary team, based across Sheffield Business School and the Cultural, Communication and Computing\r\nResearch Institute, has worked with numerous companies from the manufacturing and service sectors in the last three years.\r\nThrough a strong process of collaboration throughout the stages of problem structuring,problem investigation, and realisation of findings in practice, the work has sought to help businesses improve processes and, ultimately, performance via a range of analytical measures. By employing a holistic approach to understanding the social-cultural nature of the workspace through the integrated use of Social Network Analysis, Space Syntax and participatory design methods, managers have been able to develop a much greater level of reflexive management practice through their experiences of collaborative research. There is increasing recognition that organisational creativity is not formed through the innate attributes of the individual but is instead a wholly social process involving complex phases of interaction thus making the socio-spatial environment of the organisation, within which such phases are carried out, a key determinant of success.\r\nThis environment is both shaped, and also shapes, those within it through the requirements of organisation and it is through the experience of transdisciplinary boundary spanning that both academic institution and business can help form research driven management practices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dobson, Stephen","Barton, Rachel","Suckley, Louise","Rodriguez, Liliana"],"dc:date":"2012-06-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

After two years of negotiations between the Wellcome Trust, Imperial War Museum and Ministry of Defence, David Cotterrell was invited to observe the Joint Forces Medical Group at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. \r\n\r\nFocusing on these experiences and their inevitable aftermath, Cotterrell produced a new body of photographic and video work. Two films explore the transport and treatment of casualties during a Major Incident. In Serial Loop the sound of a continuously arriving and departing Chinook helicopter accompanies images of a bleak and wasted landscape. A fire rages in the distance while antiquated ambulances lumber along to take wounded to treatment areas. Green Room gives an alternative vision of the same event. Medics wait for their assigned patients, their bodies and faces concentrated on the tasks to come over the next four hours, like actors preparing to go on stage.\r\n\r\nA series of photographic works, Sightlines, Principals and Supernumerary are arranged as diptychs and triptychs. Shot in the Operating Theatre, these images reference painters famous for their use of chiaroscuro. The lighting and formal arrangements caught in the artist’s lens for a moment distract the viewer’s gaze, suggesting the sublime beauty within horror, the human scale compassion in the face of destruction.\r\n\r\nA further series of images, Gateway, documents the handing over of casualties as they pass from Camp Bastion to Selly Oak, Birmingham. Transferred from one plane to another in the middle of the night on Kandahar’s airstrip, the wounded are sedated and virtually unaware of their journeys. The grandiose scale of the planes belies the absolute fragility of their human cargo, soldiers who may take years to recover from wounds sustained in the fraction of a second. Cotterrell’s work for the exhibition reflects on a brief period of time in Helmand Province, in which two British soldiers died, 29 were wounded in action, 74 were admitted to the field hospital, 71 Aeromed evacuations were recorded and an undisclosed number of civilian, insurgent and Afghan National Army soldiers were treated.\r\n\r\nThis material was developed by David Cotterrell during a period of research commissioned by the Wellcome Trust. Cotterrell\u0027s work was enabled by the Ministry of Defence, who facilitated his stay at Camp Bastion in November 2007, and was further supported by the RSA, who invited him to stay in Kabul for a month in early 2008 in order to view an alternative aspect of Afghanistan.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cotterrell, David"],"dc:date":"2009-01-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.391267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.38514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.374008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.36655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29418,"sim:weight":0.360112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Their meanings and roles in society have changed over time and have been interpreted in a variety of ways by different groups of people around the world. In this thesis, I focus on the \u0027creative industries\u0027, a term that has only become prominent in the UK since the late 1990s, in national economic and cultural policy, and in arts and social inclusion literature. Although a lot has been written on the important role of the creative industries in the economic growth of cities, regions and the nation, there has been very little research conducted on the subject of work in the creative industries, and even less on gender and work. Thus I aim to build upon a small area of literature, by focusing on the gendering of work in the context of Sheffield\u0027s Cultural Industries Quarter, an area that houses numerous creative industries organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe study is based on a social constructionist epistemology. In my research I have been concerned with, and involved in, sense-making practices within creative industries discourse, including policy documents, conference proceedings and the accounts of participants that I interviewed in Sheffield\u0027s CIQ. Taking a social constructionist approach to gender means that in the thesis I present gender, not as something we inherently are, but as something that is accomplished through social interaction. The research is also informed by feminist and post-Marxist theories. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe thesis focuses on two key aspects of gender at work in creative industries discourse. The first relates to the way in which the creative industries have been constructed and presented as pioneers of the \u0027new economy\u0027. Creative industries policy literature uses terms such as \u0027enterprise\u0027, \u0027innovation\u0027 and \u0027creativity\u0027 to emphasize the economic role of the creative industries. I show how the discourse of the new economy is based on individualistic ideologies which mean that arguments and campaigns for gender equality and other aspects of social equity are undermined. The discourse of the new economy promotes a version of the ideal worker-the entrepreneur. I examine how the entrepreneur is constructed in policy literature, at conferences and through interview talk, as the archetypal individual with certain personality traits. I demonstrate that the model of the creative entrepreneur is a masculinized one, that combines with gender divisions at work and in the domestic sphere to maintain and reproduce gender inequalities in creative industries work.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe second aspect of the gendering of work in the creative industries that I examine is the accounts of people working in Sheffield\u0027s CIQ. In particular I examine how they account for gender divisions and inequalities at work. I argue that the people I interviewed tended to justify gender divisions at work using a number of discursive practices. These practices draw on gendered discourses and thus contribute to maintaining and reproducing gender inequality. I also explore the examples in the accounts of resistance to gender inequality. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe thesis is based on interdisciplinary research, which draws on sociology, psychology, cultural and urban studies. The aim is for the thesis to be a useful addition to critical writing on gender and work, the creative industries and enterprise culture. \u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Tams, Elly"],"dc:date":"2003-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A further aim was to implement and evaluate such an intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eA qualitative interview study was conducted with 18 adolescents in order to inform the development of measures for a longitudinal questionnaire study. The questionnaire study was conducted with 291 adolescents to assess which of 17 predictor variables were best at discriminating between less effective and more effective contraceptive users. Analysis identified three variables, from the original 17 predictors, to target within an intervention, namely self-efficacy, control beliefs and anticipated regret.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eMaterials for four intervention conditions were developed. One condition focused on manipulating the similar constructs of self-efficacy and control beliefs, a second focused on anticipated regret, a third combined the materials from the first two conditions, and a fourth acted as an information-only control. Baseline measures of control beliefs, self-efficacy and anticipated regret were taken from 414 adolescents, alongside measures of stages of change (SOC from the transtheoretical model; TTM; Prochaska \u0026 DiClemente, 1983), the other constructs from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB, Ajzen, 1988), and a self-report measure of behaviour. One week later, the intervention was implemented and immediate post-intervention measures of the psychological variables taken. Four to five weeks post intervention follow-up measures of the psychological constructs, SOC and behaviour were taken. Analysis of the data showed that levels of five psychological constructs, including self-efficacy, anticipated regret and intention to use contraception had significantly increased over the course of the intervention. Self-reported contraceptive behaviour also showed significant increases amongst a sub-sample of sexually active participants who had relatively low intentions to use contraception at the outset of the intervention. This increases occurred however, regardless of the condition of the intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThese findings represent an extremely positive outcome for behavioural change research and have important wider implications. Since it seems likely that the questionnaires rather than intervention materials were responsible for observed changes, the findings demonstrate the difficulty in differentiating between the impact of actual intervention material and the questionnaires used to measure their effectiveness. There is also evidence that it may be advantageous to tailor future interventions to specific sub-groups of populations. Suggestions for future research are provided and the implications of the findings for pregnancy prevention within the UK are also addressed.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Katherine Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2006-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The empirical work of this research is based on the data on university student entry qualifications and degree results from two new universities and the interviews with 18 members of academic staff from a new university.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis research contains two main parts both aimed at the question of the feasibility of constructing and using value-added as a performance indicator. The first part of this research developed a method of calculating value-added in higher education in the UK, and this method was used to measure value-added at the two institutions at course, school/departmental, and institutional (cohort) level. This was intended to discover the feasibility of developing a method to quantify the relationship between entry qualifications and degree results. The second part of the study used the value-added results obtained from the first part of the study to interview (semi-structured interview) academic staff to investigate their views on whether these value-added results can be used to indicate quality of teaching. In this case the question addressed was the perceived utility of the measure and its acceptability.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe first part of the study found that the method of calculating value-added developed can be used to identify variations in value-added at course (course with large number of students), school/departmental, and institutional (cohort) level, and this method has advantages over the main existing value-added measurements, Index methods and the Comparative method. The second part of the study suggested that academics found it acceptable if the value-added results were used to identify problems, nevertheless, they argued that the value-added results can not directly indicate quality of teaching. The difficulties with directly using value-added results to indicate quality of teaching are summarised into the following aspects: the concept of value-added, comparability, factors which have impact on student academic achievements, factors which have impact on how accurately degree results can reflect students\u0027 true achievements.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt is concluded that the method of calculating value-added developed in this research can be used to identify problems in higher education in the UK, but it can not be used directly to indicate quality of teaching.

To focus the discussion a number of applications of meme theory are reviewed to raise specific issues which ought to be the subject of empirical investigation. Subsequently, the empirical studies conducted to date are assessed in terms of the progress made and conclusions for further work are drawn.\r\n\r\nFindings: The paper finds that the key questions posed by memetic theory have yet to be addressed empirically and that a recurring weakness is the practice of assuming the existence of a replicating unit of culture which has, however, yet to be demonstrated as a valid concept. Therefore, an \u0027extra-memetic\u0027 methodology is deemed to be necessary for the development of memetics as a scientific endeavour. Narrative analysis is abducted as an appropriate avenue for the operationalisation of extra-memetic empirical research.\r\n\r\nOriginality/Value: The paper highlights inconsistencies, embedded in much of the memetic literature, which have not previously been recognised and the colloquial nature of the discipline is challenged from a positive but critical perspective. Consequently, the paper develops a rationale for the adoption of a widely recognised social science methodology for memetics which has been absent to date. In proposing narrative orientated research, knowledge concerning memes\u0027 validity can be facilitated whilst avoiding the current circularity in memetic truth claims.\r\n\r\nKey Words: Meme, Memetics, Narrative, Complexity, Evolution\r\n\r\nClassification: Conceptual Paper","bibo:AuthorList":["Gill, Jameson"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":112530,"sim:weight":0.372493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.121119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The growing use of sponsorship-linked events reinforces the need to understand the potential of such leverage strategies, thus the findings contribute to the body of literature on effective sponsorship practices. Findings from semi-structured interviews with Sponsorship and Marketing Managers suggest a shifting orientation among sponsors towards the pursuit of relational objectives. The privileged access to consumers afforded through sponsorship allows sponsors to manufacture opportunities to create intimacy with customers through sponsorship-linked events in relaxed, comfortable environments; thus sponsorship-linked events are positioned as a rich environment to add value to consumer–brand interactions and achieve relational objectives. Hosting specifically designed events affords sponsors an increased modicum of control over consumer–brand experiences in sponsorship environments characterised by a lack of control over sponsored property actions. However, this control may be eroded by social media technologies, which facilitate consumer–consumer communication around sponsorship-linked events. Social media, however, is proposed as a useful tool to elicit consumer feedback, addressing the misalignment between current sponsorship evaluation practices and emergent relational objectives revealed in the empirical findings. Therefore, successfully activating the sponsorship-linked marketing space demands an integrated and strategic approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Donlan, Leah","Crowther, Philip"],"dc:date":"2012-06-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The exhibition referenced the disorientation of a civilian observer within a militarised environment.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the gallery, visitors are immersed in a landscape that crosses the physical and the virtual. The disquieting Observer Effect presents viewers with a projected image of a distant, self-absorbed population. As audiences remain within the space, this virtual community grows in number and becomes distracted by their presence.\r\n\r\nSearchlight 2 reveals illusory human shadows traversing a low platform terrain, suggestive of the desert landscape as seen by an aerial drone. The unnerving movements of this unidentified population are computer-generated and directly mirror the actions seen in Observer Effect.\r\n\r\nApparent Horizon renders immersive, virtualised vistas of a desert landscape. As viewers, our role hovers between sublime reverie and the quiet anxiety between of periods of violence. The exhibition ends with a final cinematic flourish, enabling visitors to consider their role in the exhibition and its dialogue of control, observation truth and contradiction.\r\n\r\nMonsters of the Id was a John Hansard Gallery exhibition co-curated with Helen Sloan, SCAN, and is accompanied by a fully illustrated publication.

Uptake of lifelogging systems has generally been disappointing, however. One reason for this lack of uptake is the absence of design principles for developing digital systems to support memory. Synthesising multiple studies, we identify and evaluate 4 new empirically motivated design principles for lifelogging: Selectivity, Embodiment, Synergy and Reminiscence. We first summarise 4 empirical studies that motivate the principles, then describe the evaluation of 4 novel systems built to embody these principles. The design principles were generative, leading to the development of new classes of lifelogging system, as well as providing strategic guidance about how those systems should be built. Evaluations suggest support for Selection and Embodiment principles, but more conceptual and technical work is needed to refine the Synergy and Reminiscence principles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Whittaker, Steve","Kalnikaite, Vaiva","Petrelli, Daniela","Sellen, Abigail","Villar, Nicolas","Bergman, Ofer","Clough, Paul","Brockmeier, Jens"],"dc:date":"2012-04-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.0796702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Experimental assessments on the microstructural stability of this material are presented in this paper. Microstructural evolution has been quantified by high resolution field emission SEM and TEM. Electron diffraction and the combined XRD and Gaussian peak-fitting have been applied to investigate the coherency and lattice misfit between the gamma prime precipitates and the gamma matrix. The microstructure subjected to solution and hardening treatment consists of gamma-matrix and a network of carbide precipitates along the grain boundaries. Large quantities of fine gamma prime-Ni3(Ti,Al) precipitates were observed, with an  average size of 17 nm and coherent with the matrix lattice. The overall misfit has been quantified to be 0.28%. After long term aging at 700 and 725 °C for various periods up to 20,000 hours, gamma prime was still the predominant precipitate and mostly coherent with the matrix. A few needle-shape eta-Ni3Ti intermetallic precipitates were found in the grain boundary regions. The gamma prime size has grown progressively to 78 nm, accompanied by the gamma-gamma prime constrained misfit increasing to 0.50%. Moreover, the M23C6-type grain boundary carbides were found to have experienced morphological evolution, including the nucleation of Widmanstatten-type needles and their initial growth towards the matrix.","bibo:AuthorList":["Luo, Quanshun"],"dc:date":"2012-07-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":31313,"sim:weight":0.193178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26445,"sim:weight":0.17455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27098,"sim:weight":0.167347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27118,"sim:weight":0.15099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27120,"sim:weight":0.118934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85659,"sim:weight":0.0992268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Accurate self-reported ethnicity data would enable experts to assess inequalities in health and access to services and help to ensure resources are targeted appropriately. The aim of this paper is to explore the reasons for the observed gap in ethnicity data by examining the perceptions and experiences of healthy South Asian volunteers. South Asians are the largest ethnic minority group accounting for 50% of all ethnic minorities in the UK 2001 census.\r\nMethods:Five focus groups, conducted by trained facilitators in the native language of each group, recruited 36 South Asian volunteers from local community centres and places of worship. The topic guide focused on five key areas:1) general opinions on the collection of ethnicity, 2) experiences of providing ethnicity information, 3) categories used in practice, 4) opinions\r\nof other indicators of ethnicity e.g. language, religion and culture and 5) views on how should this information be collected. The translated transcripts were analysed using a qualitative thematic approach.\r\nResults:The findings of this Cancer Research UK commissioned study revealed that participants felt that accurate recording of ethnicity data was important in healthcare with several stating the increased prevalence of certain diseases in minority ethnic groups as an appropriate justification to improve this data. The overwhelming majority raised no objections to providing this data when the purpose of data collection is fully explained.\r\nConclusions:This study confirmed that the collection of patients‟ ethnicity data is deemed important by potential patients but there remains uncertainty and unease as to how the data may be used. A common theme running through the focus groups was the willingness to provide these data, strongly accompanied by a desire to have more information with regard to its use.","bibo:AuthorList":["Iqbal, Gulnaz","Johnson, Mark R D","Szczepura, Ala","Wilson, Sue","Gumber, Anil","Dunn, Janet A"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, most studies to date have explored screening uptake for a single cancer only. This paper compares breast and bowel cancer screening uptake for a cohort of South Asian women invited to undertake both, and similarly investigates these women\u0027s breast cancer screening behaviour over a period of fifteen years.\r\n\r\nMethods:Screening data for rounds 1, 2 and 5 (1989-2004) of the NHS breast cancer screening programme and for round 1 of the NHS bowel screening pilot (2000-2002) were obtained for women aged 50-69 resident in the English bowel screening pilot site, Coventry and Warwickshire, who had been invited to undertake breast and bowel cancer screening in the period 2000-2002. Breast and bowel cancer screening uptake levels were calculated and compared using the chi-squared test.\r\n\r\nResults:72,566 women were invited to breast and bowel cancer screening after exclusions. Of these, 3,539 were South Asian and 69,027 non-Asian; 18,730 had been invited to mammography over the previous fifteen years (rounds 1 to 5). South Asian women were significantly less likely to undertake both breast and bowel cancer screening; 29.9% (n \u003d 1,057) compared to 59.4% (n \u003d 40,969) for non-Asians (p \u003c 0.001). Women in both groups who consistently chose to undertake breast cancer screening in rounds 1, 2 and 5 were more likely to complete round 1 bowel cancer screening. However, the likelihood of completion of bowel cancer screening was still significantly lower for South Asians; 49.5% vs. 82.3% for non-Asians, p \u003c 0.001. South Asian women who undertook breast cancer screening in only one round were no more likely to complete bowel cancer screening than those who decided against breast cancer screening in all three rounds. In contrast, similar women in the non-Asian population had an increased likelihood of completing the new bowel cancer screening test. The likelihood of continued uptake of mammography after undertaking screening in round 1 differed between South Asian religio-linguistic groups. Noticeably, women in the Muslim population were less likely to continue to participate in mammography than those in other South Asian groups.\r\n\r\nConclusions:Culturally appropriate targeted interventions are required to reduce observed disparities in cancer screening uptakes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Price, Charlotte L","Szczepura, Ala K","Gumber, Anil K","Patnick, Julietta"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100417,"sim:weight":0.585399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85277,"sim:weight":0.211518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.155663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In developing a critique of the investor-owned firm, the role of legal membership and its link to legal identity in establishing a co-operative enterprise are evaluated. The purpose is to distinguish conceptually between common ownership, joint ownership and co-ownership, and their potential influence on future co-operative development.\r\n\r\nIt is argued that the mediation of business purpose and social identity through the choice of legal form influences the power and wealth sharing arrangements of a co-operative enterprise. Furthermore, the emergence of social enterprise has challenged co-operative models based on common ownership by a single stakeholder to produce hybrid models that express co-operative values and principles in new ways.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ridley-Duff, Rory"],"dc:date":"2012-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
