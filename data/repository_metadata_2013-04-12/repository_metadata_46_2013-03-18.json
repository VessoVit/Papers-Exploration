Schemes which have been described previously include gradiometric approaches and the use of \u0027back-off\u0027 coils. In each of these methods, however, the primary field cancellation was achieved only for a single transmitter/receiver combination. For the purpose of imaging, it would be desirable for a fully electronically scanned MIT system to provide a complete set of measurements, all with the primary field cancelled. A single channel suitable for incorporation into an MIT system with planar-array geometry is described. The transmitter is a 6-turn coil of wire 5 cm in diameter. The receiver is a surface mount inductor, of inductance 10 µH, mounted such that, in principle, no net primary field flux threads it. The results of measurements carried out with the single channel system suggest that the signal due to the primary excitation field can be reduced on average by a factor of 298 by the sensor geometry over the operating frequency range 1–10 MHz. The standard deviation and drift of the signal with the system adjusted for maximum primary field cancellation, expressed as a percentage of the signal when the receiver coil was rotated until its axis of sensitivity lay along the primary field, were 0.0009% and 0.009%, respectively. The filter time constant used was 30 ms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Watson, S.","Igney, C. H.","Dössel, O.","Williams, R.

The tests were repeated thrice for each category for quality assurance. This made a total of twenty-four control and CFRP externally bonded specimen. All specimens were tested under four point bending at a loading increment rate of 0.5kN, the lateral deflection were recorded regularly. The data processing consisted of load, deflection and moment curvature plots construction which were then used for analysis and observations.\n\nThe results revealed that there was a marked increase in the load bearing capacity of the timber flexural element, due to FRP strengthening and there was also an increased rigidity in the member characteristics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Faleye, Babatunde O.","Tann, David B.","Delpak, Ray"],"dc:date":"2008-03-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2698403,"sim:weight":0.296032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.262981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99041,"sim:weight":0.239266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108756,"sim:weight":0.229582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109201,"sim:weight":0.228645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99212,"sim:weight":0.211104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99168,"sim:weight":0.208015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.205066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99263,"sim:weight":0.200107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26001,"sim:weight":0.195347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18164,"sim:weight":0.184497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108701,"sim:weight":0.182033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930220,"sim:weight":0.167201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.157171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A SHM system could make some regular inspections unnecessary and allow maintenance only when required. Especially for composite aircraft structures where the incidence of fatigue is low, this technique could potentially be economical and improve the safety of the structures.\nThis paper shows that AE is an appropriate technique to monitor the health of composite materials online. AE is sensitive to micro cracks even before most other Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques can detect them. It is possible to determine the location and the type of defect (delamination, matrix cracks, fibre breaks) in the structure to a certain degree. Also the overall AE activity increases significantly towards the end of the life of the structure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aljets, Dirk"],"dc:date":"2008-03-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69474,"sim:weight":0.386168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5842356,"sim:weight":0.314583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26461,"sim:weight":0.285366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5575428,"sim:weight":0.254213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97202,"sim:weight":0.205879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27903,"sim:weight":0.200534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56626,"sim:weight":0.200141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.196414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24911,"sim:weight":0.193909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780140,"sim:weight":0.193041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26001,"sim:weight":0.176544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844211,"sim:weight":0.173162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using thermal (infrared) images as an example this paper builds on the author\u0027s previous work on automatically producing contour outlines of ROIs by applying noise removal and edge detection techniques. This study uses the outcome of the previous work to produce an initial and approximate ROI template shape from one of the images. This template shape is displayed as an overlay onto the second image together with control points which the user can\nmanually move into new positions that match the contours of the second image. Using this shift of the control points the second image can then be transformed (morphed) into the\nsame outline shape as the first image.\nIt is the aim of this work to compare the results of applying three different interpolation methods commonly used for\nscaling and transforming images. The measures used for comparison are the changes of temperature mean and standard\ndeviation in the ROIs resulting from transformation.

A number of mechanisms are identified on how higher education can contribute to improved economic performance within Europe. Two factors in particular—increasing university quality and the contribution to labour mobility—are identified as having important strategic implications. The article then analyses these two factors from the point of view of British universities, and concludes that there are real threats being posed to the position of British universities as a result of the Bologna process, due to differing perceptions of quality.

The activities included a preliminary workshop in the UK, a two-week visit to BIT and a workshop in Beijing. My study was conducted through a semi-structured interview programme with a wide range of academics and administrators. It was enlightening to find that a leading Chinese university, which operates within quite different systems and cultures from the UK, nevertheless has similar issues, imperatives and problems. My overall conclusion is that there is international agreement that research and scholarly performance underpins the credibility of academic staff to teach at a university, which in turn attracts good students and research staff.","bibo:AuthorList":["Neale, Richard"],"dc:date":"2009-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

One of the most promising approaches is based on multicasting. However, multicast solutions have to cope with several constraints as well as being able to perform in different environments such as wired, wireless, and ad hoc environments. Additionally, the scale and size of the Internet introduces another dimension of difficulty. Providing scalable multicast for mobile hosts in wireless environment and in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is a challenging problem. In\nthe past few years, several protocols have been proposed to efficient multicast solutions over the Internet, but these protocols did not give efficient solution for the scalability issue. In this thesis, scalable multicast protocols for wired, wireless and wireless ad hoc networks are\nproposed and evaluated. These protocols share the idea of building up a multicast tree\ngradually and recursively as join/leave of the multicast group members using a dynamic\nbranching node-based tree (DBT) concept. The DBT uses a pair of branching node messages\n(BNMs). These messages traverse between a set of dynamically assigned branching node\nrouters (BNRs) to build the multicast tree. In the proposed protocols only the branching node routers (BNRs) carry the state information about their next BNRs rather than the multicast group members, which gives a fixed size of control packet header size as the multicast group size increases, i.e. a good solution to the problem of scalability. Also the process of join/leave of multicast group members is carried out locally which gives low join/leave latency.\nThe proposed protocols include: Scalable Recursive Multicast protocol (SReM) which is\nproposed using the DBT concepts mentioned above, Mobile Scalable Recursive Multicast\nprotocol (MoSReM) which is an extension for SReM by taking into consideration the\nmobility feature in the end hosts and performing an efficient roaming process, and finally, a Scalable Ad hoc Recursive Multicast protocol (SARM) to achieve the mobility feature for all nodes and performing an efficient solution for link recovery because of node movement. By cost analysis and an extensive simulation, the proposed protocols show many positive features like fixed size control messages, being scalable, low end to end delay, high packet rate delivery and low normalized routing overhead. The thesis concludes by discussing the\ncontributions of the proposed protocols on scalable multicast in the Internet society.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Balas, Firas"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It has been frequently investigated in studies that deal with organisational strategies because of its potential impact on work attitudes such as job performance, productivity and organisational commitment. Although researchers have identified many factors that relate to job satisfaction, the majority of these factors can be grouped into two broad categories: (a) personal factors, and (b) environmental factors. Although personal and environmental factors are utilised as distinctly competing models of job satisfaction, researchers argue that the work environment is a better predictor of job satisfaction.\nMost, if not all, scales used to measure job satisfaction have been developed in Western countries. The aim of this study is to identify the determinants of job satisfaction in one of the largest public sector organisations in the United Arab Emirates, namely, the Dubai Police Force (DPF), and then, to develop a model of job satisfaction linking antecedents and consequences to job satisfaction.\nThe police, like any other public sector organisation, needs to develop and maintain a strong relationship with its human resources in order to effectively perform crime fighting and service provider roles. The issue of job satisfaction, particularly amongst Middle East police force employees, has received only limited research attention. Although some studies have tried to identify the indicators of job satisfaction among police employees, empirical findings on those indicators have generally been sparse and inconclusive.\nThe study employed a mixed method approach to meet its aims and to increase the reliability and validity of the results. The research strategy adopted involved sequential procedures. A qualitative study was conducted first to explore the research issue and to provide in-depth evidence for the research objectives (stage one). The results from the qualitative study were used to develop a scale. The quantitative study was carried out to explore the determinants of job satisfaction among the DPF employees (stage two). Five separate data collections (in-depth interviews, focus group, expert panel, pilot testing, and survey-DPF employees) were conducted, involving a total of 1,075 respondents.\nThe results of this study support the conclusions of previous research that the work environment is a better predictor of job satisfaction than individual demographic variables and that personal factors are of little value to understanding job satisfaction. The results show that 47% of the variance in job satisfaction scores can be explained by eleven environmental and four personal variables (in order of importance): salary and incentives, nature of the work, public perception, organisational policy and strategy, relationships with co-workers, supervision, promotion opportunity, performance appraisal, professional development, communication, job stress, nationality, sex, shift work and public contact. Accordingly, several policy implications of the findings and recommendations for future research are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abdulla, Jassem Mohammed"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

For women intending to give birth in the birth centre, this also meant having care transferred to the District General Hospital eight miles distant. Experiences of those women who had care transferred were of a particular interest. Even though transfer is a common occurrence, little research exploring the effects of this from the woman‘s perspective has been carried out.\nThe study was qualitative, using thematic analysis based on Gadamerian phenomenological principles. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with a purposeful sample of twenty women who described their antenatal experiences. Five of the women were later transferred from midwifery-led to obstetric-led care in the obstetric unit, with three of the transfers occurring during labour. A second interview was held with these five women to explore their experiences further.\nKey findings indicate that women choose the birth centre for its friendly, welcoming environment and woman-centred midwifery care. The influence and importance of family around the time of birth was a notable feature. Women transferred in labour subsequently experienced a different model of care, which for one woman meant that she remained empowered to make choices and decisions about her labour, whilst two other women felt some aspects of care to be mechanistic and impersonal.\nRecommendations from the study include further, larger scale research into women‘s experiences of transfer. Areas where specific guidance and education may be beneficial are suggested, to give a better understanding of those aspects of transfer that might affect women.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edwards, Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Maximal exercise in hypoxia is accelerated through a reduction in O2 supply with contributions from central and peripheral origins of fatigue. Changes in cerebral and muscle oxygenation have not been well characterised during incremental exercise in hypoxia. It is possible attainment of  O2peak is driven by the oxygenation profile of these tissues whilst changes in molecular biomarkers of endothelial function could provide some insight into the mechanisms driving systemic and regional O2 delivery and vascular hypoxic sensing capabilities. \n\nThe first study of this thesis examined the impact of acute hypoxia (FIO2 \u003d 0.12) on the cerebral and muscle oxygenation response to incremental cycling exercise using NIRS (n \u003d 14; age: 23 ± 5yr; height: 1.80 ± 0.07m; weight: 84 ± 8kg).  The profiles were characterised at equivalent relative and absolute exercise intensities and molecular blood-borne markers of O2 sensing and function were measured before and immediately after maximal exercise for changes in oxidative stress (A• and 3-NT), NO metabolites (NOx, NO3•, NO2• and RSNO) and cell adhesion molecules (sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1).  The key observations from this study were: 1)  O2peak decreased by 22% and the magnitude of cerebral and muscle deoxygenation (↓O2Hb and ↑HHb) was greater in hypoxia, 2) the slope for the relative HHb response was similar between conditions whereas there was an accelerated slope across the absolute workloads in hypoxia implying cycling performance was driven by a premature attainment of maximal O2 extraction capacity of the muscle, 3) there was no evidence suggesting cerebral O2 metabolism was impaired in hypoxia however since SaO2 was 78 ± 4% at PPO it is possible the reduction in systemic O2 delivery could have influenced central fatigue, 4) there was a tendency for a rightward shift in the cerebral THb profile in hypoxia and although muscle THb peaked at 80% PPO in both trials, the response also tended to be lower in hypoxia, 5) there was no change in oxidative stress markers and NOx after exercise, 6) RSNO increased and NO2• decreased after maximal exercise. The decline in NO2• was attenuated in hypoxia possibly due to a blunted NO2•-HHb-NO pathway and may explain the systemic hypoperfusion response, 7) The increase in sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 after exercise was augmented in normoxia, 8) Only when normoxia and hypoxia data was pooled was there a correlation between sVCAM-1 pre-post exercise and  O2peak.Intermittent hypoxia (IH) may be used to improve the efficiency of exercise training and as a pre-acclimatisation strategy prior to high altitude ascent. The purpose of the second study was to evaluate the efficacy of a 10 day IH regime consisting of 9x 5 min daily exposures of 9.5% O2 breathing followed by equal periods of normoxia on submaximal and maximal cardiorespiratory responses to exercise in hypoxia.  Additionally, cerebral and muscle oxygenation was monitored throughout incremental cycling to exhaustion and changes in NO metabolites (NO3•, NO2• and RSNO) and CAMs (sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1) were measured before and immediately after maximal exercise.  The key observations from this study were: 1) a tendency for IH to reduce submaximal  O2 and increase  O2peak in hypoxia, 2) IH increased the muscle THb response to exercise due an increased intercept for both the muscle O2Hb and HHb in the absence of any change in slope, 4) cerebral oxygenation increased (↑O2Hb) at rest and during exercise, 4) the reduction in nitrite was attenuated in the IH group whilst resting sICAM-1 decreased and the pre-post maximal exercise increase in sICAM-1 was augmented after IH.   \n\nIt is concluded that exercise performance in acute hypoxia is driven by the magnitude of hypoxaemia and an accelerated rate of cerebral and muscle deoxygenation.  Molecular biomarkers of endothelial function in particular, NO2• and CAMs, are also influenced by hypoxia and may contribute to the reduction in  O2peak. IH may be used to improve exercise economy and  O2peak in hypoxia by improving cerebral and muscle oxygenation in the absence of any change in central O2 delivery.  It is possible a recalibration of mechanisms that affect NO bioactivation could have enhanced vascular hypoxic sensitivity, O2 delivery and adaptation within brain and muscle tissue which ultimately translated to an improved hypoxic exercise performance. These results give motivation for athletes and mountaineers to incorporate an IH strategy prior to athletic performance at altitude.","bibo:AuthorList":["Woodside, John"],"dc:date":"2011-07-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Embedded microconsultants\noperate within the ambiguous and fragmented environments of their\nclient’s. Micro-consultants have to quickly make sense of their client’s working\nenvironments; adapting their operations and identities within these, to ensure\nappropriate advice and support is provided.\nWhen embedded, micro-consultants are usually expected to represent their client;\nwhilst also retaining their independence. Consequently, micro-consultants can\nsometimes be unsure who they represent (themselves or their client) and which\nidentity aspects they should be promoting.\nIdentity is the sum of, lifestyle, experiences and knowledge of an individual which is\ndeveloped over time, and provides awareness and guidance for future activities. To\nsome extent micro-consultants can choose which aspects of their identity they wish to\npromote or suppress. However, some groups can enforce aspects of their identity on\ntheir members which can contradict the micro-consultant’s base awareness and\nguidelines which can lead to dilemmas and uncertainties.\nThis research explores the interactions, changing identities and ensuing tensions of a\nmicro-consultant during a long term embedded assignment with a single client. The\nethnographic study uses authoethnographic narrative, along with participant\nobservation techniques and reflective practices, to provide insights on the key\ninfluences and other factors which can affect micro-consultant identities.\nThis thesis also provides an indication of the complexities and ambiguities faced by a\nmicro-consultant working on an embedded assignment.

The moral dilemmas and subsequent decisions facing managers in Britain and China today are important considerations both in terms of research knowledge and management practices.\nThis thesis is based on a triangulated cross-cultural comparative study of managers working for British multi-national corporations (MNCs) in China and the United Kingdom (UK). The study includes a postal survey and semi-structured interviews with Chinese and British managers of British MNCs that represent various industries. Alternative to traditional approach, the study has investigated the reality experienced by the managers in their decision making when confronted by moral dilemmas. The managers‟ moral behaviour processes are compared. For China-based managers, the recent moral, economic, social and cultural changes in modern China have contributed to the creation of ethical challenges. The dilemma for them is whether to follow local practices or the corporate standards of their British companies. For managers who are based in Britain, the centre of the moral tension is caused by reconciling personal ethical standards when making decisions to prioritise business rationale. Similarities found between Chinese and British managers show that despite moral struggles and discomfort suffered by managers, the decisions they finally make are determined by a leaning towards their companies‟ continued benefit.The evidence in this study suggests that managers‟ moral behaviour and final decisions are not often determined by what they personally think is morally right or wrong, but determined by their managerial responsibility, business pressure, commonly accepted practices, business culture and social environment, as well as changing economic environments. The components which play essential parts in constructing moral behaviour include managers‟ moral sensitivity, judgement, motivation and decisions. Business rationale and economic values of a decision are consistently shown to be the main reasons which can explain managers‟ decisions. This is the reality of managerial ethical decision-making interpreted and understood by the managers in China and the UK in this study.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhang, Jun"],"dc:date":"2011-07-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The art of our time, cinema reflects the postmodern fusion between machine and culture. As such, a crucial concern of this work, which addresses the impact of digital and visual technological developments in western societies and examines how such advances have come to supersede the historical and cultural imperatives, is precisely this resultant\nconfusion/fragmentation. The thesis analyzes how audiences interpret the current cinematic evolution, based on computer generated imagery, and how their subjectivity influences and impacts upon knowledge, ideology, culture and society as a whole. The creation of (un)realities in fictional spaces is most apparent in such concurrent places as the Internet, videogames and Virtual Reality, spaces which are certainly of interest to this thesis. However, it is also\ncrucial to note that recent years have seen a proliferation of films based on\nthe confusion between reality and unreality; and, further, that these have\nenforced a fear of being deceived by technology. Indeed, such post-classical\nfilms as Total Recall (Verhoeven, 1990), The Lawnmower Man (Leonard,\n1992), The Matrix (Wachowski and Wachowski, 1999) and eXistenZ\n(Cronenberg, 1999) materialize this fear cinematographically; a fear which is\narguably then assimilated by the spectators because this fear is projected\nonto their lives. In this respect, it is essential to be aware of the creation of\nnew spaces, identify related boundaries and understand our own creations in\norder to have control over our destiny. Concepts such as (un)reality, a hybrid\nof reality and fiction, are essential to refer to the inventions, contexts and\ninformation that appears in a world where atoms and a binary of 0s and 1s\nconstitute a dual code to which our lives conform.\nThe production of an original film, Luna (Diaz Gandasegui, 2007),\nworks in synergy with the written text to illuminate the complexities of (un)reality and the vital influence of technology on its confusion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Diaz Gandasegui, Vicente"],"dc:date":"2011-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Rubik lies within the Catchment of the River Fani which is remote, ungauged and characterised by frequent flooding, erosion and deforestation. Over the years these processes have had a huge environmental and socioeconomic impact on the residents of Rubik. Aid In Action was concerned about this situation and wished to provide a sustainable solution. Following discussions with staff at the University of Glamorgan, it was agreed that a sustainable solution was the development of an integrated hydrological decision support system for the whole River Fani Catchment. \n\nHydrological models can be a valuable tool, providing a common platform for experts, decision-makers and stakeholders for the sustainable management of catchments, especially when used within the framework of a Geographic Information System (GIS). Such models and systems require quantitative data of good quality over appropriate spatial and temporal scales. For remote mountainous ungauged river catchments in developing countries the development of a catchment model and management system is often complicated due to limited availability of such data. Very often, any available data are difficult to obtain; they could, for example, be scattered among local authorities and are generally in the national language of the country concerned, thus adding the challenge of having records translated into the study language. \n\nOver the last few decades, advances in hydrological data capture (e.g. using remote sensing) and data management systems (e.g. GIS) have provided opportunities for overcoming some of the challenges of modelling ungauged catchments. However, the data captured is often from different sensors and sources and at different scales. This research project sought out to creatively use multi-source and multi-scale data to develop a GIS based hydrological model of the River Fani Catchment in the North of Albania to provide, a long term solution for the sustainable management of the Fani Catchment, thus improving the quality of life for the residents of Rubik and the rest of the Catchment. Data from various remote sensing sensors (e.g. Landsat, MODIS, ASTER) and other sources such as published maps, limited gauged flow and rainfall records, local library archives, digital datasets (e.g. CORINE and radar rainfall) and interviews with residents were used to develop the integrated GIS-based hydrological (using WMS hydrological modelling environment) and hydraulic (HEC-RAS)  model of the Fani Catchment. The model was then used to not only map significant environmental change in the Catchment (e.g. deforestation using various vegetation indices), but also to assess flooding impact and to analyse various “What-if” scenarios of conservation strategies (e.g. deforestation, afforestation and provision of runoff attenuation systems). \n\nThe results suggest that the changes in vegetation cover (apart from farming practices) are not considerably extensive in the Catchment between 1984 and 2000. It was observed that afforestation as a flooding mitigation measure did not play a decisive role in runoff reduction compared with attenuation measures. This study has demonstrated the effectiveness of remote sensing and GIS in generating quantitative information on land classification, change detection, soil erosion and general catchment management for remote and ungauged catchments in developing countries. This has been particularly so, owing to recent developments in sensor technologies and increasing available datasets from data providers and the global scientific community at little or no cost.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nicandrou, Aphrodite"],"dc:date":"2011-11-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":64011,"sim:weight":0.440416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64013,"sim:weight":0.43478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60643,"sim:weight":0.410007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61091,"sim:weight":0.375782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26258,"sim:weight":0.33211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52836,"sim:weight":0.317277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.309252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.30838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.30838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61873,"sim:weight":0.300747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.298237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58011,"sim:weight":0.293559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":381570,"sim:weight":0.261548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.257215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60055,"sim:weight":0.256211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85639,"sim:weight":0.254865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64032,"sim:weight":0.251946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56584,"sim:weight":0.233945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.233917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384858,"sim:weight":0.216932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

CGSW has a patient population of 10,878 first referrals over the eight year period, 1998 to 2006.  These data are combined with data on deprivation, GP practices, postcode and administrative boundaries to produce a more complete dataset, enabling analyses to include factors beyond just the service database.\n\nThis is a secondary analysis of a service database, using analyses performed by standard statistical techniques (partial correlation, chi square, Pearson’s r, Spearman’s rho) combined with a Geographical Information System (GIS).  Ethical approval was granted by a multi-centre research ethics committee.\n\nNearly 70% of referrals are for breast, ovarian or breast and ovarian cancer, which helps to explain why more than 90% of all referred patients are female.  Female patients are more likely to be at greater than population risk.  Referrals considered to be high risk patients are more likely to come from secondary care rather than primary care sources and vice versa for those at medium risk.  Patients living in more deprived areas of Wales are less likely to be referred to CGSW than those living in less deprived areas.  This inverse correlation between referrals and deprivation, shows that as deprivation decreases, referrals increase.  One temporal trend that can be identified is an increase in referrals to the CGSW centre in Swansea, from a quarter to a third of all CGSW referrals, and a corresponding decrease to the other two centres in Cardiff and Rhyl.  \n\nThese results have not produced any evidence that referral guidelines influence referrals.  This study has shown the value of quantitative and GIS techniques in the analysis of a cancer genetics database.  They have shown an association between deprivation and referrals, the more deprived an area is, the less referrals will be made from that area.  This has identified cancer genetics as a field that needs to adopt policies aimed at reducing health inequalities and target resources at meeting unmet needs for cancer genetics services.","bibo:AuthorList":["McDonald, Kevin"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This research sought to extend their applicationto time-series of house prices in order to forecast changes in the residential propertymarket at national and regional levels.Neural networks were demonstrated to be successful in producing time-seriesforecasts of changes in the housing market, particularly when combined in simplecommittees of networks. They successfully modelled the direction, timing and scaleof annual changes in house prices, both for an extremely volatile and difficult period(1987 to 1991) and for the period 1999 to 2001. Poor initial forecasting results forthe period 2002 onwards were linked to new conditions in the credit and housingmarkets, including changes in the loan to income ratio.

Systems beyond 3G\nare expected to cater for a wide variety of services such as speech, data, image transmission,\nvideo, as well as multimedia services consisting of a combination of these. With the air interface\nbeing the bottleneck in mobile networks, recent enhancing technologies such as the High Speed\nDownlink Packet Access (HSDPA), incorporate major changes to the radio access segment of\n3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). HSDPA introduces new features\nsuch as fast link adaptation mechanisms, fast packet scheduling, and physical layer retransmissions\nin the base stations, necessitating buffering of data at the air interface which presents a\nbottleneck to end-to-end communication. Hence, in order to provide end-to-end Quality of\nService (QoS) guarantees to multimedia services in wireless networks such as HSDPA, efficient\nbuffer management schemes are required at the air interface.\nThe main objective of this thesis is to propose and evaluate solutions that will address the\nQoS optimization of multimedia traffic at the radio link interface of HSDPA systems. In the\nthesis, a novel queuing system known as the Time-Space Priority (TSP) scheme is proposed for\nmultimedia traffic QoS control. TSP provides customized preferential treatment to the constituent\nflows in the multimedia traffic to suit their diverse QoS requirements. With TSP queuing, the\nreal-time component of the multimedia traffic, being delay sensitive and loss tolerant, is given\ntransmission priority; while the non-real-time component, being loss sensitive and delay tolerant,\nenjoys space priority. Hence, based on the TSP queuing paradigm, new buffer managementalgorithms are designed for joint QoS control of the diverse components in a multimedia session\nof the same HSDPA user. In the thesis, a TSP based buffer management algorithm known as the\nEnhanced Time Space Priority (E-TSP) is proposed for HSDPA. E-TSP incorporates flow\ncontrol mechanisms to mitigate congestion in the air interface buffer of a user with multimedia\nsession comprising real-time and non-real-time flows. Thus, E-TSP is designed to provide\nefficient network and radio resource utilization to improve end-to-end multimedia traffic\nperformance. In order to allow real-time optimization of the QoS control between the real-time\nand non-real-time flows of the HSDPA multimedia session, another TSP based buffer management\nalgorithm known as the Dynamic Time Space Priority (D-TSP) is proposed. D-TSP\nincorporates dynamic priority switching between the real-time and non-real-time flows. D-TSP\nis designed to allow optimum QoS trade-off between the flows whilst still guaranteeing the\nstringent real-time component’s QoS requirements. The thesis presents results of extensive\nperformance studies undertaken via analytical modelling and dynamic network-level HSDPA\nsimulations demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed TSP queuing system and the TSP\nbased buffer management schemes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yerima, Suleiman Y."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The focus must therefore be on developing non-invasive, sub-maximal\ntechniques that allow participants to enter into a steady state of respiration and how\nthis can be assessed.\nTwo techniques were investigated; Respiratory Endurance (as the inspiratory work of\nbreathing) and Tidal Breathing Flow Profile, and these were successfully applied in\n99 adult participants (68 healthy controls and 31 COPD patients) and 75 children (48\nclinical group and 27 healthy controls) who completed 467 respiratory endurance\ntrials whilst seated and exercising, and 249 relaxed tidal breathing trials.\nThe difficulties with lung function assessment are well established and have been\ndescribed in this thesis.

Play is traditionally defined from an adult perspective which focuses on the observable act of play.  However, the research in this thesis draws on children’s perspectives of play which also gives insight into playfulness, the approach or attitude taken to an activity and it is this which is thought to facilitate learning.  It has been shown that children use cues to define an activity as play and three of the studies employed experimental methodology to utilise these cues and create different practice conditions for children to carry out a convergent problem solving task.  Results from these studies showed that children assigned to playful practice conditions exhibited superior performance when solving a task and behaviours conducive to learning compared to children in formal practice conditions.  Furthermore, the cue of adult presence was shown to be critical in facilitating improved performance and learning behaviours although this seemed dependent upon whether individual children used the cue of adult presence in making play and not play distinctions.The final study sought to identify how the cue of adult presence might develop through examining adult-child interactions in the classroom environment. In addition, practitioners were interviewed about their understandings of play and learning to see how this might affect their interactions with children.  Findings from this study showed that practitioners who were confident in their understanding of play and learning were more likely to provide children with choice and control in their activities and engage with children as play partners. Overall, the findings from this research contribute to the literature in this field by providing empirical evidence for the benefits of playful practice and have implications for practice in early years settings.","bibo:AuthorList":["McInnes, Karen Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2011-08-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These agents function autonomously to provide continuous and periodic monitoring of spreadsheet workbooks by content. .NET Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Services technology was used together with the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach for the distribution of the agents over the World Wide Web in order to satisfy the monitoring and classification of the multiple developer aspect. The Prometheus agent oriented design methodology and its accompanying Prometheus Design Tool (PDT) was employed for specifying and designing the agents of MACS, and Visual Studio.NET 2008 for creating the agency using visual C# programming language.\nMACS was evaluated against classification criteria from the literature with the support of using real-time data collected from a target group of excel spreadsheet developers over a network. The Monitoring Agents were configured to execute automatically, without any user intervention as windows service processes in the .NET web server application of the system. These distributed agents listen to and read the contents of excel spreadsheets development activities in terms of file and author properties, function and formulas used, and Visual Basic for Application (VBA) macro code constructs. Data gathered by the Monitoring Agents from various resources over a period of time was collected and filtered by a Database Updater Agent residing in the .NET client application of the system. This agent then transfers and stores the data in Oracle server database via Oracle stored procedures for further processing that leads to the classification of the end user developers.\nOracle data mining classification algorithms: Naive Bayes, Adaptive Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machine were utilized to analyse the results from the data gathering process in order to automate the classification of excel spreadsheet developers. The accuracy of the predictions achieved by the models was compared. The results of the comparison showed that Naive Bayes classifier achieved the best results with accuracy of 0.978.

Another major problem for Riding\u0027s (1991) wholist-analytic style construct is its lack of temporal reliability (Peterson, Deary and Austin, 2003; Rezaei and Katz, 2004; Parkinson, Mullally and Redmond, 2004; Cook, 2008). Furthermore, the current thesis argues that in addition to problems of reliability, the wholist-analytic dimension lacks predictive and construct validity. This thesis outlines two major methodological limitations with the current wholist-analytic ratio measurement, which have raised doubts over the efficacy of the ratio in discriminating between part processing and whole processing style. Firstly, the wholist-analytic ratio is confounded by reflective-impulsive style differences (Kagan, Rosman, Day, Albert and Phillips, 1964). Secondly, the nature of the tasks, combined with strategy preferences, set up an asymmetry in the basis of the wholist-analytic ratio. A new measure of wholist-analytic style, hereafter called the \u0027Wholist-Analytic Style (WAS) Analysis\u0027 has been developed to experimentally manipulate the presentation order of the subtests and the number of parts in the geometric stimuli. Performances on the WAS analysis and the CSA were compared to other styles in the wholist-analytic family to test the unidimensional approach to style. It was found that the wholist-analytic ratio is confounded by sensitivity to reflective style, with much of its discriminatory power being limited to the first subtest, and 6 there is an asymmetry in the part-whole processing basis of the wholist-analytic ratio. Furthermore, there is a consistent relationship between reflective-impulsive style and part-whole processing. This thesis proposes the theory of diminished reflection, which renders the wholist-analytic ratio invalid in its current form. The theory can account for the hereto-unexplained lack of temporal reliability of the wholist-analytic ratio and offers a practical solution to improve both the validity and stability of the ratio. This thesis offers partial support for the unidimensional perspective of style but makes strong links between reflective-impulsive style and part-whole processing preferences.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Joanne"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Due to the development and implementation of new powerful services\nthese systems are becoming increasingly complex.\nImplementing these new services (typically software-based network elements) is often\naccompanied by unexpected and erratic behaviours which can manifest as interoperability\nproblems. The reason for this caused by insufficient testing at the developing\ncompanies. The testing of such products is by nature a costly and time-consuming\nexercise and therefore cut down to what is considered the maximum acceptable level.\nEnsuring the interoperability between network elements is a known challenge. However,\nthere exists no concept of which testing methods should be utilised to achieve an\nacceptable level of quality. The objective of this thesis was to improve the interoperability\nbetween network elements in NGNs by creating a testing scheme comprising of\nthree diverse testing methods: conformance testing, interoperability testing and posthoc\nanalysis.\n\nIn the first project a novel conformance testing methodology for developing sets of conformance\ntest cases for service specifications in NGNs was proposed. This methodology significantly improves the chance of interoperability and provides a considerable enhancement to the currently used interoperability tests. It was evaluated by successfully\napplying it to the Presence Service.\nThe second report proposed a post-hoc methodology which enables the identification\nof the ultimate causes for interoperability problems in a NGN in daily operation. The\nnew methods were implemented in the tool IMPACT (IP-Based Multi Protocol Posthoc\nAnalyzer and Conformance Tester), which stores all exchanged messages between\nnetwork elements in a database. Using SQL queries, the causes for errors can be found\nefficiently.\n\nOverall the presented testing scheme improves significantly the chance that network\nelements interoperate successfully by providing new methods. Beyond that, the quality\nof the software product is raised by mapping these methods to phases in a process model\nand providing well defined steps on which test method is the best suited at a certain\nstage.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bormann, Matthias"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This polarization has become a major issue of problems within the urban spatial planning, particularly in the case of Tripoli and Benghazi. In order to resolve these, the Libyan government had since attempted various efforts to alleviate these urban pressures through both indirect national policies and explicit spatial development strategies. The aim of the study is therefore to produce a critical evaluation of Libyan spatial policies by the government between 1970s and 2006 and to offer insights into how Libya could benefit from a balanced urban system. Both secondary and primary data were explored.\nThis research has identified some merits of a number of spatial policies by the government as well as some major issues and weaknesses of these polices. Although government policies did have some effects in reducing the polarization by the two large cities, the issue of over dominance and the consequent urban problems still largely remained the same.","bibo:AuthorList":["Salhin, Salma Mohammed"],"dc:date":"2011-10-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The\nproblem is to find out how those educational experts could be supported by\ncomputer based tools which are tailored especially to their needs without\nhaving any technical limitations.\nIn this study the separation of technical and educational content in educational\nhypermedia is examined as a solution to this problem. The main\nhypothesis of this study is that the separation of technical and educational\ncontent is possible if it is based on a fine-grained structure of different teaching\nand learning strategies and their conversion into an authoring tool. Such\nan authoring tool would make the creation of educational hypermedia very\neasy for teachers and therefore enable them to overcome the existing obstacles.\nThe development of a new model, the creation of a new XML language\nand the implementation of a new authoring tool form the basis for a detailed\ninvestigation. The investigation was done by undertaking several research\ntasks like the evaluation of the XML language and the authoring tool by a\ngroup of educational experts of different knowledge domains, the practical\nusage of the authoring tool for the creation of real-life based educational\nmaterial and the analysis of the gained research results.\nThe analysis of the qualitative data showed that the separation of educational\nand technical content in educational hypermedia is possible and that\nit can be applied by educational experts with low computing skills as well\nas by technical experts with no educational background.

Study one investigated the relationship between total serum and saliva concentrations of T and C in healthy men (n \u003d 4) under resting conditions. Blood and saliva were sampled simultaneously from 9:00 am until 5:00pm to determine the relationship between total serum and saliva concentration of T and C. Total serum and saliva C showed a strong and significant correlation (r \u003d 0.95, p\u003c0.05). Total serum and saliva T showed a moderate and significant correlation (r \u003d 0.62, p\u003c0.05). Results suggest that under resting conditions, salivary measurements of T and C and T/C ratio can reflect the concentrations of these hormones in blood.\nStudy two investigated the relationship between total serum and saliva concentrations of T and C in response to a treadmill exercise protocol (~ 70% ) in nine healthy men. Blood and saliva were sampled simultaneously pre-exercise, immediately after and at 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min post exercise. Total serum was significantly correlated with saliva C (r \u003d 0.82, p\u003c0.05). No correlation was observed between total serum and saliva concentration of T (r \u003d 0.22, p\u003e0.05). Correction for plasma volume on total serum measurements had little effect on the relationship between both analytes. These results indicate that saliva measurements of C can reflect total serum concentrations under exercise conditions. However, further investigations are required to determine if saliva T measurements reflect the concentration of total serum T in response to exercise. 2maxOV\u0026\nStudy three investigated pre-competition hormonal and psychological states in male elite rugby union players. Hormonal response was measured using salivary T and C. In addition, psychological states were assessed using the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2R). Physiological measures indicated that both T and C were significantly higher before competition (p\u003c0.05) than in resting conditions. Furthermore, significant differences between games were found in cortisol response (F \u003d 6.84, p\u003c0.01) and testosterone response (F \u003d 3.46, p\u003c0.05) suggesting the response of both hormones is affected by venue and/or opposition. Psychological measures indicated that players had higher somatic and cognitive anxiety (p\u003c0.05) before competition than in resting\niii\nconditions. No significant change was reported in anxiety or confidence measures between games. The present results suggest that differences in pre-competition hormonal states may play a key role in subsequent performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morgan, Kevin Andrew"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This\nthesis concentrates on a specific application from Computational Biology. This\nconcerns the construction of new DNA codes which satisfy certain combinatorial\nconstraints, using an alphabet of four symbols. The interest in these codes\narises because it is possible to synthesise short single strands of DNA known as\noligonucleotides. The codes can be useful in the design of these oligonucleotides.\nFor example, the codes are used in DNA computing, as bar codes in molecular\nlibraries and in microarray technologies.\nThe computer algebra system Magma, which deals successfully with coding\ntheory computation, is applied initially to the construction of DNA codes sat-\nisfying a GC-content constraint and a minimum Hamming distance constraint.\nThe constraints are specified to avoid unwanted hybridizations and to ensure\nuniform melting temperatures. Additionally, another constraint, known as a\nreverse-complement constraint, is added to further prevent unwanted hybridiza-\ntions. This additional constraint is studied using involutions in a permutation\ngroup. Codes constructed in this thesis are derived from linear codes over GF(4)\nand Z4 and additive codes over GF(4). Previous approaches to the construction\nof these codes are extended in several ways. Longer codes are constructed, the\nexamination of cyclic and extended cyclic codes is more comprehensive, and\ncosets of codes are considered. In addition, attention is paid to the mapping\nfrom field or ring elements to the DNA nucleotides; different mappings can give\ndifferent lower bounds. Further improvements have been made after the tech-\nniques of shortening and puncturing are applied to the table of best codes, and\nalso by searching for codes in the tables that have an all-ones vector in their dual.\nThe use of a database of best known linear codes is also considered. In many\ncases codes are obtained which are larger than the best codes currently known.\nIn the case of codes of length greater than twenty, linear DNA codes have not\nbeen constructed previously and so all codes obtained are the best known re-\nsults. Generator polynomials are given for the codes constructed. Coset leaders\nare also given in cases where cosets of linear codes are used. Thus it is possible\nfor the reader to construct the codes without repeating the work presented in\nthe thesis. Additionally, files of codewords are available online when the codes\nconstructed are the best known codes and have fewer than 50000 codewords.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aboluion, Niema Ali"],"dc:date":"2012-03-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In MIT\nsystem, the signals detected by the sensors must be measured using a phase sensitive\ntechnique. A sub-millidegree phase stability is typically required for biological tissues,\nwhere the objects to be imaged have relatively low conductivity (\u003c 2S/m). The phase\nnoise and thermal related phase drift in the receiver\u0027s signal chain of currently available\nMIT systems are the major limiting factors of MIT performance for practical\nmeasurements.\nThis thesis describes the development of a high precision DSP based signal\nmeasurement platform. It utilises multi-channel high speed digitisers to sample two or\nmore signals simultaneously and phase differences between the signals are calculated by\nusing FFT based algorithms. The algorithms are optimised for higher speed performance\nusing parallel processing on both multi-core PC and graphic card processors. A faster\napproach based on a dedicated DSP processor for each MIT channel is later suggested to\nreduce data transfer speed limitations between the digitiser and the signal processing\nhardware. By formulating a phase noise estimation model to optimise the digitiser\u0027s\nsetting, it is shown that better phase measurement precision and dynamic range can be\nachieved. To improve the phase drift for practical MIT measurements, a novel\ninstrumentation amplifier was designed and it was incorporated into a new 5-channel\nannular array MIT prototype. The prototype was fully developed into a 14-channel\nCardiff MIT-MKIIa system and both systems demonstrated sub-millidegree phase noise\nperformance with a highly stable phase drift characteristic. To further investigate the\nMIT system for practical applications, phantom measurements were carried out to\ninvestigate the MIT system precision for detecting cerebral stroke and a single channel\nmulti-frequency MIT system was built to perform spectroscopy measurements on\nbiological samples.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hoe, Cher Wee"],"dc:date":"2011-10-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In\nparticular it focuses on problem solving and its prerequisite skills, these are known to be particularly\ntroublesome for novice programmers.\nProgranimate is a unique, web deliverable, simplified development environment that utilises\ndynamic structured flowchart program construction, generated code in several selectable languages\nand animated execution. Progranimate uses a structured flowchart visualisation to convey the key\nconcepts and underlying abstractions of programming, whilst allowing the novice to focus on the\ndevelopment of problem solving skills. Progranimate utilises an easy to use, uncluttered\ndevelopment environment and removes the necessity of writing complex code. This allows the user\nto focus solely on problem solving and on conceptualising the underlying abstractions and\nsemantics of programming. In Progranimate, programs are constructed and executed visually via\ndynamic flowchart and code based representations. The visual synchronisation between the\nflowchart and code representations allow the user to draw an effective correlation between the\nflowchart and the logical code structure that it represents. Program animation features provide the\nuser with an accurate mental model of program execution by emphasising the interaction and\nbehaviour of the key structures and components used in programming. A variable inspection\nfeature is also provided, allowing the user to observe the changes in data as a program is executed.\nCoupled to Progranimate is a scaffolding pedagogy designed to assist novice programmers in the\ndevelopment of problem solving skill. The pedagogy is underpinned by the theories of scaffolding\nsupport and the zone of proximal development. This pedagogy has been utilised within a range of\ncontextual, fun, and gender neutral programming activities designed for use with Progranimate.\nThis thesis hypothesises that using Progranimate on its own or with the scaffolding pedagogy for\nthe creation of simple programs, will help novices strengthen their conceptual understanding of\nprogramming and problem solving skills. Evaluations of Progranimate with secondary schoolpupils, their teachers and first year university students support this hypothesis.

The\neffects of this practice are also being felt in many developed countries due to\nsubstantial migration in recent years.\nOne of the limiting factors in encouraging eradication is the availability of high quality\nevidence of the effects of the practice on the process of childbirth. By highlighting\nthe effects of FGM on the process of childbirth, the objective was to encourage\npolicy makers, in co-operation with many relevant organisations, to work together to\neradicate the procedure.\nThis original study investigates the effects of FGM on the process of childbirth using\na large international epidemiological case control study involving three centres in\nthree different countries. The inclusion criteria were strict and comprised of\nagreement by the woman and or her husband to participate in the study, for a\nnormal singleton pregnancy at term with a cephalic presentation which resulted in a\nnormal baby, for the women with and without FGM during the period of study.\nWomen who did not fulfil these criteria were excluded. Maternal outcome measures\nincluded length of labour, obstruction to the progress of labour, operative delivery,\nurine retention, perineal complications, intrapartum and postpartum haemorrhage\nand blood loss during the process of labour. Newborn outcome measures included\nbirth status at delivery, Apgar scores at 5 and 10 minutes, requirement for\nresuscitation, admission to special care unit and time taken from delivery to the first\nbreast feed. Psychological sequelae were not assessed.\nThe total number of participants in these three centres was 1,970 women; 526 with\nno FGM (control) and 1444 with different types of FGM. Every effort was taken to\nkeep confidentiality and not to interfere with management of labour during data\ncollection.\nThe results indicate a highly significant difference between the two groups when\ncomparing length of the process of labour, mode of delivery and the need for\ninstrumental deliveries, episiotomies and tears, blood loss during and after delivery,\nthe need for catheterisation following deliveries and duration of hospital stay\nfollowing birth.

The data\nprovide clear evidence that the practice of FGM is associated with clinical adverse\neffects, which are not only confined to women but involve the newborn as well.\nIt is hoped that this systematic and comprehensive collection of evidence will make\na substantial contribution to the world wide effort to eradicate this harmful practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khaled, M.

The focus of the research is set on WLMs “understanding and practice of care within their „relational network” of family and friends and against the contextual backdrop of the community in which they live. More specifically, it seeks to ascertain the type and quality of care currently articulated in the private domain against the assumption that changing gender roles may produce a \u0027care deficit\u0027 or caring \u0027gaps\u0027 within the family context of 21st century Britain. With this objective in mind, I have carried out 35 in-depth interviews of WLMs living in the South Wales area between the Rhondda Valley and Cardiff. The research is conceptually placed within the framework of an „ethic of care‟, which, as a moral theory, is only a few decades old and, as such, is still in the process of being formulated. With a relative small number of care ethicists currently publishing in the international and national arena, this thesis seeks to enhance the value and importance of care both as a private and as a public virtue and practice against the cultural and political dominance of an ethic of work. From this particular standpoint, if an ethic of work seems to be increasingly hijacked by consumer capitalism and shaped to respond primarily to “privatised” and  “marketised” self-interest, an ethic of care appears to have been relegated to the private concerns and considerations of women in the domestic sphere of life. Against this backdrop, whilst the understanding of the public/private articulation has remained primarily a matter of theoretical discussion, the important dimension of care has not yet been thoroughly investigated within the empirical framework of these conflicting environments. This thesis intends to offer an empirical investigation of these issues by evaluating the inter-dynamic nature of WLMs “paid work in relationship to their caring commitments. In the process, the embedded tensions of both environments will be exposed and analysed.  I will argue that whilst  “enabling flexible arrangements” at work are conducive to a better management of caring work and promote a better balance between the two domains, “disabling flexible arrangements”are not. Given that the latter have emerged as the most common form of work management, many WLMs do struggle to find the time to care. Yet, under these constraints, WLMs have devised strategies that allow them to carry out their caring responsibilities by ways of maximising their limited resources of time, space and energy whilst minimising their overall investment. This process appears to be so clearly widespread amongst the respondents as to have generated definable patterns. Namely, under apparently normalised and routinised conditions, the cumulative effect of transferring and converting commodified values and practices from the public sphere and the workplace into the world of informal care has been increased and intensified to such an extent as to affect and change the type and quality of care that WLMs are able to experience and practice in relation to their children, to themselves and to some extent, to their \"relational networks\".","bibo:AuthorList":["Corsetti, Claudia A."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.370087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.292869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.292869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Social network sites such as Facebook might be important environments for minority language maintenance, as networks of strong ties may help speakers resist pressures towards language shift. However, to date, there has been little research that investigates this aspect of minority languages\u0027 online presence. This paper presents an initial examination of the current use of the Welsh language on Facebook. The paper introduces a method for sampling the network of groups being used by a language community, based on the Related Groups information within Facebook group profiles. Basic information is presented about the use of Welsh in Facebook groups, including membership numbers, the range of topics, and the levels of activity. Visualizations of the network reveal a small number of popular central groups playing a significant role in connecting the community. The successive removal of central groups results in a relatively sparsely connected network and reveals a number of geographical neighbourhood and topic-specific sub-networks. The use of Welsh on personal profiles is also examined, as are the demographics of Welsh speakers on Facebook. The results of this examination provide evidence that suggests that the use of the Welsh language has been normalized to some extent within Facebook and that the language has established an active presence on Facebook groups and profiles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cunliffe, Daniel J."],"dc:date":"2012-04-20","doi":"10.1080/13691180902914628","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

While online communication might be claimed to enable smaller parties and marginal voices to compete more effectively with major parties, it might also enable minority languages to challenge the existing dominance of majority languages in traditional political communication. This paper explores Welsh-language provision on the websites of the 18 parties which fielded candidates in Wales during the 2010 UK General Election. Three websites making bilingual provision are examined in greater detail, considering the Welsh-language experience in terms of information seeking tasks, the use of web2.0 and resource generation. Overall the provision of regional information relating to Wales and of Welsh-language material has remained remarkably static since the last General Election in 2005. It appears that only parties which regularly contest seats in Wales make regional provision and that Welsh-language provision is limited to those parties who have websites specifically orientated to Wales. The Welsh language does not appear to have been a priority in terms of online political communication for most of the parties campaigning in Wales during the General Election. Even on those sites making a bilingual provision, the quality, timeliness and extent of the Welsh-language experience varied considerably.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cunliffe, Daniel J."],"dc:date":"2012-04-23","doi":"10.3233/IP-2011-0221","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4170539,"sim:weight":0.19287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Design/methodology/approach – Expert inspection was carried out on the web sites of 18 of the 19 parties contesting the election. Goal-directed walkthroughs were conducted on four web sites judged to be making a bilingual provision. Findings – Overall, the Welsh language was highly marginalised. While Welsh-language elements were identified on ten of the 18 web sites, only four web sites attempted to make a bilingual provision. On three of these, a user intending to interact with the web site through the medium of Welsh would still encounter English language content and/or navigation. Only one web site offered a fully Welsh-language experience. Research limitations/implications – This paper only considers the web sites of political parties and presents only a high level analysis.

In archaeology, this has been difficult to achieve at a detailed data level. Repositories of curated excavation datasets are emerging, such as the Archaeology Data Service in the UK, tDAR in the USA, Arachne in Germany but cross search across different organisational data structures remains difficult. Increasingly such digital libraries are including the ‘grey literature’ of excavation reports not formally published. However, these reports are not meaningfully connected with other online data. Significant problems impede achieving the full potential of exposing excavation datasets for wider reuse, even supposing that cross search is technically possible. Problems of semantic interoperability include differing terminology and database schema. Different archaeological teams may use different terms to mean the same thing and the same term may be used for different things. In addition, database structure varies and similar entities may have different names and field structure, making it difficult to search like with like. This paper discusses results from an AHRC funded research project that addressed the issue of semantic interoperability. STAR has demonstrated that semantic interoperability can be achieved by mapping and extracting different datasets and key concepts from OASIS reports to a core CRM-EH ontology via the central RDF based triple store.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tudhope, Douglas S.","Binding, Ceri","Vlachidis, Andreas"],"dc:date":"2012-04-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

When documenting bite marks with standard 2D cameras, errors in photographic technique can occur if best practice is not followed. Subsequent forensic analysis of the mark is problematic when a 3D structure is recorded in a 2D space. A 3D image capture and processing system might avoid the problems resulting from the 2D reduction process, simplifying the guidelines and reducing errors. \nThe proposed solutions in this work are: conducting a review of the current 2D and three 3D capture methods, also a series of benchmarks for system assessment. Followed by a series of performance evaluations of the existing current 2D and two 3D methods. Further proposed solutions include, the design of a system specification for the practical reproducible acquisition of bite mark injuries. Finally a review of the validation process for forensic evidence presented to the courts.\n  The results of the work are as follows: A 3D system is required to produce the correct 3D data of a bite mark and suspect dentition for forensic analysis. Such a system should be practical and consistent, if it is to replace the current de facto 2D systems. The MAVIS hardware can be considered a practical and consistent solution for producing the required 3D image of a bite mark for analysis; however, the MAVIS hardware cannot produce a satisfactory 3D image of a dental cast. At present a laser scanner is required to produce satisfactory results of a dental cast. Angular distortion and errors created by the user in 2D image capture can hinder the digital measurement process. 3D capture therefore introduces less operator error in the form of angular distortion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Evans, Sam"],"dc:date":"2012-05-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These services demand stringent requirements are defined through Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as delay, jitter, loss, etc. To guarantee the delivery of these services QoS routing algorithms that deal with multiple metrics are needed. Unfortunately, QoS routing with multiple metrics is considered an NP-complete problem that cannot be solved by a simple algorithm. This paper proposes three source based QoS routing algorithms that find the optimal path from the service provider to the user that best satisfies the QoS requirements for a particular service. The three algorithms use the same filtering technique to prune all the paths that do not meet the requirements which solves the complexity of NP-complete problem. Next, each of the three algorithms integrates a different Multiple Criteria Decision Making method to select one of the paths that have resulted from the route filtering technique. The three decision making methods used are the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), and Kepner-Tregoe KT. Results show that the algorithms find a path using multiple constraints with a high ability to handle multimedia and real-time applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Begain, Khalid"],"dc:date":"2012-04-26","doi":"10.4018/jitwe.2010100101","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The majority of these devices have a high initial cost, a relatively short period before they become obsolescent and a relatively low second hand value. As a result of this, when the devices are replaced, there are indications that they tend to be discarded. As technology has continued to develop, it has led to an increasing diversity in the number and type of devices that are available, and the processing power and the storage capacity of the digital storage in the device. All organisations, whether in the public or private sector increasingly use hand held devices that contain digital media for the storage of information relating to their business, their employees or their customers. Similarly, individual private users increasingly use hand held devices containing digital media for the storage of information relating to their private lives. The research revealed that a significant number of organisations and private users are ignorant or misinformed about the volume and type of information that is stored on the hand held devices and the media on which it is stored. It is apparent that they have either not considered, or are unaware of, the potential impact of this information becoming available to their competitors or those with criminal intent. This main purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of the volume and type of information that may remain on hand held devices that are offered for sale on the second hand market. A second aim of the research was to determine the level of damage that could, potentially be caused, if the information that remains on the devices fell into the wrong hands. The study examined a number of hand held devices that had been obtained from sources in the UK and Australia that ranged from internet auction sites, to private sales and commercial resellers. The study was carried out by the security research team at the BT IT Futures Centre in conjunction with Edith Cowan University in Australia and the University of Glamorgan in the UK. The basis of the research was to acquire a number of second hand hand held devices from a diverse range of sources and then determine whether they still contained information relating to a previous owner or whether the information had been effectively removed. The devices that were obtained for the research were supplied blind to the researchers through a third party. The ‘blind’ supply of the devices meant that the people undertaking the research were provided with no information about the device and that the source of the devices and any external markings were hidden from them. This process was put in place to ensure that any findings of the research were based solely on the information that could be recovered from the digital storage media that was contained within the device. The underlying methodology that was used in the research was based on the forensic imaging of the devices. A forensic image of a device is a copy of the digital media that has been created in a scientifically sound manner to a standard that is acceptable to the courts. This procedure was implemented to ensure that the evidential integrity of the devices was maintained, with the devices also then being stored in a secure manner.

These drives can contain a vast range of data both of personal value and commercial significance. This paper focuses on two key areas; the potential for the drive operation to be impacted by malicious software and the possibility for the drive firmware to be manipulated to enable a form of steganography. Hard drive firmware is required for the correct operation of the disk drive in particular for dealing with errors arising due to natural wear as the drive ages. Where an area of the drive becomes unreliable due to wear and tear, the disk firmware which monitors the reliability of data access will copy the data from the failing area to a specially designated reserved area. The firmware remaps this data shift so the old data area and the original copy of the data are no longer accessible by the computer operating system. There are now a small number of commercially available devices, intended for data recovery, which can be used to modify the hard drive firmware components. This functionality can be used to conceal code on the disk drive, either as a form of steganography or to potentially include malicious code with the intention to infect or damage software or possibly system hardware. This paper discusses the potential problem generated by firmware being manipulated for malicious purposes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sutherland, Iain","Blyth, Andrew J."],"dc:date":"2012-05-01","doi":"10.1007/s11416-010-0149-x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is motivated by the very notion that the aesthetic potential of photorealistic VR content is, and continues to be, underestimated whilst the emphasis on the development of newer and more efficient visualisation technologies to create new and exciting VR experiences increases. Challenging this, the paper looks beyond the technological (and the more traditional human computer interaction approaches that have primarily focused on the performance and efficiency issues of the technology) in order to explore more human values and the experiential side of VR. It focuses on the design of an “engaged interaction” and in doing so, implements a comparative study to explore how the strategic patterning of the aesthetic elements (particularly colour) within a photorealistic VR environment can allow for the design of a certain experience. In conclusion, the paper demonstrates that aesthetics and the “engaged interaction” can play an important role in getting to the heart of the photorealistic VR “user” experience. It highlights how we might design for (i.e. suggest, coax and guide) an “intended” VR experience.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carroll, Fiona"],"dc:date":"2012-05-01","doi":"10.1080/13614561003710250","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

MOSEL-2 with new constructs has the ability to find the performance and reliability modeling and evaluation of systems with exponential and non-exponential distributions. A MACRO/MICRO cell structure is solved numerically and mathematically in this paper to handle the handoff calls. Additionally, a simulation program is written to validate these results. In order to reduce the loss probability, a guard channels are introduced at the MICRO cell and channel reservation at the MACRO cell. Additionally, the concept of queuing is introduced where there is a possibility for the handoff calls from both MACRO and MICRO layers to be queued when all the resources are occupied. MOSEL-2 is used to find the numerical solution for this problem with both exponential and general exponential (GE) distribution. The performance analysis show the efficiency of the proposed scheme to manage the handoff calls and the ability of the suggested scheme to reduce the blocking probability of handover calls and the loss probability as the main objective is to block the new connection rather than terminating the ongoing connection as well as balancing the load all over the whole network. It is shown in this paper that there are a set of important factors that affect the performance, such as: reservation policy, channel allocation, handover ratio, capacity of the queue and the variation of the inter-arrival times.

HSDPA improves downlink packet data and multimedia services support in WCDMA-based cellular networks. As is the trend in emerging wireless access technologies, HSDPA supports end-user multi-class sessions comprising parallel flows with diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, such as real-time (RT) voice or video streaming concurrent with non real-time (NRT) data service being transmitted to the same user, with differentiated queuing at the radio link interface. Hence, in this paper we present and evaluate novel radio link buffer management schemes for QoS control of multimedia traffic comprising concurrent RT and NRT flows in the same HSDPA end-user session. The new buffer management schemes—Enhanced Time Space Priority (E-TSP) and Dynamic Time Space Priority (D-TSP)—are designed to improve radio link and network resource utilization as well as optimize end-to-end QoS performance of both RT and NRT flows in the end-user session. Both schemes are based on a Time-Space Priority (TSP) queuing system, which provides joint delay and loss differentiation between the flows by queuing (partially) loss tolerant RT flow packets for higher transmission priority but with restricted access to the buffer space, whilst allowing unlimited access to the buffer space for delay-tolerant NRT flow but with queuing for lower transmission priority. Experiments by means of extensive system-level HSDPA simulations demonstrates that with the proposed TSP-based radio link buffer management schemes, significant end-to-end QoS performance gains accrue to end-user traffic with simultaneous RT and NRT flows, in addition to improved resource utilization in the radio access network.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yerima, Suleiman Y.","Al-Begain, Khalid"],"dc:date":"2012-05-02","doi":"10.1007/s11277-010-0027-3","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Measuring the weak signal produced by eddy currents within biological soft tissues can be challenging in the presence of noise and the large signals resulting from the direct excitation–detection coil coupling. To detect haemorrhagic stroke in the brain, for instance, high measurement accuracy is required to enable images with enough contrast to differentiate between normal and haemorrhaged brain tissues. The reconstructed images are often very sensitive to inevitable measurement noise from the environment, system instabilities and patient-related artefacts such as movement and sweating. We propose methods for mitigating signal noise and improving image reconstruction. We evaluated and compared the use of a range wavelet transforms for signal denoising. Adaptive regularization methods including L-curve, generalized cross validation (GCV) and noise estimation were also compared. We evaluated all these described methods with measurements of in vitro tissues resembling a peripheral haemorrhagic cerebral stroke created by placing a bio-membrane package filled with 10 ml blood in a swine brain of 100 ml.

The system aims to detect and classify prostatic tissue textures captured from microscopic samples taken from needle biopsies. Biopsies are usually analyzed by a trained pathologist with different grades of malignancy typically corresponding to different structural patterns as well as apparent textures. In the context of prostate cancer diagnosis, four major groups have to be accurately recognized: stroma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and prostatic carcinoma. Recently, multispectral imagery has been proposed as a new image acquisition modality which unlike conventional RGB-based light microscopy allows the acquisition of a large number of spectral bands within the visible spectrum, resulting in a large feature vector size. Many features in the initial feature set are irrelevant to the classification task and are correlated with each other, resulting in an increase in the computational complexity and a reduction in the recognition rate. In this paper, a Round-Robin (RR) sequential forward selection RR-SFS is used to address these problems. RR is a technique for handling multi-class problems with binary classifiers by training one classifier for each pair of classes. The experimental results demonstrate this finding when compared with classical method based on the multiclass SFS and other ensemble methods such as bagging/boosting with decision tree (C4.5) classifier where it is shown that RR-SFS method achieves the best results with a classification accuracy of 99.9%.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roula, Mohammed.

Next generation satellite systems, operating at high frequency bands offer large bandwidth and are able to provide broadband services. To interface satellite links with existing terrestrial networks for providing communication access to a variety of users directly, several performance issues need to be addressed. Current thesis presents a technically viable satellite-integrated network model that is efficient in carrying broadband services to users over a wide scattered area. \n\nAccurate prediction of attenuation level is necessary for a reliable network model to operate with required service availability. Long term rainfall data has been analysed to characterise attenuation level at a selected region such as Dhaka. It is shown that rainfall is highly seasonal and attenuation level is quite high during monsoon. However, the seasonal behaviour of rainfall can be exploited to improve the link availability. Radar and rain gauge measurements at Sparsholt are also used to find rain cell size distribution, which is an important factor in site diversity implementation to combat severe rain fade. It is found that convective rain cell has extension in the region of 10 km. \n\nThe network model is designed with dimensioning the effective bandwidth to support a number of users over the satellite link by taking into account the multimedia traffic characteristics. Concatenated coding, a robust coding scheme is implemented to improve the link quality at a level required to deliver broadband services. The ITU-T performance objectives of 7.5×10  for CLR and 1.4×10  for CER over satellite links are met at a required Eb/No of 2.95 dB and 2.88 dB respectively. Different enhancement mechanisms for optimum TCP performance are implemented to combat the large propagation delay associated with a satellite link. It is revealed through the simulation that TCP performance over a satellite link is as efficient as terrestrial links with these enhancement mechanisms \nFinally, the overall performance of the designed network is evaluated through link budget analysis and simulation. An innovative downlink power control strategy has been implemented to maintain the link during the rainiest months. The interference level due to high power satellite transmission in the designed system is also calculated to protect other existing communication links sharing the same frequency bands.\n\nA feasible broadband network designed with characterising propagation as well as networking issues will efficiently deliver broadband communication services to a large population promptly and in a cost-effective manner. Such a network solution will be in the realm of current R \u0026 D towards broadband satellite networks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Begum, Sahena"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

More specifically, for eliciting preferences for\npairs of alternative options, two approaches are developed: one is based on Mean Variance\nModel (MVM), which is consistent with Expected Utility Theory (EUT), and the second is\nbased on Analytic Hierarchy Processes (AHP). The main innovation in the first approach is\nin reformulating MVM to be based on cumulative functions using simulation. Two models\nunder this approach are introduced: the first deals with ranking preferences for pairs of lotteries/options with non-negative outcomes only while the second, which is for risk\nmodelling, is a risk-preference model that concerns normalized lotteries representing risk\nfactors each is obtained from a multiplication decomposition of a lottery into its mean\nmultiplied by a risk factor. Both approximation models, which are preference-based using\nthe determined values for expected utility, have the potential to accommodate various\ndistribution functions with different utility functions and capable of handling decision\nproblems especially those encountered in financial economics. The study then reformulates\nthe second approach, AHP; a new algorithm, using simulation, introduces an approximation\nmethod that restricts the level of inherent uncertainty to a certain limit. The research further focuses on proposing an integrated preference-based AHP model\nintroducing a novel approximation stepwise algorithm that combines the two modified\napproaches, namely MVM and AHP; it multiplies the determined value for expected utility,\nwhich results from implementing the modified MVM, by the one obtained from processing\nAHP to obtain an aggregated weight indicator.

In the West, AT was first adopted as a\nconceptual framework for human-computer interaction (HCI) and information systems design\n(ISD) in the late 1980s by researchers associated with the Participatory Design (PD) and\nComputer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) movements. Mainly drawing on\nScandinavian interpretations of AT, this work established a distinctive, predominantly\ncultural-historical approach to context-aware information technology design now known as\nATIT. ATIT is widely recognised as having made significant contributions to the theory and\nvocabulary of HCI and ISD; the principal aim of this thesis is to further develop its usefulness\nfor ICT design. The research discussed explored the theory, history and development of ATIT\nwhile also applying and evaluating various established and new practical ATIT methods.\nThese included the breakdown and focus-shifts analysis approach developed by Bødker and\nher associates and some novel techniques based on systemic-structural activity theory\n(SSAT), a modern, explicitly design-oriented synthesis of the cultural-historical and systemscybernetic\nstrands within Soviet activity theory.\nThe empirical investigation involved participatory action research into the uses of ICT at an\nadult basic education (ABE) Open Learning Centre in south Wales, UK. A longitudinal study\nof an intensive ICT-enabled ABE course, Computer Creative, was carried out between\nSeptember 2000 and May 2001 using ethnographic techniques. This was followed-up by a\nshort video-based study in May 2002. In both cases the aim was to use activity-theoretical techniques to identify ways of improving the use of ICT to support the Centre’s learnercentred,\nempowerment-oriented ABE practice. Using the key ATIT notion of breakdown as a\nstarting-point, a number of factors influencing participants’ effective and creative learning-inuse\nof and with the available technologies were identified. Among the most significant of\nthese was learners’ motivation during the ICT-enabled work-process. Conditions observed to\nencourage positive motivation included physical co-location in a material and sociocultural\nenvironment favouring self-regulation and mutual coordination through communicative and\ninstrumental means and the structuring of ICT-enabled tasks so as to facilitate the formation\nand alignment of personally meaningful task-goals. Although user-interface (UI) design\nemerged as only one among many task-conditions impacting on motivation, some\napplications were persistently associated with recurrent and/or catastrophic breakdown. The\nprincipal UI characteristics identified as likely contributors to such breakdowns were\ninadequate provision of task-relevant information and under- or over-representation of task\ncomplexity. Based on these findings, the thesis presents a number of recommendations and\nguidelines for researchers and designers on the use of activity-theoretical techniques to create\nand evaluate interactive information and communication systems, ICT-enabled workprocesses\nand tasks, and ICT use-settings. In doing so it provides further evidence of the\npotential applicability of AT to a range of IT-design challenges, while concluding that in\norder to more fully realise this potential researchers should consider revising and expanding\nthe conceptual framework of ATIT to include ideas from SSAT.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harris, Steven Robert"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This has resulted in high investments in education and training in the UAE. The government facilitated high technological tools for education. These tools suffered from underutilisation and a failure to be properly integrated in the curricula. The literature review indicates that today‟s knowledge-driven economy demands a workforce equipped with complex skills such as creativity and collaboration. Universities must not only teach the necessary technical skills and knowledge, but also the culture of creativity and teamwork. The learning theories emphasise the importance of learning by doing and collaboration processes to achieve effective learning. Learning theories also emphasise the importance of teaching creative skills to the students. These approaches are congruent with use of technologies, such as visual design studio (VDS), for the purpose of architecture education in design courses, but such use is lacking in the UAE. The present research focuses on implementing and evaluating technologies such as the VDS in architecture education in an attempt to formulate a framework for implementing technologies combined by creative and collaborative skills in the UAE.\nSince implementing a new technology into education practice is complex task, this work will formulate a framework that will help in shifting from the traditional learning to learning with technology. This work will take into consideration factors such as pedagogical issues, collaboration creative work and architecture practice and industrial needs in the UAE.\nThe aim of the current research is to formulate a framework for implementing VDS at the conceptual end of the architecture design education in the UAE.\nThis research will apply an action research method framework. The action research will be generated into three phases. Each phase will consist of three stages, the descriptive stage which will analyse the need and criteria of the method, the constructive stage which will include the process involved in constructing the framework and the evaluative stage which will include the testing and evaluation. The resulting framework should satisfy the UAE‟s needof advanced technological tools for enhancing design education taking in consideration the socio-cultural dimension of the UAE. \n As technology is changing rapidly; future research should concentrate on adding further technological tools such as mobile learning. Also as this work provided a framework for integrating technology in architecture design education, yet it is not limited to this discipline only. Other disciplines could benefit from this emerging model and further research could be conducted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Ali, Amal"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Due to the complexity and the\nprobabilistic nature of the different charging mechanisms often acting simultaneously, it\nis difficult to theoretically predict the charge distribution of aerosol particles or even\nestimate the relative effect of the different mechanisms. Therefore, it is necessary to\nmeasure the size and also the bipolar charge distribution on aerosol particles.\nThe main aim of this research project was to design, implement and simulate a\nsignal processing system for novel, fully functional measurement instrument capable of\nsimultaneously measuring in real time the bipolar charge and size distribution of medical\naerosols. The Particle Size and Charge Analyser (PSCA), investigated in this thesis, uses\nPhase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) technique. The PDA system was used to track the\nmotion of charged particles in the presence of an electric field. By solving the equation of\nparticle motion in a viscous medium combined with the simultaneous measurement of its\nsize and velocity, the magnitude as well as the polarity of the particle charge can be\nobtained. Different signal processing systems in different excitation fields have been designed and implemented. These systems include: velocity estimation system using\nspectral analysis in DC excitation field, velocity estimation system based on Phase Locked\nLoop (PLL) technique working in DC as well as sine-wave excitation fields, velocity\nestimation system based on Quadrature Demodulation (QD) technique under sine-wave\nexcitation method, velocity estimation system using spectral analysis in square-wave\nexcitation field and phase shift estimation based on Hilbert transformation and correlation\ntechnique in both sine-wave and square-wave excitation fields. The performances of these\nsystems were evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations obtained from the\nsynthesized Doppler burst signals generated from the mathematical models implemented\nin MATLAB. The synthesized Doppler Burst Signal (DBS) was subsequently corrupted\nwith the added Gaussian noise. Cross validation of the results was performed using\nhardware signal processing system employing Arbitrary Waveform Generator and also\nNASA simulator to further confirm the validity of the estimation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhang, Lu"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Spatial information systems will benefit from\nhaving data models which allow for data to be viewed and analysed at various levels\nof detail, while the integration of data from different sources will lead to a more\naccurate representation of reality.\nThe work has addressed two specific problems. The first concerns the design of an\nintegrated multi-scale data model suited for use within Geographical Information\nSystems. This has led to the development of two data models, each of which allow for\nthe integration of terrain data and topographic data at multiple levels of detail. The\nmodels are based on a combination of adapted versions of three previous data\nstructures, namely, the constrained Delaunay pyramid, the line generalisation tree and\nthe fixed grid.\nThe second specific problem addressed in this thesis has been the development of an\nintegrated multi-scale 3-D geological data model, for use within a Geoscientific\nInformation System. This has resulted in a data storage scheme which enables the\nintegration of terrain data, geological outcrop data and borehole data at various levels\nof detail.\nThe thesis also presents details of prototype database implementations of each of the\nnew data storage schemes. These implementations have served to demonstrate the\nfeasibility and benefits of an integrated multi-scale approach.\nThe research has also brought to light some areas that will need further research before\nfully functional systems are produced.

The financial\ninformation of Islamic financial institutions issued in their annual reports is\ndifferent in certain features from the annual reports offered by conventional\nfinancial institutions. This study attempts to investigate the usefulness of annual\nreports produced by these institutions to investors. In particular, the study is\nconcerned with the perceptions of both institutional investors and customers in\nKuwait about the annual reports of Islamic financial institutions. In addition, the\nstudy investigates the opinions of the preparers of annual reports of Islamic\nfinancial institutions in GCC countries regarding various aspects of the annual\nreports that could help investors make their investment decisions.\nTo achieve the above objective, two types of questionnaires and interview\nwere designed. The first type of questionnaire was carried out to solicit the\ninvestors\u0027 perceptions of annual reports, the importance they attached to them and\nthe uses of these reports in their investment activities. The second type of\nquestionnaire was specifically used to investigate the opinions of the preparers of\nannual reports regarding various aspects of annual reports that could help\ninvestors make their investment decisions. The interview method was mainly used\nto identify the customers\u0027 perceptions of Islamic financial institutions in Kuwait\nabout the usefulness of these annual reports.\nThe results of the questionnaire and the interviews indicated that the annual\nreports are considered by customers and investors to be the main source of\ninformation for investment decisions. The results also revealed that the timeliness\nand credibility of information were perceived by respondents as the most\nimportant qualitative characteristics that might affect the usefulness of\ninformation sources about the performance of Islamic financial institutions.\nRegarding the accounting regulation of financial information of Islamic financial\ninstitutions, the results indicated that there is a need for accounting information to\nbe regulated in order to enhance the credibility of financial statements produced\nby these institutions and increase their comparability and transparency to the \nusers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Hajji, Abdullah Yousef"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The thesis begins by giving the necessary background to the mixing process and a summary of the fundamental characteristics of parallel architecture machines. This is followed by a literature review which covers accomplished work in mixing flows, numerical methods employed to simulate fluid mechanics problems and also a review of relevant parallel algorithms. Next, an overview is given of the numerical methods that have been reviewed, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods. In the first section of the work the implementation of the primitive variable finite element method to solve a simple two dimensional fluid flow problem is studied. For the same geometry colour band mixing is also investigated. Further investigational work is undertaken into the flows generated by various rotors for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. An extended version of the primitive variable formulation is employed, colour band mixing is also carried out on two of these geometries. The latter work is carried out on a parallel architecture machine. The design specifications of a parallel algorithm for a MIMD system are discussed, with particular emphasis placed on frontal and multifrontal methods. This is followed by an explanation of the implementation of the proposed parallel algorithm, applied to the same fluid flow problems as considered earlier and a discussion of the efficiency of the system is given. Finally, a discussion of the conclusions of the entire accomplished work is presented. A number of suggestions for future work are also given. Three published papers relating to the work carried out on the transputer networks are included in the appendices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Havard, Stephen Paul"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There is a degree of mystery and uncertainty about just what goes on behind the studio door. Some producers are seen as Svengali-like figures manipulating artists into mass consumer product. Producers are sometimes seen as mere technicians whose job is simply to set up a few microphones and press the record button. Close examination of the recording process will show how far this is from a complete picture. Artists are special—they come with an inspiration, and a talent, but also with a variety of complications, and in many ways a recording studio can seem the least likely place for creative expression and for an affective performance to happen. The task of the record producer is to engage with these artists and their songs and turn these potentials into form through the technology of the recording studio. The purpose of the exercise is to disseminate this fixed form to an imagined audience—generally in the hope that this audience will prove to be real. Finding an audience is the role of the record company. A record producer must also engage with the commercial expectations of the interests that underwrite a recording.This dissertation considers three fields of interest in the recording process: the performer and the song; the technology of the recording context; and the commercial ambitions of the record company—and positions the record producer as a nexus at the interface of all three. The author reports his structured recollection of five recordings, with three different artists, that all achieved substantial commercial success. The processes are considered from the author‘s perspective as the record producer, and from inception of the project to completion of the recorded work. What were the processes of engagement? Do the actions reported conform to the template of nexus? This dissertation proposes that in all recordings the function of producer/nexus is present and necessary—it exists in the interaction of the artistry and the technology.ivThe art of record production is to engage with these artists and the songs they bring and turn these potentials into form.","bibo:AuthorList":["Howlett, Michael John Gilmour"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Due to the activities of\noccupational medicine, much progress has been made in transforming the way that operatives\nperform their tasks. However there are still many occupations where manual tasks have become\nmore repetitive, contributing to the development of conditions that affect the upper limbs.\nRepetitive Strain Injury is one classification of those conditions which is related to overuse of\nrepetitive movement. Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome is a subtype of this classification directly\nrelated to the operation of instruments and machinery which involves vibration.\nThese conditions affect a large number of individuals, and are costly in terms of work\nabsence, loss of income and compensation. While such conditions can be difficult to avoid, they can\nbe monitored and controlled, with prevention usually the least expensive solution. In medico-legal\nsituations it may be difficult to determine the location or the degree of injury, and therefore\ndetermining the relevant compensation due is complicated by the absence of objective and\nquantifiable methods.\nThis research is an investigation into the development of an objective, quantitative and\nreproducible diagnostic procedure for work related upper limb disorders. A set of objective\nmechanical provocation tests for the hands have been developed that are associated with vascular\nchallenge. Infrared thermal imaging was used to monitor the temperature changes using a well\ndefined capture protocol. Normal reference values have been measured and a computational tool\nused to facilitate the process and standardise image processing.\nThese objective tests have demonstrated good discrimination between groups of healthy\ncontrols and subjects with work related injuries but not individuals, p\u003c0.05, and are reproducible. A\nmaximum value for thermal symmetry of 0.5±0.3ºC for the whole upper limbs has been established\nfor use as a reference.\nThe tests can be used to monitor occupations at risk, aiming to reduce the impact of these\nconditions, reducing work related injury costs, and providing early detection. In a medico-legal\nsetting this can also provide important objective information in proof of injury and ultimately in\nobjectively establishing whether or not there is a case for compensation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vardasca, Ricardo Angelo Rosa"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Historical documentary analysis explores the development of substance misuse education policy, and documents the issues surrounding attempts to measure the effectiveness of subsequent practice over the last 30 years. The research also evaluates the impact of the ‘Get Sorted’ project in establishing an infrastructure at a local authority level to co-ordinate a range of approaches to the delivery of substance misuse education within Rhondda Cynon Taf. The creation of the ‘Get Sorted’ project was informed by the findings of the documentary analysis and is concerned with reducing the practical limitations faced by educators in order to support them to improve the effectiveness of the education they deliver.\nThe research makes use of three sources of evidence; documentary analysis findings, quantitative data collected to meet the practical monitoring requirements of the ‘Get Sorted’ project, and qualitative research data collected to evaluate the impact of the ‘Get Sorted’ project. The analytical strategy combines the data derived from these three data sets through the application of Stake’s Countenance Theory of Educational Evaluation (1967). \nThe findings of the study demonstrate a conflict between the ‘prevention’ and ‘harm reduction’ approaches to substance misuse education. The assumptions that underpin these paradigms are analysed in conjunction with Burrell and Morgan’s (1979) subjective-objective dimension of assumptions, offering an original contribution to the debate about the efficacy of substance misuse education. The criteria used to define the ‘success’ of education programmes are shown to be unrealistic and not governed by evidence. This study shows that shifting the focus from measuring the effectiveness of individual programmes to the creation of a local authority infrastructure promotes collaboration between providers, improving the effectiveness of the education they deliver. Establishing an infrastructure, the ‘Get Sorted’ project has improved communication between practitioners and policy makers; implemented a consistent approach to the delivery of substance misuse education across a range of education providers and programmes; and ensured practice was informed by research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lancelott, Zoe Victoria"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The online quality of a website has been said to have a positive impact on intention to use a website and perform a search, with preference for a website linked to perceptions of its credibility. Website preferences cam also encourage or discourage consumers’ purchasing intentions and the perceived visual attractiveness of a website is said to have a greater impact on e-loyalty and consumer retention than traditional attributes such as product selection and price. The important impact of preferences necessitates an understanding of the factors in a website that can appeal or not to people. Unfortunately, until as recently as 2004, studies investigating website aesthetics were anchored in the universalist paradigm which assumed that reactions would be universally held rather than differentiated according to demographic variables. A Canadian study in 2005 documented differences in reaction by gender but this study was inadequate in using a single commercial stimulus which had not been selected on any particular basis. Prior to this, research on web aesthetics was rooted in the universalist aesthetic in assuming that a single set of factors would suit all tastes.\nThe overview describes the work by the author to ascertain the extent to which website productions differ by segmentation variables and the extent to which preferences can also be segmented. The author’s work has isolated the impact of segmentation variables (gender, personality and nationality) on website productions and of gender on website preferences and the overview focuses on gender since the impact of this variable has been explored in relation to productions and preferences.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moss, Gloria Ann"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These stress waves are attributed to propagating damage inside the\nmaterial and can be monitored while the structure is in service. This makes AE very suitable\nfor SHM, in particular for aircraft structures.\nIn recent years composite materials such as carbon fibre reinforced epoxy (CFRP) are\nincreasingly being used for primary and secondary structures in aircraft. The anisotropic layup\nof CFRP can lead to different failure mechanisms such as delamination, matrix cracking or\nfibre breakage which affects the remaining life time of the structure to different extents. Accurate damage location is important for SHM systems to avoid further inspections and\nallows for a maintenance scheme which considers the severity of the damage, due to damage\ntype, extent and location.\nThis thesis presents a novel source location method which uses a small triangular AE\nsensor array. The method determines the origin of an AE wave by a combination of time of\narrival and modal analysis. The small footprint of the array allows for a fast and easy\ninstallation in hard-to-reach areas. The possibility to locate damage outside and at a relatively\nfar distance from the array could potentially reduce the overall number of sensors needed to\nmonitor a structure.\nImportant wave characteristics and wave propagation in particular in CFRP were\ninvestigated using AE simulated by an artificial source and actual damage in composite\nspecimens.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aljets, Dirk"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The study sought to move beyond the theories of\nknowledge created by the accepted seminal works on The Learning Organization\nmodel and the largely positivist works on construction contractor performance,\nwhich have focussed on ‘output’ measures only.\nThe literature reviewed indicated minimal understanding of excellent contractor\nperformance from the perspective of the customer within the construction industry\nand even less understanding of the practical application of Learning Organization\nprocesses within the industry. It suggested the need for research to address the\nissue by examining how construction customers viewed excellent contractor\nperformance and what processes excellent performing contractors actually\nemployed.\nThe assumption behind this research is that the organization adapts and responds to\nits environment and takes action to survive and flourish dependent upon its\nunderstating of that environment. This is the same behaviour as a living organism in nature displays, and thus requires the researcher to view the organization as a\nsentient being. Such a view underscores the epistemological perspective, that is the\nassumption of what knowledge is and how it may be discovered, adopted in this\nthesis. The research herein reported therefore follows a post-positivist standpoint.\nThe methodological position for the research sits within a functionalist paradigm, a\nparadigm that enables consideration of the participating organizations within the\nconstruction industry to be viewed as a ‘whole’ and as having interrelated parts. This\nposition was considered to be the most useful for the research.\nThe particular approach chosen was that of multiple case studies carried out on the\nsame subject. Carrying out multiple case studies across different organizations\nprovided case-based themes, which was seen to give the research a greater\ncredibility. By definition, the method was therefore one of a collective case study (Creswell, 2007), where several cases were brought to bear on a single issue. It was\nintended to draw practical examples of Learning Organizations together so that the\ncommonalities and differences between and among them could be integrated in a\nreformulated Learning Organization model for the construction industry.\nDuring the data collection phase, two elements of the research were abandoned as\nunnecessary and impractical respectively. The unnecessary element was the\nquestionnaire element of the contractor case studies, which was abandoned due to\nthe breadth and depth of data gathered through the other elements of the research\n(interviews, focus groups and field observation). The impractical element was the\nintended comparative study on poor performing contractors. This was abandoned as\ncustomers almost without fail noted that poor performing contractors were generally\nnot retained on their programmes and therefore their supply chains tended only to\nrange in performance from adequate to excellent. Secondly, it was realized following\ndiscussions with customers that poor performers were likely to be aware of their\npoor performing status and therefore be unlikely to want to participate in the\nresearch.\nThe customer organizations identified a number of clear areas where they identified\nexcellent contractor performance. The clear position was that the standard output\nperformance indicators of project completion to time, cost, quality, and health and safety were no longer indicators of excellent performance in the industry. These\nindicators were now the minimum performance required to satisfy the customer and\nthere was seen to be a further suite of more behavioural measures which were the\nindicators of excellent performance. These findings were drawn together in a single\nmodel for procurement and performance management.\nThe contracting organizations nominated as excellent performers fell largely into the\n‘medium sized’ bracket of the construction industry. Indeed, some of the\nparticipating customers noted that the larger contractors were actually poorer\nperformers at behavioural aspects of service delivery. The nominated contractors’\nprocesses were examined against the Learning Organization framework provided in\nSenge et al (1990, 1994) to establish the extent to which recognized Learning\nOrganization processes were being employed. It was noted in the conclusions that\nwhilst all of the organizations employed some Learning Organization processes, none\ncould be said to be a model Learning Organization possessing all of the processes\nwhich Senge et al (1990, 1994) suggested. The fact that each organization\npossessed some Learning Organization processes was accepted against the critique of Ortenblad (2007) that Senge et al’s (1990, 1994) model is all-encompassing in\nterms of accepting processes into the Learning Organization model.\nImplications for industry practice were identified based upon the backdrop of\nprocurement and performance management. It was argued that, based on what is\nnoted as really important to construction customer organizations, the procurement\nand performance management functions should be better aligned to identify\nLearning Organization processes and their manifestation as excellent contractor\nperformance from the perspective of the customer. For contractor organizations,\nthere was identified a need to attend to developing Learning Organization processes.\nThere also appeared to be a need for the customer to support the journey of their\ncontractors towards becoming a Learning Organization.\nSenge et al’s (1990, 1994) model was then adapted for the construction industry to\nreflect this need for customer involvement if the contractor was to adopt Learning\nOrganization processes. This adaptation was considered necessary due to the\nconstruction industry model of the customer being more involved in the design and\nconstruction phases of their product, coupled with the fact that a single construction\ncustomer can represent a large volume of their contractors’ turnover (up to 20% is\nnot uncommon). Furthermore, the low contractor profit margins driven by a lowest\nprice tendering culture (often 2-3%) leave little money for internal investment. The support of an informed customer which does not use a lowest price tendering\nprocess was therefore deemed necessary.\nA number of recommendations for further research may be seen to emerge from this\nstudy. Questions were raised as to the reason why larger organizations do not\nappear as able to provide behavioural excellent performance as medium sized\ncontractors which was considered to be an area for further exploration. In addition,\nthe concept of ‘family’ atmosphere (raised several times by participants during the\ncontractor case studies) and its impact upon the ability for the organization to learn\nand provide excellent performance was seen to be worthy of further study. Finally,\nthere was deemed to be the potential to examine the applicability of the extended\nLearning Organization model developed herein to other industries and/or\norganizational cultures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Butcher, David"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77949,"sim:weight":0.362194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75350,"sim:weight":0.349008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.341688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76162,"sim:weight":0.339457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108738,"sim:weight":0.320394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75399,"sim:weight":0.310913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.299519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.284626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.234589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75903,"sim:weight":0.230626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Between these two is the frequently\nignored civic virtue which includes questioning, making suggestions and challenging\norganisational norms. Civic virtue is the least researched, least performed, and the least\npopular organisational behaviour with it often being deemed an act of deviancy. Yet\nimportantly, in terms of the transforming public service agenda, it is also the organisational\nbehaviour that links most closely with organisational improvement.\nIn pursuing this under-researched field, interpretivism provides a salient philosophical\nframework for the operationalisation of the thesis which utilises an in-depth qualitative\napproach to explore the lived realities of public servants, and seeks to advance the limited\nknowledge of civic virtue, set against the backdrop of public service citizenship.\nUsing the lens of symbolic interactionism the thesis contributes an incremental advance in\nresearch method; specifically projective image elicitation, by using the metaphorical power of\ncontextualised cartoon images to explore individuals’ perception of the workplace and their The thesis proposes a contribution to theory in recommending that public service citizenship\npromotes a predilection to bifurcate behaviours demonstrated by others and self into the act\nand underpinning values. Within public services this interpretative process gives precedence\nto the underpinning values; and promotes an environment where disdained behaviours are\npardoned if the underpinning values are deemed honourable. This concept is termed value\ngovernance.\nDrawing on value governance, a model emerged which indicates that public servants\npredominately enact civic virtue when they perceive their values are seriously contested;\notherwise their collectivist tendencies are dominant The discovery of value governance is significant in informing the conception of a dialogic\npublic service citizenship; a citizenship which has its foundation in publicness but which is\nalso able to face the challenges of civicness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Butler, Clare Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In recent computer\nnetworks, the use of different types of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is\nconsidered essential and in most cases mandatory. Major improvements have been\nachieved over the years and a large number of different approaches have been\ndeveloped and applied in the way these systems perform Intrusion Detection.\nThe purpose of the research is to introduce a novel approach that will enable us to\ntake advantage of the vast amounts of information generated by the large number of\ndifferent IDSs, in order to identify suspicious traffic, malicious intentions and\nnetwork attacks in an automated manner. In order to achieve this, the research focuses\nupon a system capable of identifying malicious activity in near real-time, that is\ncapable of identifying attacks while they are progressing. The thesis addresses the\nnear real-time threat assessment by researching into current state of the art solutions.\nBased on the literature review, current Intrusion Detection technologies lean towards event correlation systems using different types of detections techniques. Instead of\nusing linear event signatures or rule sets, the thesis suggests a structured description\nof network attacks based on the abstracted form of the attacker’s activity. For that\nreason, the design focuses upon the description of network attacks using the\ndevelopment of footprints. Despite the level of knowledge, capabilities and resources\nof the attacker, the system compares occurring network events against predefined\nfootprints in order to identify potential malicious activity. Furthermore, based on the\nimplementation of the footprints, the research also focuses upon the design of the\nThreat Assessment Engine (TAE) which is capable of performing detection in near\nreal-time by the use of the above described footprints.  The outcome of the research proves that it is possible to have an automated\nprocess performing threat assessment despite the number of different ongoing attacks\ntaking place simultaneously. The threat assessment process, taking into consideration\nthe system’s architecture, is capable of acting as the human analyst would do when\ninvestigating such network activity. This automation speeds up the time-consuming\nprocess of manually analysing and comparing data logs deriving from heterogeneous sources, as it performs the task in near real-time. Effectively, by performing the this\ntask in near real-time, the proposed system is capable of detecting complicated\nmalicious activity which in other cases, as currently performed, it would be difficult,\nmaybe impossible or results would be generated too late.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fragkos, Grigorios"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Many distinct approaches have been proposed in a significant number of researches\nin order to meet these demands. Optical planar waveguides stand as one of vital employed\napproach in many studies. Although, their low propagation loss, and low dispersion, they\nsuffers from high power losses at sharp bends. For this reason, large radius of curvature is\nrequired in order to achieve high efficiency and compromise the high level of integration. For\nthe purpose of this research, in this thesis different ways to improve the performance of\noptical microcavity ring resonators (MRRs) have been thoroughly investigated and new\nconfigurations have been proposed.\nThe Multiresolution Time Domain (MRTD) technique was further developed and employed throughout this thesis as the main numerical modelling technique. The MRTD algorithm is\nused as a computer code. This code is developed and enhanced using self built Compaq\nVisual Fortran code. Creating the structure and Post-processing the obtained data is carried\nout using self built MATLAB code. The truncating layers used to surround the computational\ndomain were Uniaxial Perfectly Matched Layers (UPML). The accuracy of this approach is\ndemonstrated via the excellent agreement between the results obtained in literature using\nFDTD method and the results of MRTD.\nThis thesis has focused on showing numerical efficiency of MRTD where the mesh size\nallowed or the total number of computed points is about half that used with FDTD.\nFurthermore, the MRR geometry parameters such as coupling gap size, microring radius of curvature, and waveguide width have been thoroughly studied in order to predict and\noptimise the device performance.\nThis thesis also presents the model analysis results of a parallel-cascaded double-microcavity\nring resonator (PDMRR). The analysis is mainly focus on the extraction of the resonant\nmodes where the effect of different parameters of the structure on transmitted and coupled\npower is investigated.\nAlso, accurate analysis of 2D coupled microcavity ring resonator based on slotted\nwaveguides (SMRR) has been thoroughly carried out for the purpose of designing optical\nwaveguide delay lines based on slotted ring resonator (SCROW).\nThe SCROW presented in this thesis are newly designed to function according to the\nvariation of the resonance coupling efficiency of a slotted ring resonators embedded between two parallel waveguides.\nThe slot of the structures is filled with SiO2 and Air that cause the coupling efficiency to vary\nwhich in turn control both the group velocity and delay time of SCROW structures results\nfrom the changing the properties of the bent slotted waveguide modes which strongly\ndepends on the slot’s position.\nSignificant improvements on the quality factor and greater delay time have been achieved by\nintroducing sub-wavelength-low-index slot into conventional waveguide.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abujnah, Nabeil Abduljallil Abubaker"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We try to answer this question by considering several natural logic-based settings that may arise and prove that verification is usually undecidable apart from bounded or otherwise restrictive settings.

Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data from participants (n\u003d16) who were recruited from the non-acute adult medical wards of 14 hospitals in one NHS Trust and a local university. The participants were asked to talk about their experiences of preventing and managing pressure ulcers and their values were elicited from their accounts. The data were analysed and interpreted with Straussian grounded theory.\nNurses were found to work according to the value that they placed on pressure ulcer prevention, as this value influenced the manner in which they prioritised and delivered skin care to their patients. Similar links between nurses’ values and their delivery of care with regards to other aspects of nursing were also identified. The delivery of care to prevent pressure ulcers was found to be subject to clinical priorities and other factors. As a result, the majority of care to maintain skin integrity was delivered by nursing auxiliaries and students because nurses were busy doing other things. Despite this, nurses who place a high value on pressure ulcer prevention appear to be more proactive and determined to deliver care that protects the integrity of their patients’ skin than their peers. This is highlighted by the participants’ accounts of how their prioritisation and delivery of care to prevent pressure ulcers changed when the value that they placed on pressure ulcer prevention increased from low to high. This study also identified the manner in which the value that nurses place on pressure ulcer prevention is formed and evolves. \nThe recommendations that arise from this study are: further testing of this grounded theory in other settings to increase its generalisability and a greater awareness of the impact that the value that nurses place on different aspects of patient care has on their delivery of care to patients, especially with regards to pressure ulcer prevention. Nurse education and training must also take into account some of the factors that help to form and change the value that nurses place on pressure ulcer prevention. Greater attention needs to be paid to the value that nurses place on different aspects of nursing in view of the relationship between nurses’ values and care delivery, if patients are to receive the best possible care.","bibo:AuthorList":["Samuriwo, Raymond K."],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2795330,"sim:weight":0.454033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.308725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It aims to show to what extent DEC reasoning can be applied to Semantic Web data, using the Semantic Web standards and supporting development environments available for the purpose in 2008, when the research programme commenced.The research aims to provide an accurate and reusable DEC ontology using the languages defined in Semantic Web Standards. To this end, an ontology describing the DEC entities and axioms is defined in OWL and SWRL; this represents the core elements of the DEC formalism, namely its set of logical types and predicates and the relations between them. The ontology is used together with a proof-of-concept DEC resolver software that applies the ontology to an existing rules engine, so that new inferences can be created from a DEC domain. The design and implementation of the combined ontology and software framework are described in detail.\nThe methodological issues involved in reconciling a software model with an ontology model are also discussed and the capabilities of the framework are validated by a series of tests modelled on established AI benchmark scenarios that can be resolved correctly using DEC. The results confirm that the framework will create the appropriate inferences with reference to the benchmark problems, though they also highlight some of current limitations in the framework, notably to do with how it represents changing fluent values.A detailed sample domain ontology is provided, which is based on the domain of turn-based multiplayer online games; this illustrates how the DEC ontology defined in this research could be extended for use with other domains. A further extension of the DEC ontology is proposed, which enables the resolver to represent real-world time values independently of the timepoints defined as part of the formalism.Finally, the strengths and extant boundaries of the chosen approach are discussed and suggestions are provided for improvements that could form the basis of future work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mepham, Will"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A review of the international literature identified no universal consensus for a valid method of screening. This thesis describes a multi-method Action Research (AR) programme of study focused on the design, development and evaluation of a reliable and valid dysphagia screening tool (the ‘Head Dysphagia Screen for Stroke’ or HeDSS) for use by Registered General Nurses (RGNs). \nAs a component of the assessment phase of the AR programme, a survey of dysphagia screening practices in England and Wales highlighted widely varied screening practices. Many of these practices were based on limited research evidence, reflecting the lack of consensus for valid dysphagia screening criteria reported in the literature. The design phase of the AR programme involved the development of the HeDSS tool, which centred on the use of research-based screening criteria. Focus group activity determined nurses’ perceptions of the design and subsequent refinement of the HeDSS tool.  The intervention and evaluation phases of the AR programme followed three empirical stages. Stage one established the inter-rater reliability of the Speech and Language Therapist Researcher’s (SLTR’s) clinical dysphagia assessment, which acted as a reference standard against which the validity of the HeDSS tool was to be measured. Clinical judgements for the presence and absence of dysphagia in the same 30 referred patients were compared between the SLTR and a Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) of equivalent experience. Inter-rater reliability was substantial (k \u003d .71). The second empirical stage established inter-rater reliability of the HeDSS measurement outcomes (indicative signs of dysphagia and appropriateness of referral for SLT clinical dysphagia assessment) when employed by two RGNs compared against the SLTR when screening two samples of 20 acute stroke patients. Rater agreement was substantial (k \u003d .71 and k \u003d .79, for detection of signs of dysphagia and k \u003d .79 and k \u003d .87 for appropriateness of referral). The final empirical stage evaluated the concurrent validity of the HeDSS tool measurement outcomes when employed by a second sample of two RGNs compared with the SLTR’s clinical dysphagia assessment outcomes in a sample of 100 acute stroke patients.  The HeDSS tool measurement outcomes correlated highly with the clinical dysphagia assessment outcomes (sensitivity .88 - .96 and specificity .85 - .88 for detection of dysphagia; sensitivity .90 - .96 and specificity .84 - .88 for determining patients appropriate for assessment). Correlation coefficient measures confirmed high concurrent validity for the HeDSS tool (Phi ranged between .76 - .82). \nThis study is the first in the UK to establish a reliable and valid dysphagia screening tool for use with acute stroke patients and has significantly advanced the professional knowledge base within this domain of practice. It is recommended that a multi-centred programme of research be undertaken to replicate this study with a larger nurse and patient sample.","bibo:AuthorList":["Head, Kathryn"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Due to its fairness, flexibility, service differentiation and\nincreased inherent security, CDMA is proved to be more suitable for the bursty\nnature of local area networks than synchronous multiplexing techniques like\nFrequency/Wavelength Division Multiplexing (F/WDM) and Time Division\nMultiplexing (TDM). In optical domain, CDMA techniques are commonly known\nas Optical-CDMA (O-CDMA). All optical CDMA systems are plagued with the\nproblem of multiple-access interference (MAI). Spectral amplitude coding (SAC)\nis one of the techniques used in the literature to deal with the problem of MAI.\nThe choice of spreading code in any CDMA system is another way to ensure the\nsuccessful recovery of data at the receiving end by minimizing the effect of MAI\nand it also dictates the hardware design of the encoder and decoder.\nThis thesis focuses on the efficient design of encoding and decoding hardware.\nPerfect difference codes (PDC) are chosen as spreading sequences due to their\ngood correlation properties. In most of the literature, evaluation of error\nprobability is based on the assumptions of ideal conditions. Such assumptions\nignore major physical impairments such as power splitting losses at the\nmultiplexers of transmitters and receivers, and gain losses at the receivers, which\nmay in practice be an overestimate or underestimate of the actual probability of\nerror.\nThis thesis aims to investigate thoroughly with the consideration of practical\nimpairments the applications of PDCs and other spreading sequences in optical\ncommunications systems based on spectral-amplitude coding and utilizing codedivision\nas multiplexing/multiple-access technique. This work begins with a\nxix\ngeneral review of optical CDMA systems. An open-ended practical approach has\nbeen used to evaluate the actual error probabilities of OCDM/A systems under\nstudy. It has been concluded from results that mismatches in the gains of\nphotodetectors, namely avalanche photodiode (APDs), used at the receiver side\nand uniformity loss in the optical splitters results in the inaccurate calculation of\nthreshold level used to detect the data and can seriously degrade the system bit\nerror rate (BER) performance. This variation in the threshold level can be\ncompensated by employing techniques which maintain a constant interference\nlevel so that the decoding architecture does not have to estimate MAI every time\nto make a data bit decision or by the use of balanced sequences.\nIn this thesis, as a solution to the above problem, a novel encoding and decoding\narchitecture is presented for perfect difference codes based on common zero code\ntechnique which maintains a constant interference level at all instants in CDM\nsystem and thus relieves the need of estimating interference. The proposed\narchitecture only uses single multiplexer at the transmitters for all users in the\nsystem and a simple correlation based receiver for each user. The proposed\nconfiguration not only preserves the ability of MAI in Spectral-Amplitude Coding\nSAC-OCDM system, but also results in a low cost system with reduced\ncomplexity.

This dissertation will show that the women’s groups that played such a crucial supportive role in it were not the homogenous entity that has often been portrayed. They shared some comparable features with similar groups in English pit villages but there were also qualitative differences between the South Wales groups and their English counterparts and between the different Welsh groups themselves. There is evidence of tensions between the Welsh groups and disputes with the communities they were trying to assist, as well as clashes with local miners’ lodges and the South Wales NUM. At the same time women’s support groups, various in structure and purpose but united in the aim of supporting the miners, challenged and shifted the balance of established gender roles\nThe miners’ strike evokes warm memories of communities bonding together to fight for their survival. This thesis investigates in detail the women involved in support groups to discover what impact their involvement made on their lives afterwards. Their role is contextualised by the long-standing tradition of Welsh women’s involvement in popular politics and industrial disputes; however, not all women discovered a new confidence arising from their involvement. But others did and for them this self-belief survived the strike and, in some cases, permanently altered their own lives. The activities of the women’s support groups confirmed changes in the social role of women that had been occurring since the 1960s in the coalfield communities of South Wales, and thereby contributed to a revision of the traditional notion of ‘communities’ which were changed by the very process of being defended.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Rebecca"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":6117430,"ep:Repository":46,"dc:type":["Thesis","doctoral","PhD"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Effect of acute and chronic exercise on immunoendocrine responses in professional rugby union","bibo:abstract":"Prolonged and intense exercise is known to modulate and suppress certain aspects of the immunoendocrine system. Such effects are thought to be largely mediated by the release of stress hormones and regulatory cytokines which originate from a variety of stress related paradigms in sport. These include acute physical exertion, chronic and repetitive exercise as well as other psychological and psychosocial aspects of training and competing in an elite environment. It may be of particular interest to study the effects of regular competition and training on immunoendocrine markers in rugby union players. At the professional level, rugby is an intense and physically demanding game where a significant amount of tissue trauma occurs as a result of the many game collisions. The aims of the studies outlined in this thesis were to determine the effects of acute, repeated and chronic exercise exposure on immunoendocrine markers and illness incidence in professional rugby union. Additional case studies were also undertaken to supplement main study findings. \n\nThe first part of the thesis documented the effects of acute and repeated exercise on immunoendocrine markers in a cohort of international rugby union players. Data in study 1 showed that large disturbances in immunoendocine and hormone levels occur in players (n \u003d 10) following game play. The magnitude of this response appeared dependent on game physicality (number of rucks/mauls, tackles) and the number of collisions players received during match play. Findings also showed suppression in host immunity, and in particular, innate immune function (neutrophil degranulation) which was not resolved 38 h (-29%) into the recovery period. In study 2, bloods were taken from players (n \u003d 8) across a 21-day international rugby series. Data revealed that players entered the international camp with residual muscle damage (creatine kinase; CK) and inflammation (hs-CRP) following previous club involvement in European cup rugby. Further increases in stress related markers (cortisol, IL-6, CK, CRP) were not evident throughout the players time at the international training base. Conversely, a progressive increase in anabolic-catabolic balance (T/C ratio) was observed across time. In comparison to values on camp-entry (day 1), increases in T/C ratio were evident on day-5 (9.8%), day-7 (13%), day-19 (35%) and day-21 (45%) (P \u003c 0.05). This data is suggestive of improved physiological recovery and was commensurate with team fitness goals (reduced volume + maintenance of training intensity) for that time. Findings suggest that monitoring of player club activities and training load preceding international duty is pertinent if they are required to represent their country inside 7 days. \n\nThe second part of the thesis evaluated the stress induced effects of chronic rugby exposure in professional club players. Questionnaire data analysed from study 3 showed that players (n \u003d 65) perceived current season length as being ‘too long’ (55%), ‘poorly structured’ (56%) and that game demands are increasing with time (52%). Furthermore, the majority of players (80%) felt that time ‘away’ from rugby was not sufficiently long enough and were in favour of a mid-season break (2 wks in duration).  \n\nInvestigation into the effects of chronic exercise on illness incidence, immunological and psychological state was carried out in a squad of club players (n \u003d 30) over a competitive season (n \u003d 48 wks) in studies 4-6. Findings revealed that specific periods in a rugby season resulted in disturbances to hormonal and immune status. These periods occurred following breaks in club game fixtures [November international and Six-nations period: February/early March], times of increased training intensity and increased ratio of conditioning/rugby activity. Peaks in number of upper respiratory illnesses (URIs) and disturbances in psychometric variables also occurred during these time periods. In 23% of all URIs, players reported that the presence of the illness either reduced activity (14.4%) or felt the need to go to bed (8.6%). Positional differences in variables were also observed. A higher incidence of URIs (3.4 vs 4.3) and lower concentrations of resting immune markers [salivary lysozyme: s-Lys (-31%); immunoglobulin A: s-IgA (-27%)] was observed in ‘backs’ (vs forwards) over the season. Higher mid-season cortisol levels was also observed in backs (P \u003c 0.05) while conversely, greater concentrations of plasma CK and CRP were found in forwards throughout the season. These findings indicate positional specific differences in response to exercise load and point to the role of group specific recovery at certain times during the season. Data from study 6 showed that the number of training related complaints decreased across the season, findings which closely resembled corresponding decreases in plasma CRP values. This data is suggestive of a ‘repeated-bout’ effect or ‘contact adaptation’ in rugby union.\n\nFinally, comparison of methods used in the recording of illness data revealed that players were more honest when disclosing the existence of banal infections to a web-based training diary and under-reported infections to medical staff.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cunniffe, Brian"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There were three studies in all; the classical analogy tasks monitored sixty-four, 3, 4 and 5-year-olds’ performance on two separate occasions, six months apart; study 2 monitored thirty-four, 3 and 4-year-olds’ strategy use on problem analogies, at week one and week 30; and the microgenetic study followed thirty, 4 and 5-year-olds strategy use over a 30 week period, at weekly intervals. \n\nThe results revealed that children relied on a number of strategies and their choices varied over the 30 week period. The microgenetic methodology provided us with a chance to monitor intra- and inter-individual changes. The problem analogies raised awareness of a number of performance factors that affect children’s strategy choices. These included relational knowledge, relational difficulty, practice and transfer. Children’s ability to use analogy improved over time with practice, and some children showed consistency in their use of analogy over certain tasks, but often regressed to less effective strategies on subsequent tasks\n\nThe use of individual case studies provided an in depth account of children’s patterns of behaviour over the observation period. This allowed us to explore children’s rate of change, path and breadth in strategy choices and what affected these changes. The case studies provided strong evidence for a gradual wave-like change in children’s analogical development. The theoretical and educational implications of this were discussed. It can be concluded that preschool children continue to find analogy difficult and the findings of strategic variability highlights the fact that 4- and 5-year-olds are in a period of transition in the development of analogical reasoning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greenway, Charlotte W."],"dc:date":"2012-05-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Drawing on the recent academic literature on policy agenda-setting, risk communication and trust communication, my research explored Research Questions on risk communication and risk perception linking policy agenda-setting that would be of great benefit for the Nigerian policy-makers, and indeed oil companies to understand. The researcher addressed these Research Questions through a survey [1,200 questionnaires] of Nigerians and interviews [10] with key people in Nigeria. These Research Questions are very timely and penetrating, in what has been, to date, a very under-researched area – namely, investigating the flows and impacts of trust-risk communication in agenda setting in a less-developed country. The researcher used three states in Nigeria’s Niger Delta region namely, Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers for the purpose of this research because conflict and risk issues is most pronounced in the aforementioned states due to oil exploration / exploitation and underdevelopment. Findings from this research revealed that the Nigerian media-policy-public agendas face specific problems in influencing one another on environmental risk issues and other facet of the conflict in Nigeria’s Niger Delta region. These specific problems which reflect gaps in knowledge in the Niger Delta conflict have now been outlined, so needing further attention and work by stakeholders in the public policy field with regards to the Niger Delta conflict. To this end, areas in need of research focus were outlined and several recommendations were made by the researcher which if adopted by the Nigerian government / policy makers, the media, oil companies and other stakeholders will help douse Nigeria’s Niger Delta conflict.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edafienene, Aghogho Kingsley"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Referral via an appropriate pathway to a specialist service is vital to the early detection of colorectal cancer but there is neither a standard referral system nor a nationally agreed referral pathway in the UK. Though studies have compared individual components of different models of health care in colorectal cancer, this is the first study comparing two models in their entirety.\nHypothesis\nThe distinct model of service delivery in Trust A picks up a higher percentage of early colorectal cancers than the model of service delivery in Trust B.\nMethod\nThe study compares colorectal cancers diagnosed from two adjacent Trusts in Wales during a three year period. The samples obtained after rigid exclusions correlate the two models of health care with the stage of cancer at diagnosis.\nResults\nTrust A has a higher emergency and urgent workload. The overall pick up of early cancers is similar in both Trusts. However, there is a higher pick up rate of early colorectal cancer in Trust A, when GPs accessed the specialist service using an urgent referral through the elective route. Trust A had lower overall waiting times for the first clinic appointment but there was no difference for urgent cases between the two Trusts. Specialists in Trust B had a higher rate of re-prioritisation of urgent GP referrals to the non urgent category.\nConclusion\nThere appears to be no significant difference in the overall pick-up rate of modified Dukes’ A colorectal cancers between the two models of health care delivery. The higher pick up rate of early colorectal cancer in Trust A was achieved only where GPs sent patients into the specialist service using an urgent referral through the elective route.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shah, Parin Rajendra"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, there is a suggestion that ageing in people with learning disabilities starts earlier, that they are at greater risk of developing physical and mental disorders and diseases, requiring the intervention and support of nurses. Educators and service planners will require information on the present and future needs of older people with learning disabilities in order to equip these professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills to address those needs. \n\nThis study sought to explore what older people with learning disabilities and their carers perceived as their health care needs. It also sought to explore what nurses perceived as their role in meeting such needs and the implications for nurse education, research and practice. A three-stage approach was used which comprised of a detailed literature review in stage one. \nStage two involved the development of six case studies around six older people with learning disabilities utilising semi-structured interviews and gathering data from a variety of other sources which were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Reflexivity formed a key component of this approach in both stage two and three as it allowed the researcher to lay bare potential biases and influences in the interpretation of the gathered data. It also enabled the researcher to focus on the subtle changes that led to a sense of emancipation. Stage three comprised of two focus groups with nurses specialising in the care of people with a learning disability and also with nurses who might be involved in supporting older people with a learning disability and their families but who did not specialise solely in this area of work. \n\nAll six case studies highlighted that older people with learning disabilities had for the majority of their life had contact with nurses. Common themes to emerge were the use of medication, physical health problems and lack of friendships. Carers were concerned for the future of the person they cared for and the impact of PEG feeding on the individual’s Quality of life. The clients understanding and feelings towards getting older seemed unclear and in some instances professionals lacked knowledge of the client and learning disability. All nurses participating in the focus groups had come into contact with older people with learning disabilities except 2 nurses in the area of mental health. Common themes to emerge were again physical and mental health needs, health checks, PEG feeding and some institutional care issues. Dementia care seemed a major concern as well as the difficulties of supporting older people in their place of residence. \n\nThere was no clear role for nurses with regards to older people with learning disabilities although nurses seemed to have been involved in their care across the lifespan. Most nursing groups would welcome additional training with regards to the needs of older people with learning disabilities. There appeared to be very little ‘hands on’ health promotion activities undertaken by nurses related to this client group. Spiritual and palliative care needs seemed to be largely ignored. Community learning disability nurses had difficulties in finding appropriate services and accommodation for older people with learning disabilities. Future roles for nurses were identified particularly for learning disability nurses in meeting the needs of older people with learning disabilities. Recommendations were also made regarding the implications for research, practice and education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jenkins, Robert Ivor"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, current literature shows less consideration on the potential disciplinary gap in the blended learning experience, as a result there is a paucity of evidence from cross-country/institutional/disciplinary investigations. This study aimed to explore, analyse and compare the blended learning experience in higher education. The research is reflected in 3 questions: (1) What are the current blended learning experiences in the selected higher educational institutions? (2) How such experience varies in different disciplines? (3) What are the reflections on the comparative experiences in (1) and (2)? The qualitative case study with comparative methods was used to obtain in-depth findings for these research questions. I visited 4 universities in two countries and sampled 51 research participants’ voices from contrasting disciplines. With these voices, I thoroughly discussed individual case studies, followed by a cross-case and cross-discipline comparison. These findings enabled insights to be drawn on a major argument: blended learning did enable and enhance learning experiences in all case studies but disciplinary differences remain a major challenge. The analysis shows that academics from science-based disciplines have an advantage at the instrumental level of technological usage without transforming learning experience; social science-based academics, due to their disciplinary nature, have embedded technology in wider trans-technical aspects that would enhance and transform learning and teaching. In the context of blended learning, I would argue that learning has not been enhanced (1) if the technology is the sole focus; (2) if the research effort of “technology enhanced learning” does not gain ground in educational theories and (3) does not recognise the disciplinary differences. Arising out of these findings, I proposed a blended learning model that indicates the boundary of the current literature and research findings, and a blended learning definition - an educational-focused process to enhance and transform f2f learning with the blend of technology in a symbiotic relationship. It is necessary for educationists and technologists to establish such a symbiotic relationship and the inter-disciplinary integration and discourse, that may impact on the individuals’ practice beyond their own disciplinary territory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chew, Esyin"],"dc:date":"2012-05-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

PhCs, otherwise\nknown as Photonic Bandgap (PBG) material, have one or more frequency bands in\nwhich no electromagnetic wave is allowed to propagate inside the PhC. Creating\ndefects into such a periodic structure makes it possible to manipulate the flow of\nselected light waves within the PhC devices outperforming conventional optical\ndevices. As the fabrication of PhC devices needs a high degree of precision, we have\nto rely on accurate numerical modelling to characterise these devices.\nThere are several numerical modelling techniques proposed in literature for\nthe purpose of simulating optical devices. Such techniques include the Finite\nDifference Time Domain (FDTD), the Finite Volume Time Domain (FVTD), and the\nMulti-Resolution Time Domain (MRTD), and the Finite Element (FE) method\namong many others. Such numerical techniques vary in their advantages,\ndisadvantages, and trade-offs. Generally, with lower complexity comes lower\naccuracy, while higher accuracy demands more complexity and resources.\nThe Complex Envelope Alternating Direction Implicit Finite Difference Time\nDomain (CE-ADI-FDTD) method was further developed and used throughout this\nthesis as the main numerical modelling technique. The truncating layers used to\nsurround the computational domain were Uniaxial Perfectly Matched Layers\n(UPML).

The holes of the structures are\nfilled with polyaniline electrorheological fluids that cause the refractive index of the\nholes to vary with applied external electric field.

Areas that contain a higher than expected incidence of the phenomena, given background population and census datasets, are of particular interest. By analysing the locations of potential influence, it may be possible to establish where a cause and effect relationship is present in the observed process.\nCluster detection techniques can be applied to such datasets in order to reveal information relating to the spatial distribution of the cases. Research in these areas has mainly concentrated on either computational or statistical aspects of cluster detection. Each clustering algorithm has its own strengths and weakness. Their main weaknesses causing their unreliability can be estimating the number of clusters, testing the number of components, selecting initial seeds (centroids), running time and memory requirements. Consequently, a new cluster detection methodology has been developed in this thesis based on knowledge drawn from both statistical and computing domains. This methodology is based on a hybrid of statistical methods using properties of probability rather than distance to associate data with clusters. No previous knowledge of the dataset is required and the number of clusters is not predetermined. It performs efficiently in terms of memory requirements, running time and cluster quality. The algorithm for determining both the centre of clusters and the existence of the clusters themselves was applied and tested on simulated and real datasets. The results which were obtained from identification of hotspots were compared with results of other available algorithms such as CLAP (Cluster Location Analysis Procedure), Satscan and GAM (Geographical Analysis Machine). The outputs are very similar.\nXVI\nGIS presented in this thesis encompasses the SCS algorithm, statistics and neural networks for developing a hybrid predictive crime model, mapping, visualizing crime data and the corresponding population in the study region, visualizing the location of obtained clusters and burglary incidence concentration ‘hotspots’ which was specified by clustering algorithm SCS. Naturally the quality of results is subject to the accuracy of the used data. GIS is used in this thesis for developing a methodology for modelling data containing multiple functions. The census data used throughout this construction provided a useful source of geo-demographic information. The obtained datasets were used for predictive crime modelling.\nThis thesis has benefited from several existing methodologies to develop a hybrid modelling approach. The methodology was applied to real data on burglary incidence distribution in the study region. Relevant principles of statistics, Geographical Information System, Neural Networks and SCS algorithm were utilized for the analysis of observed data. Regression analysis was used for building a predictive crime model and combined with Neural Networks with the aim of developing a new hierarchical neural Network approaches to generate a more reliable prediction. The promising results were compared with the non-hierarchical neural Network back-propagation network and multiple regression analysis. The average percentage accuracy achieved by the new methodology at testing stage increase 13% compared with the non-hierarchical BP performance. In general the analysis reveals a number of predictors that increase the risk of burglary in the study region. Specifically living in a household in which there is ‘one person’, ‘lone parent’, household where occupations are in elementary or intermediate and unemployed. For the influence of Household space, the results indicate that the risk of burglary rate increases within the household living in shared houses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Majeed, Salar Mustafa"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The Technium network is considered to be at the hard/tangible end of the policy continuum whilst Communities First is at the softer, more intangible pole of the continuum.\nThe aim of this thesis is to ascertain the influence social capital may have upon levels of innovation across the innovation policy continuum. To achieve the aim, the existence and extent of forms of innovation, forms of social capital, and cooperation and collaboration are considered through a positivist and interpretivist analysis. The resultant data has been further exposed to a correlation analysis, undertaken to ascertain whether or not the presence and form of social capital has an association with forms of innovation.\nThe three programmes each have a pan-Wales presence. The programmes all originate from Welsh Assembly Government innovation policy initiatives between 2001 and 2003. For each programme a case study has been produced. The case studies have been constructed using data from survey, interviews and participant observation. The survey was completed via an on-line questionnaire by representative individuals and groups from each innovation policy continuum programme. Further data was collected by interviews held with individuals representative of roles typically undertaken at each programme. Participant observation undertaken at each programme also informed the creation of the case studies.\nLiterature in this field of study is typically limited to a comparatively narrow investigation of traditionally measured innovation. For social capital and cooperation and collaboration, research usually has a macro scale cynosure. This study has an innovation programme locale in Wales which may be considered unique in terms of innovation and social capital research.\nii\nThe findings reveal the existence of forms of innovation, social capital, and cooperation and collaboration at each case study. However, there are differences in terms of the extent of such phenomenon along the innovation policy continuum. For instance, there appears to be an increased likelihood of traditionally measured innovation at the Technium network. Social innovation is more likely to be present at the Communities First project. Similarly, forms of social capital are more likely to be found at Communities First partnerships than at other programmes along the continuum. The correlation analysis applied to the case study survey data discloses a number of, mainly positive statistically significant associations between explanatory social capital, and cooperation and collaboration variables and dependent innovation variables.\nPropositions resultant of the findings, are likely to be of use to policymakers. For instance, forms of social capital appear to be positively related to traditionally measured, hidden and social innovation. Policymakers considering the design of programmes to boost levels of innovation may be advised to include means of increasing levels of social capital, cooperation and collaboration in their policy and programme proposals and evaluation criteria.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murphy, Lyndon John"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This included the history and context of the writing and the way in\nwhich the three topics hold together and the patterns or relationships that can be seen\nbetween them. Most of the articles aim to bring something new to the public arena and\nchallenge the current status quo in Higher Education. The Learning and Teaching\narticles show active ways of developing learning and seeing things in a new light rather\nthan absorbing knowledge, constructing or working from educational theory. In particular\na curriculum is defined for all stakeholders. There is no necessity for teaching and\nlearning to be the same as research but on occasion it helps for it to be “research like”.\nResearch articles are on collaborative qualitative research and detailed reviews of\nscientific research in my discipline. In my educational research articles I stand up to the\ndominance of subject-based research. Development articles articulate the practice and facilitation of individual and group reflection methods. They also further the networking,\npan-organisation, pro-person approach of academic developers. The analysis produces\na dynamic model for Higher Education scholarship that opens up space for academic\ndevelopment and the neglected area of professional and personal development. In\nparticular, some articles articulate and demonstrate the role of academic developers in\nevaluating research. There is no evidence for the need of a single nexus to fulfil a\nmagical link specifically between learning and teaching and research because links\nalready exist within academic and professional development and through existing border\nsubjects of curriculum, reflection, professional ethics and evaluation.\nI am grateful for the guidance I have received to create this analysis of my written work.\nFrom this it is possible to position myself academically as a developer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sweet, John"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study aims to address this gap by identifying tangible and intangible benefits and disbenefits of CGSs and presenting these within a framework to assist in the design of a comprehensive welfarist economic evaluation.\nMixed methods of data collection were adopted and a UK medical genetics service was used as a case study. Face-to-face interviews with genetic service providers were undertaken in Phase One to explore patient pathways and the perceived role of the service. Focus groups and face-to-face interviews with service users explored the perceived benefits and disbenefits of the CGS in Phase Two. Phase Three comprised a pilot study of using Audience Response Systems (ARSs) for exploring stakeholder preferences and tackled issues of respondent validation and transferability.\nBoth process-related attributes and psychosocial outcomes emerged as utility-bearing for service users. Patient pathways i.e. patient experience, were found to be influenced by factors associated with the genetic condition and with individual patient/family characteristics and needs. The overall (dis)benefits of the service however were found to be common across conditions. The concept of Perceived Familial Control is proposed as a suitable outcome which encompasses the psychosocial dimension of CGSs.\nThis study has demonstrated the use of qualitative methods in the context of health economics and economic evaluation. It has specifically demonstrated the use of various levels of qualitative analysis for obtaining attributes and outcomes of CGSs and has incorporated these within a framework directed towards the design of a welfarist economic evaluation. The use of ARSs was also tested for their usefulness as a method of establishing preferences and exploring the opinions of CGS stakeholders.\nFurther research is required to establish whether the emerging (dis)benefits represent the experiences of users of other UK clinical genetic centres. Subsequently, user preferences for the identified (dis)benefits could be explored as a step towards the design of a welfarist economic evaluation. Further research is also required to develop the concept of Perceived Familial Control into an appropriate outcome measure for CGSs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pithara, Christalla"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Gasification is currently one of\nthe most promising thermal-chemical conversion techniques for recovering energy\nfrom waste, and the pyrolytic behaviour of secondary refuse fuel (SRF) briquettes and\nbiomass-derived fuels is the starting point for the process. The purpose of this study\nwas to evaluate the pyrolytic characteristics of SRF briquettes and biomass materials,\nsuggest a kinetic model for simulating the pyrolytic process and obtaining the kinetic\nparameters, and then predict the yield of volatile products in pyrolysis.\nKnowledge of the chemical composition, the thermal behaviour and the reactivity of\nSRF briquettes and their blends with other materials, such as biomass and plastic\nduring pyrolysis is very important for the effective design operation of gasification\nunits. The kinetics of the pyrolysis of simulated SRF briquettes, SRF briquettes and\npulverised biomass samples was successfully modelled by a scheme consisting of two\nindependent general order parallel reactions of the main components which were hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and plastic. The kinetic parameters estimated through\nthe model were comparable with those reported in the literature. In this research,\nactivation energy values varied between 30 – 70 kJ/mol for lignin pyrolysis, 96 – 137\nkJ/mol for hemicellulose and cellulose pyrolysis, and about 260 kJ/mol for plastic\npyrolysis.\nBiomass has a very high volatile content. Adding biomass into SRF briquettes could\nincrease the volatile yield. Increasing the plastic content of SRF briquettes could\nincrease the volatile yield, the derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) peak height and\nthe repeatability of pyrolysis. Inorganic component could shift the cellulose pyrolysis\nto a lower temperature and cause the hemicellulose pyrolysis and the cellulose\npyrolysis highly overlapped, but it could have a positive effect by acting as catalysts\nand lower the activation energy in the pyrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose.\nMolasses used as a binder could improve the DTG peak height and restrain the curve\nshifting effect of inorganic component on the hemicellulose and cellulose pyrolysis, but couldn’t restrain the lignin pyrolysis at low temperatures during the hemicellulose and cellulose pyrolysis. Molasses could restrain the effect of the lignin pyrolysis at\nhigh temperatures on the plastic pyrolysis. Mechanical biological treatment (MBT)\nprocess could highly improve the volatile yield and improve the DTG peak height of\nSRF briquettes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Liu, Yi"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":118813,"sim:weight":0.436069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Immediately following the earthquake a complex reconstruction\nprocess began, which introduced new urban, architectural and constructional\nconcepts. This resulted in the creation of new innovative rentable buildings\ntermed the Pombaline rentable buildings, after the Marquis of Pombal who\ndirected their construction.\nThis thesis comprises a wide ranging and detailed study of these buildings.\nAt the beginning of this work, in Chapter I, \"The Pombaline rentable building\"\nis placed in its historical context. The origins of the old city are described and its\nhistorical development within Portugal. The results and consequences of the 1755\nearthquake are outlined, and the subsequent process of reconstruction is\ndescribed. All immediate measures, decrees, and proposals for the reconstruction\nof the city, plus Manuel da Maia\u0027s Dissertations, are carefully compared and\nanalysed, as are the various plans proposed for the reconstruction.\nThe preceding periods of Portuguese Architecture are studied to identify\npossible origins for the architecture of the Pombaline rentable buildings. Also a\nclear definition of the Pombaline Rentable building and the limits of the genuine\nPombaline area are established.\nIn Chapter II the general methodology used in the research is described, which\nincludes a survey of 315 buildings and a documentary search for material\nrelating to the construction of the buildings.\nIn Chapter III an analysis is made of the general external and internal\narchitectural characteristics of the rentable buildings. An extensive search for\noriginal drawings, produced drawings only of the elevations of the main streets.\nThese are carefully analysed and compared with existing buildings and a\nclassification system is developed. A complete survey by the author of the\nbuildings\u0027 interiors, for which no documentary information exists, reveals a\ngreat complexity and variety of interior plans. To achieve a systematic\nclassification of the interiors particular aspects are analysed including, the types\nof stairs, the organization of the interior spaces, the building location and the\nfinishing details.\nChapter IV describes some of the technical innovations shown by the rentable\nbuildings, particularly those referring to earthquake resistance in construction\nand to prefabrication. During the survey of plans and elevations the Author\nidentifies evidence for the existence of prefabrication, in terms of sizes of\ncomponents, tolerances and detailing. This evidence is supported indirectly by\ndocumentary material although the extent of documentation is very limited.\nvii\nPossible evidence for an evolutionary development in the internal plan and\ndesign of the buildings based upon the position of stairs in the buildings is\npresented in Chapter V. An attempt is made to relate this classification to the dates\nof construction of the different buildings. This is achieved by an analysis of\nprevious tax records which enable numbers of buildings constructed on different\nstreets at different periods to be determined. Based on this analysis the evidence\nfor an evolutionary development is discussed.\nIn Chapter VI the Pombaline rentable buildings of Lisbon are compared with\nother contemporary developments at Porto Cövo, Vila Real and Manique do\nIntendente in order to assess the influence of the Pombaline development, both in\nterms of the architecture and the construction processes, on other construction\nprojects outside Lisbon.\nChapter VII discusses the principal findings of the research and their\nimportance in the context of Portuguese architecture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mascarenhas, Jorge Moraji Dias"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930473,"sim:weight":0.258427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58746,"sim:weight":0.239465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.215045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Key to the development of the DBA is its focus on engagement with organisations. This study explores a specific aspect of this engagement, a DBA’s potential contribution to the development of strategists.\nThe thesis is based on fourteen in-depth unstructured interviews with key respondents in the DBA community, namely, students, academic staff and staff from quasi-governmental agencies. Care was taken to select a purposeful sample of respondents who represented the range of informed perspectives on DBAs and their potential relationship with the development of strategists.\nAn inductive approach to analysing the interview transcripts was initially applied. This was done to explore the subject from as wide a perspective as possible. This inevitably produced some findings that may appear peripheral to the central research focus of this work but are in themselves worth reporting. The thesis also developed a conceptual frame consisting of key characteristics of strategists drawn from the extant literature. This frame formed the basis of a deductive analysis of the interviewee texts in order to form a perspective focused on the research aim and attendant research objectives.\nThe study identifies that there are a number of different forms of DBA and the structures of the award are still evolving. Several assumptions about the recruitment of students, such as numbers, age and experience and the relationship between the DBA and the Masters in Business Administration (MBA) are questioned.\nThe evidence in this study indicates that the DBA can have a positive influence on strategists’ key skill sets. Critically, DBAs can improve the reflective and reflexive abilities of individuals, particularly in the strategically important areas of creativity, analytical skills, communication, and strategic thinking. This,\nvii\nhowever, has not been identified by the key stakeholders within academia or outside the sector. The findings of this study might have important implications for those delivering DBAs, those intending to take a DBA, the organisations within which DBAs are placed and for government and sponsors of this form of high-level research. Thus, this study contributes to both practice and knowledge.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, William Huw"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":6117457,"ep:Repository":46,"dc:type":["Thesis","doctoral","PhD"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Representing Wales: experience on screen 1985-2010","bibo:abstract":"This doctoral submission arises from the experience of working in broadcasting in Wales over a period spanning five decades. It focuses on one of my abiding concerns throughout: the under-represented experience of the community (the post-industrial working class of the South Wales coalfield) in which I grew up – and, more broadly, of those not especially powerful or privileged, elsewhere in Wales and the world; and how, in the broadcasting mainstream, in the UK and beyond, the quantum of the representation of such experience could be increased and its quality improved. The submission consists of a portfolio of four of my documentaries - The Waste Game (1987); Everyman: A Place Like Hungerford (1988); Do Not Go Gentle (2001); and Tonypandy Riots (2011) – and an overview which examines the characteristic features of my programme-making in the context of the development of the documentary and of television in Britain; explores the nature of representation in broadcasting, and its importance in validating the complex experiences and identities of ‘peripheral’ communities in the UK; explains how my understanding of community, forged in Wales, became problematic in the eyes of the London-based press when it informed in turn my representation of a particular and traumatic English social experience; and delineates strategies I have helped to form and articulate, both within the BBC and as an independent producer, which are intended to ensure that the under-represented experience of the periphery becomes more visible on the screen.After an Introduction which examines the interrelated group of meanings bound up in the idea of ‘representation’, and explains why they were of significance to a tyro producer/director from the Rhondda, each Chapter of the overview details the genesis, production and impact of one of the four documentaries in the portfolio, in chronological order, with an intermediate Chapter covering a period I spent away from hands-on production, engaged at a senior corporate level with issues of Welsh representation on the BBC networks. A Postscript expresses my conviction that the progress in the representation of marginal experience which I have witnessed and been party to can only be truly fruitful if the imaginative human relationship between programme-makers and those they represent is one of mutual trust and respect. This submission represents a significant contribution to knowledge in several ways. First, the portfolio of documentaries and the wider corpus of my work analysed and assessed here form a high-profile cluster of broadcast output made in the English-language in Wales. Such programmes were comparative rarities when my career began, and remain under-represented on the British screen. This intimate account of the detail and context of their production adds to the limited body of academic scrutiny such work has received. Second, at a time when the relationship between ‘the devolved nations’ of the UK and England is of particular political significance, this study constitutes a detailed consideration of a dimension of ‘British’ identity beyond those of age, ethnicity, class and gender which is just as complex in terms of the implications of its representation on the screen, and deserves as much attention.   Third, this portfolio of work was produced within a broadcasting system and an institutional structure which, I argue, was signally failing to offer proportionate representation to the kind of experiences I was concerned with. This study offers a unique ‘insider’s view’ of power-struggles over the issue at the BBC and the development of a key intervention in which I was centrally involved. Finally, the portfolio itself and the broader career which it has been my privilege to enjoy are testimony to the (at least partial) efficacy of some of the strategies examined here for surmounting and moving beyond the economic barriers and cultural constraints which have historically prevented Welsh experience being fully visible, and which continue to disadvantage the Welsh producer. This account of the rationale for these strategies – and of the use made of them by the individual programme-maker and the incorporated production entity in the marketplace for factual television in the UK and beyond – may fill in some useful detail in the roadmap taking us towards a more complete representation of human experience.","bibo:AuthorList":["Geraint, John"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The important requirements for each stage of the power\nconversion of a typical induction heating system working from a three-phase supply are\nidentified. A wide range of power converters which fulfil these requirements are\ncompared and evaluated. From the evaluation, the most applicable converter topologies\nare selected. Each selected converter class is investigated in great detail to outline their\nadvantages and disadvantages.\nThe first stage consists of a push-pull buck converter connected to a unity power factor\nrectifier stage. This stage converts the three phase AC mains supply to a required DC\nvalue. The second stage, which converters the DC into AC is a single ended resonant\ninverter system.\nAnalysis of the converters has been made and the design procedure has been\nformulated. The design procedure allows a strenuous design of each resonant converter\nfor particular converter applications.\nThe final converter design has been simulated using the circuit simulation software\npackages Design Architect and Accusim to verify the results of analysis. The most\nimportant design and construction achievements can be summarised as follows:\nI\nA novel push-pull buck quasi-resonant converter with a three-phase rectifier stage has\nbeen built and tested. At its maximum operating frequency of 40kHz, the prototype\nconverter delivers an output power of 500W. The converter draws nearly sinusoidal\ncurrents from the three-phase mains supply and has an input power factor approaching\nunity.\nA secondary stage resonant converter provides AC for the induction heater coil. This\nAC current flowing in the induction coil creates an alternating electromagnetic field for\nthe workpiece. An induction heating coil has been designed and built by using electrical\nequivalent coil design method.\nA novel control strategy was developed to provide output power control. Both\nconverter and inverter stage of the system are operated in the zero-current switching\ncondition. The use of this technique allows higher switching frequencies and provides\nlow switching losses.\nThe full design details are presented along with simulation and practical results. The\nsimulation and practical performance results presented show good correlation with\ntheoretical predictions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sazak, Bekir Sami"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The model takes six main groups of independent\nvariables, namely those that affect the client, the land acquisition, the design phase,\nthe construction phase, disputes and SSH regulations. The effectiveness of the housing\nprojects was measured against quantitative and qualitative performance indicators.\nThe performance variables tested were unit cost; percentage of cost overrun; speed of\nconstruction; percentage of time overrun; client\u0027s satisfaction with cost and time;\nclient\u0027s overall satisfaction; client\u0027s rating on quality; aesthetic quality and technical\nquality.\nAs this study is the first of its kind, exploratory interviews with industry participants\nwere conducted to gain a better understanding of construction practice in Qatar as well\nas to firm up the design of the client\u0027s questionnaire, aesthetic and technical quality\nevaluation techniques.

It was\nfound that SSH regulations are not the main reason for a less effective outcome. The\nmain reasons were the unclear objectives and bad decisions made by the SSH clients.\nThe research also revealed poor quality workmanship, old construction techniques and\nthe use of inadequate construction materials. Also, a lack of, proper contract forms and\nmeans of dispute resolution. There are no institutions for consultants or contractors\nand a lack of training and development.

The complexity of the short-term load forecasting (STLF)\nproblem arises from the multiple seasonal components, the change in consumer\nbehaviour during holiday seasons and other social and religious events that affect\nelectricity consumption. The aim of this research is to produce models for electricity\ndemand that can be used to further the understanding of the dynamics of electricity\nconsumption in South Wales. These models can also be used to produce weather\ncorrected forecasts, and to provide short-term load forecasts.\nTwo novel time series modelling approaches were introduced and developed. Profiles\nARIMA (PARIMA) and the Variability Decomposition Method (VDM). PARIMA is a\nunivariate modelling approach that is based on the hierarchical modelling of the\ndifferent components of the electricity demand series as deterministic profiles, and\nmodelling the remainder stochastic component as ARIMA, serving as a simple yet\nversatile signal extraction procedure and as a powerful prewhitening technique. The\nVDM is a robust transfer function modelling approach that is based on decomposing\nthe variability in time series data to that of inherent and external. It focuses the transfer\nfunction model building on explaining the external variability of the data and produces\nmodels with parameters that are pertinent to the components of the series.\nSeveral candidate input variables for the VDM models for electricity demand were\ninvestigated, and a novel collective measure of temperature the Fair Temperature Value\n(FTV) was introduced. The FTV takes into account the changes in variance of the daily\nmaximum and minimum temperatures with time, making it a more suitable explanatory\nvariable for the VDM model.\nThe novel PARIMA and VDM approaches were used to model the quarterly, monthly,\nweekly, and daily demand series. Both approaches succeeded where existing approaches\nwere unsuccessful and, where comparisons are possible, produced models that were\nsuperior in performance. The VDM model with the FTV as its explanatory variable was\nthe best performing model in the analysis and was used for weather correction. Here,\nweather corrected forecasts were produced using the weather sensitive components of\nthe PARIMA models and the FTV transfer function component of the VDM model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Madfai, Hasan"],"dc:date":"2012-05-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":106956,"sim:weight":0.37326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31921,"sim:weight":0.279071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75591,"sim:weight":0.259754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.256636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555639,"sim:weight":0.243558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.19634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26258,"sim:weight":0.195364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.184373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10930,"sim:weight":0.155627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It also analyses the extent to which management development can facilitate further expansion and provide growth oriented firms with sustainable competitive advantages. The continued interest given to the small business sector by policy makers and academics can be attributed to the belief that these ventures will increasingly become the cornerstones of economic prosperity and wealth creation. The study draws its participants from the Wales Fast Growth Fifty Network, an initiative set up to champion the cause of growth firms in Wales. This initiative highlights that despite past successes in securing inward investment, the economic future of Wales will increasingly be 4ependent upon indigenous growth oriented businesses. The research adopts a two stage qualitative methodology and results are based upon three group interviews involving 18 growth oriented firms and a further 31 semi-structured interviews with owner-managers of growing business ventures. The phenomenon of small firm growth has been approached from a wide range of theoretical perspectives. These approaches fail however, to explain how the abilities and motivations of the entrepreneur or owner-management team shape management development. Moreover, previous studies have yet to explore the internal mechanisms of the firms and in particular the extent to which firms can manoeuvre themselves in to favourable market positions by establishing competency and knowledge based barriers to competition.  This study contends that the effective adoption of management practices and processes geared to long term market advantage is determined by the ability and experience of\nowner-managers. The research also reports that management practices such as\nmarketing, planning, quality assurance and standardisation are all routinised and utilised by growth firms to engender sources of sustainable competitive advantage. Finally, a theoretical framework is posited, utilising the concepts of an entrepreneurial and management filter developed and refined in this thesis, to explain management development and how competitive advantages merge.","bibo:AuthorList":["Packham, Gary"],"dc:date":"2012-05-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":6117464,"ep:Repository":46,"dc:type":["Thesis","doctoral","PhD"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Stabilisation of sulphide rich soil: problems and solutions","bibo:abstract":"The research presented in this thesis can be split into two well-defined areas.\nFirstly, the effects of the addition of lime (either 2%, 4%, 6% or 8%Ca(OH)2 or 1.5%, 3%,\n4.5% or 6%CaO) on various engineering properties of a sulphide (pyrites) rich, naturally\noccurring clay - Lower Oxford Clay (LOC) - were studied. Experimental tests representing,\nor relating to, tests outlined in the Design and Construction of Lime Stabilised Capping\nSpecification (DoT, 1995) were utilised and consisted of Atterberg (consistency) tests,\ncompaction tests, unconfined compressive strength tests, linear expansion measurements\nand durability tests. Also, sulphate (S03) analyses, pH measurements, differential\nthermogravinietric (DTG) analyses and X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were employed to\nconfirm experimental data. Environmental conditions were chosen to reflect temperatures\nexperienced in the UK - between 5*C, 10\u0027C and 201C. The majority of samples were\nmellowed (the time delay between initial mixing and compaction) for 3 days at 201C prior\nto testing. The results show that small additions of lime (i. e. 2%Ca(OH)2 or 1.5%CaO)\nmodify the engineering properties of LOC by causing flocculation, and also increase S03\nlevels due to increased gypsum levels via pyrites oxidation. However, strength\ndevelopment is poor as little cementitious bonding is formed. Mellowing further modifies\nthe engineering properties as the increased time allows greater flocculation leading to a less\ndense, more porous material. Also ettringite forms during mellowing allowing expansive\nreactions to occur prior to compaction, consuming both calcium and sulphate in the process\nand leading to slightly reduced pH levels compared to similar unmellowed samples. Further\nadditions of lime give further change to the engineering properties of the LOC, up to an\naddition of 6%Ca(OH)2 or 4.5%CaO. Further additions result only in supplying an excess\nof calcium. Strength development is improved with increasing lime additions, especially\nafter 4 weeks of curing at higher curing temperatures (20\u0027C); however linear expansion\nincreases and durability worsens. However, a period of mellowing prior to compaction\nreduces linear expansion and improves durability. Sulphate (S03) levels are also increased\nwith increasing additions of lime due to pyrites oxidation. In samples containing\n\u003e2%Ca(OH)2 or 1.5%CaO, pH levels are maintained to a level where ettringite formation is\nsustained rather than gypsum formation.\nSecondly, the effects of a secondary stabilising agent (ground granulated blast furnace slag\n- GGBS - incorporated at various percentage additions (2%, 4%, 6% or 8%)) on the\nstrength development, linear expansion and durability of mellowed, lime-modified LOC is\npresented. For comparative purposes, Portland cement (PC) is also used. The results show\nthat although LOC-lime-PC samples exhibit greater strengths (especially when cured for\nlong periods at 20\"C), linear expansion is lower and durability is higher in similar LOClime-\nGGBS samples. As the hydration process of PC produces lime, and as lime is usually\nconsumed during GGBS hydration, then samples containing the former stabiliser will\nmaintain pH levels well above samples containing the latter. Therefore, on soaking\ndisruption and expansion due to the formation of ettringite (which is unstable at pH levels\n\u003c10.5) is common to LOC-lime-PC samples but not in similar GGBS samples. In\nconclusion, the findings from this thesis indicate that soil stabilisation with lime and GGBS\nis particularly effective for naturally occurring sulphide rich clay soils (such as the LOC)\nand is an environmentally friendly alternative to PC-stabilised soils.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thomas, Bari Ian"],"dc:date":"2012-05-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176859,"sim:weight":0.232594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108243,"sim:weight":0.169455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108734,"sim:weight":0.139269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26546,"sim:weight":0.124271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
