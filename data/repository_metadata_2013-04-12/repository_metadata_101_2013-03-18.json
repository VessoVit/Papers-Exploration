This study examined settlement distribution and density patterns over the past five millennia using archaeological survey reports and French 1930s 1:200,000 scale maps to locate and map archaeological sites. An archaeological site dataset was created and compared to and modelled with soil, geology, terrain (contour), surface and subsurface hydrology and normal and dry year precipitation pattern datasets; there are also three spreadsheet datasets providing 1963 precipitation and temperature readings collected at three locations in the region. The environmental datasets were created to account for ancient and modern population subsistence activities, which comprise barley and wheat farming and livestock grazing. These environmental datasets were subsequently modelled with the archaeological site dataset, as well as, land use and population density datasets for the Jazira region. Ancient trade routes were also mapped and factored into the model, and a comparison was made to ascertain if there was a correlation between ancient and modern settlement patterns and environmental conditions; the latter influencing subsistence activities. This boundary dataset was generated to define the extent of the study area, which comprises the border between Syria and Turkey, Syria and Iraq, the River Tigris and the River Euphrates. All related data collected was confined within this boundary dataset with the exception of the archaeological dataset. Archaeological sites were identified and mapped along both banks of the River Euphrates. Also, the town of Dayr az-Zawr, where the 1963 precipitation and temperature monthly values were collected for one of the datasets, falls outside the Jazira Region.","bibo:AuthorList":["University of Edinburgh","Mathys, Tony"],"dc:date":"2010-06-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8998672,"sim:weight":0.235382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15538,"sim:weight":0.23399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":662190,"sim:weight":0.213576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15353,"sim:weight":0.208101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65960,"sim:weight":0.195134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.193528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.193528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386721,"sim:weight":0.159183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.1551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58011,"sim:weight":0.1531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270120,"sim:weight":0.149866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.147984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60643,"sim:weight":0.14646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26258,"sim:weight":0.143754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22854,"sim:weight":0.137387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58007,"sim:weight":0.135973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386717,"sim:weight":0.12944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61637,"sim:weight":0.126893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387168,"sim:weight":0.126189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60661,"sim:weight":0.121698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An archaeological site dataset was created and compared to and modelled with soil, geology, terrain (contour), surface and subsurface hydrology and normal and dry year precipitation pattern datasets; there are also three spreadsheet datasets providing 1963 precipitation and temperature readings collected at three locations in the region. The environmental datasets were created to account for ancient and modern population subsistence activities, which comprise barley and wheat farming and livestock grazing. These environmental datasets were subsequently modelled with the archaeological site dataset, as well as, land use and population density datasets for the Jazira region. Ancient trade routes were also mapped and factored into the model, and a comparison was made to ascertain if there was a correlation between ancient and modern settlement patterns and environmental conditions; the latter influencing subsistence activities. This archaeological dataset was generated to show settlement distribution patterns in the Jazira region of Syria. The sites were mapped using publications of surveys conducted and the French 1:200,000 maps. The French maps include the identification of sites using toponyms called \u0027Tells\u0027. The temporal extent of the archaeological sites in this dataset span from the Neolithic to Islamic periods of Syria. The extent of the archaeological site dataset comprises an area within the Syrian Jazira, which lies between the Syrian and Turkish border in the north; the Syrian and Iraqi border to the east, including the River Tigris; and to the River Euphrates to the south and west.

An archaeological site dataset was created and compared to and modelled with soil, geology, terrain (contour), surface and subsurface hydrology and normal and dry year precipitation pattern datasets; there are also three spreadsheet datasets providing 1963 precipitation and temperature readings collected at three locations in the region. The environmental datasets were created to account for ancient and modern population subsistence activities, which comprise barley and wheat farming and livestock grazing. These environmental datasets were subsequently modelled with the archaeological site dataset, as well as, land use and population density datasets for the Jazira region. Ancient trade routes were also mapped and factored into the model, and a comparison was made to ascertain if there was a correlation between ancient and modern settlement patterns and environmental conditions; the latter influencing subsistence activities. This contour dataset was generated to determine if higher elevations affected rainfall patterns, which in turn, influenced water runoff.

This study examined settlement distribution and density patterns over the past five millennia using archaeological survey reports and French 1930s 1:200,000 scale maps to locate and map archaeological sites. An archaeological site dataset was created and compared to and modelled with soil, geology, terrain (contour), surface and subsurface hydrology and normal and dry year precipitation pattern datasets; there are also three spreadsheet datasets providing 1963 precipitation and temperature readings collected at three locations in the region. The environmental datasets were created to account for ancient and modern population subsistence activities, which comprise barley and wheat farming and livestock grazing. These environmental datasets were subsequently modelled with the archaeological site dataset, as well as, land use and population density datasets for the Jazira region. Ancient trade routes were also mapped and factored into the model, and a comparison was made to ascertain if there was a correlation between ancient and modern settlement patterns and environmental conditions; the latter influencing subsistence activities. This dataset was created to show precipitation patterns for normal years in the Jazira region; annual precipitation is measured in millimetres. The purpose of mapping was to compare precipitation and settlement patterns in the region. The northern half of the Jazira region receives adequate annual rainfall to sustain dry farming activities; during dry seasons, suitable rainfall is restricted to the northern edges of the region and in higher elevations.","bibo:AuthorList":["University of Edinburgh","Mathys, Tony"],"dc:date":"2010-09-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66010,"sim:weight":0.227587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998672,"sim:weight":0.207511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.195305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.195305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15353,"sim:weight":0.1908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26258,"sim:weight":0.185231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65960,"sim:weight":0.178324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60643,"sim:weight":0.169268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270120,"sim:weight":0.164945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386721,"sim:weight":0.158218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45807,"sim:weight":0.156132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.150977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.149338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58011,"sim:weight":0.147036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98935,"sim:weight":0.142526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61637,"sim:weight":0.140514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58007,"sim:weight":0.137094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52836,"sim:weight":0.131425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387168,"sim:weight":0.12295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60661,"sim:weight":0.121431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The images were used to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and other Federal Government mapping programs. Nearly all of the imagery from these systems was collected using black and white film. There is a very limited amount of infrared film and high definition colour aerial film that was tested as part of the KH-4B missions and yielded poor spatial resolution performance. The original film is being preserved by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and is stored at the National Archives at College Park, MD. The US Geological Survey (USGS) originally delivered these images as negatives and prints to customers, but now USGS offers them as scanned images in *.tiff file formats. The images are not geo-referenced and require a Geographical Information System (GIS) or image processing package to achieve this. This CORONA image dataset was captured as part of the KH-4B mission which photographed the earth\u0027s surface from September 1967 to May 1972. The ground resolution for these images is six feet (1.8 metres). This image is identified as DS1107-2154DA071, which is coded to provide the following information: DS \u003d Dataset Name (2 characters) MMMM \u003d Revolution (4 characters) C \u003d Camera Type (1 character) FFF \u003d Frame number (3 characters) This image file is named \u003crectify1107_2154da_71b_c1.tif\u003e and is one of eight image files cropped and extracted from the original file. This was done to improve spatial accuracy, during geo-referencing of each image, and reduce file size. The original image covers an area spanning about 275 kilometres in length and 21 kilometres in width. The photo covers an area, which follows along the Syrian/Turkish border and extends east into the Sirnak Province of Turkey. The image starts just east of the Ras al Ayn settlement in Syria and extends east towards the settlement of Beytussebap, Turkey. Beytussebap is about 85km east of the River Tigris. Neither Ras al Ayn or Beytussebap can be seen on the image, but both are within 10km to the west and east respectively. This image covers an area surrounding and between two settlements in Syria, with Amuda visible at the eastern edge and Darbasiyah at the western edge of the image. As this image was captured during the summer month of August in 1969, there is very little cloud cover present; ground visibility is close to 100 percent. This image has been primarily used as part of research to locate and map archaeological sites (Tells) in this part of the Jazira region of Syria. The image also provides an important snapshot of the northern Jazira landscape in 1969. Landscape features and settlements in the region can also be mapped and compared with those from images captured recently to track and compare changes to land-use and settlement patterns in the region.","bibo:AuthorList":["University of Edinburgh","Mathys, Tony"],"dc:date":"2010-09-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":262262,"sim:weight":0.384661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65490,"sim:weight":0.370412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65531,"sim:weight":0.369731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15538,"sim:weight":0.352585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65945,"sim:weight":0.349914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269940,"sim:weight":0.342674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998672,"sim:weight":0.319186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":264478,"sim:weight":0.312298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.305244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61283,"sim:weight":0.302325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933744,"sim:weight":0.271647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61091,"sim:weight":0.263452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62192,"sim:weight":0.247184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998088,"sim:weight":0.244045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65960,"sim:weight":0.239821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98450,"sim:weight":0.237116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.232588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386721,"sim:weight":0.22954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.22802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.227536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

More than 860,000 images of the Earth\u0027s surface, collected between 1960 and 1972 have been declassified. The images were used to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and other Federal Government mapping programs. Nearly all of the imagery from these systems was collected using black and white film. There is a very limited amount of infrared film and high definition colour aerial film that was tested as part of the KH-4B missions and yielded poor spatial resolution performance. The original film is being preserved by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and is stored at the National Archives at College Park, MD. The US Geological Survey (USGS) originally delivered these images as negatives and prints to customers, but now USGS offers them as scanned images in *.tiff file formats. The images are not geo-referenced and require a Geographical Information System (GIS) or image processing package to achieve this. This CORONA image dataset was captured as part of the KH-4B mission which photographed the earth\u0027s surface from September 1967 to May 1972. The ground resolution for these images is six feet (1.8 metres). This image is identified as DS1107-2154DA071, which is coded to provide the following information: DS \u003d Dataset Name (2 characters) MMMM \u003d Revolution (4 characters) C \u003d Camera Type (1 character) FFF \u003d Frame number (3 characters) This image file is named \u003crectify1107_2154da_71a_c1.tif\u003e and is one of eight image files cropped and extracted from the original file. This was done to improve spatial accuracy, during geo-referencing of each image, and reduce file size. The original image covers an area spanning about 275 kilometres in length and 21 kilometres in width. The photo covers an area, which follows along the Syrian/Turkish border and extends east into the Sirnak Province of Turkey. The image starts just east of the Ras al Ayn settlement in Syria and extends east towards the settlement of Beytussebap, Turkey. Beytussebap is about 85km east of the River Tigris. Neither Ras al Ayn or Beytussebap can be seen on the image, but both are within 10km to the west and east respectively. This image covers an area surrounding and between two settlements in Syria, with Amuda visible at the eastern edge and Darbasiyah at the western edge of the image. As this image was captured during the summer month of August in 1969, there is very little cloud cover present; ground visibility is close to 100 percent. This image has been primarily used as part of research to locate and map archaeological sites (Tells) in this part of the Jazira region of Syria.
