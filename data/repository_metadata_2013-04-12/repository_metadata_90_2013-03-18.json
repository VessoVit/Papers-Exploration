Our objectives were to identify the methods used by pharmacists to communicate and document patient care issues, to explore pharmacists\u0027 attitudes towards documentation of patient care issues in health records, to identify and examine the factors influencing whether or not pharmacists document their care in health records and to make recommendations to inform development of a training programme to educate pharmacists regarding documentation in health records. METHODS: Methods included a questionnaire and focus groups. The study poulation was 40 clinical pharmacists in a 900-bed London teaching hospital. KEY FINDINGS: Thirty-nine pharmacists completed the questionnaire and 32 attended a focus group. Questionnaire responses indicated that 29 (74%) pharmacists did not write in patient health records; most preferred temporary notes. However, most respondents agreed that documenting their input in the health record was important. Few pharmacists believed that writing in health records would affect the doctor-pharmacist or patient-doctor relationship, or felt that health-record availability or time were barriers. Most knew when, how and which issues to document; however, most wanted more training. Focus-group discussions revealed that pharmacists feared litigation and criticism from doctors when writing in health records. Pharmacists\u0027 written communication in health records was also influenced by the perceived significance and appropriateness of clinical issues, pharmacists\u0027 acceptance by doctors, and pharmacists\u0027 \u0027ownership\u0027 of the health record. CONCLUSIONS: While recognising the importance of documenting relevant issues in health records, pharmacists rarely did so in practice and preferred to use oral communication or temporary adhesive notes instead. Pharmacists need to overcome their fear of criticism and litigation in order to document more appropriately in health records. A trust policy and training may offer pharmacists a sense of protection, enabling more confident documentation in patients\u0027 health records.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pullinger, W.","Franklin, B.D."],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1211/ijpp.18.02.0006.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.478738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185982,"sim:weight":0.444948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99600,"sim:weight":0.40393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.402795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43411,"sim:weight":0.356096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76136,"sim:weight":0.344894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75615,"sim:weight":0.329258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43609,"sim:weight":0.326527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385794,"sim:weight":0.326072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795344,"sim:weight":0.325749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1655008,"sim:weight":0.325695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.320703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.316612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.31452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111817,"sim:weight":0.311174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60745,"sim:weight":0.309365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.306831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.306317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.300483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70031,"sim:weight":0.295498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Design A controlled before and after design. Five substudies: survey of staff attitudes; review of case notes from high risk (respiratory) patients in medical wards; review of case notes from surgical patients; indirect evaluation of hand hygiene by measuring hospital use of handwashing materials; measurement of outcomes (adverse events, mortality among high risk patients admitted to medical wards, patients\u0027 satisfaction, mortality in intensive care, rates of hospital acquired infection). Setting NHS hospitals in England. Participants Nine hospitals participating in SPI2 and nine matched control hospitals. Intervention The SPI2 intervention was similar to the SPI1, with somewhat modified goals, a slightly longer intervention period, and a smaller budget per hospital. Results One of the scores (organisational climate) showed a significant (P\u003d0.009) difference in rate of change over time, which favoured the control hospitals, though the difference was only 0.07 points on a five point scale. Results of the explicit case note reviews of high risk medical patients showed that certain practices improved over time in both control and SPI2 hospitals (and none deteriorated), but there were no significant differences between control and SPI2 hospitals. Monitoring of vital signs improved across control and SPI2 sites. This temporal effect was significant for monitoring the respiratory rate at both the six hour (adjusted odds ratio 2.1, 99% confidence interval 1.0 to 4.3; P\u003d0.010) and 12 hour (2.4, 1.1 to 5.0; P\u003d0.002) periods after admission. There was no significant effect of SPI for any of the measures of vital signs. Use of a recommended system for scoring the severity of pneumonia improved from 1.9% (1/52) to 21.4% (12/56) of control and from 2.0% (1/50) to 41.7% (25/60) of SPI2 patients. This temporal change was significant (7.3, 1.4 to 37.7; P\u003d0.002), but the difference in difference was not significant (2.1, 0.4 to 11.1; P\u003d0.236). There were no notable or significant changes in the pattern of prescribing errors, either over time or between control and SPI2 hospitals. Two items of medical history taking (exercise tolerance and occupation) showed significant improvement over time, across both control and SPI2 hospitals, but no additional SPI2 effect. The holistic review showed no significant changes in error rates either over time or between control and SPI2 hospitals. The explicit case note review of perioperative care showed that adherence rates for two of the four perioperative standards targeted by SPI2 were already good at baseline, exceeding 94% for antibiotic prophylaxis and 98% for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Intraoperative monitoring of temperature improved over time in both groups, but this was not significant (1.8, 0.4 to 7.6; P\u003d0.279), and there were no additional effects of SPI2. A dramatic rise in consumption of soap and alcohol hand rub was similar in control and SPI2 hospitals (P\u003d0.760 and P\u003d0.889, respectively), as was the corresponding decrease in rates of Clostridium difficile and meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (P\u003d0.652 and P\u003d0.693, respectively). Mortality rates of medical patients included in the case note reviews in control hospitals increased from 17.3% (42/ 243) to 21.4% (24/112), while in SPI2 hospitals they fell from 10.3% (24/233) to 6.1% (7/114) (P\u003d0.043). Fewer than 8% of deaths were classed as avoidable; changes in proportions could not explain the divergence of overall death rates between control and SPI2 hospitals. There was no significant difference in the rate of change in mortality in intensive care. Patients\u0027 satisfaction improved in both control and SPI2 hospitals on all dimensions, but again there were no significant changes between the two groups of hospitals. Conclusions Many aspects of care are already good or improving across the NHS in England, suggesting considerable improvements in quality across the board. These improvements are probably due to contemporaneous policy activities relating to patient safety, including those with features similar to the SPI, and the emergence of professional consensus on some clinical processes. This phenomenon might have attenuated the incremental effect of the SPI, making it difficult to detect. Alternatively, the full impact of the SPI might be observable only in the longer term. The conclusion of this study could have been different if concurrent controls had not been used.","bibo:AuthorList":["Benning, A.","Dixon-Woods, M.","Nwulu, U.","Ghaleb, M.A.","Dawson, J.","Barber, N.","Franklin, B.D.","Girling, A.","Hemming, K.","Carmalt, M.","Rudge, G.","Naicker, T.","Kotecha, A.","Derrington, M.C.","Lilford, R.J."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45736,"sim:weight":0.732743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49820,"sim:weight":0.49367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.409163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.3881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.374856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.369502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.368975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.359561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.359561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.357563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.343435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.332147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.332147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.332147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.332147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.332147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.332147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.332147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.332147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.332147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The clathrin adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex is a critical regulator of GABAAR endocytosis and, hence, surface receptor number. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized atypical AP2 binding motif conserved within the intracellular domains of all GABAAR β subunit isoforms. This AP2 binding motif (KTHLRRRSSQLK in the β3 subunit) incorporates the major sites of serine phosphorylation within receptor β subunits, and phosphorylation within this site inhibits AP2 binding. Furthermore, by using surface plasmon resonance, we establish that a peptide (pepβ3) corresponding to the AP2 binding motif in the GABAAR β3 subunit binds to AP2 with high affinity only when dephosphorylated. Moreover, the pepβ3 peptide, but not its phosphorylated equivalent (pepβ3-phos), enhanced the amplitude of miniature inhibitory synaptic current and whole cell GABAAR current. These effects of pepβ3 on GABAAR current were occluded by inhibitors of dynamin-dependent endocytosis supporting an action of pepβ3 on GABAAR endocytosis. Therefore phospho-dependent regulation of AP2 binding to GABAARs provides a mechanism to specify receptor cell surface number and the efficacy of inhibitory synaptic transmission.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kittler, J.T.","Chen, G.C.","Honing, S.","Bogdanov, Y.","McAinsh, K.","Arancibia-Carcamo , L.","Jovanovic, J.N.","Pangalos, M.N.","Haucke, V.","Yan, Z.","Moss, S.J."],"dc:date":"2005","doi":"10.1073/pnas.0506653102","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":333357,"sim:weight":0.499864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99720,"sim:weight":0.407782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.36124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113655,"sim:weight":0.28141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111777,"sim:weight":0.258388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145468,"sim:weight":0.198061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.190625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.190199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111762,"sim:weight":0.189804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.182121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779642,"sim:weight":0.180708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222903,"sim:weight":0.175163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223000,"sim:weight":0.173929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.1736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.164354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.162511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773164,"sim:weight":0.159644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4881258,"sim:weight":0.157585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.155789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76954,"sim:weight":0.155085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of these, which has been obtained in full-length form, encodes a 383-amino acid protein that exhibits greatest sequence similarity to mammalian mu-opioid receptors; the corresponding gene is expressed predominantly in brain and pituitary. Transfection of the teleost cDNA into HEK 293 cells resulted in the appearance of a receptor having high affinity for the mu-selective agonist [D-Ala2, MePhe4-Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO) (Kd \u003d 0.63 +/- 0.15 nM) and for the nonselective antagonist naloxone (Kd \u003d 3.1 +/- 1.3 nM). The receptor had negligible affinity for U50488 and [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE), which are kappa- and delta-opioid receptor selective agonists, respectively. Stimulation of transfected cells with 1 microM DAMGO lowered forskolin-induced cAMP levels, an effect that could be reversed by naloxone. Experiments in Xenopus oocytes have demonstrated that the fish opioid receptor can, in an agonist-dependent fashion, activate a coexpressed mouse G-protein-gated inward-rectifying potassium channel (GIRK1). The identification of six distinct fish opioid receptor-like proteins suggests that additional mammalian opioid receptors remain to be identified at the molecular level. Furthermore, our data indicate that the mu-opioid receptor arose very early in evolution, perhaps before the appearance of vertebrates, and that the pharmacological and functional properties of this receptor have been conserved over a period of approximately 400 million years implying that it fulfills an important physiological role.","bibo:AuthorList":["Darlison, M.G.","Greten, F.R.","Harvey, R.J.","Kreienkamp, H.J.","Stühmer, T.","Zwiers, H.","Lederis, K.","Richter, D."],"dc:date":"1997","doi":"10.1073/pnas.94.15.8214.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.358654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98640,"sim:weight":0.27875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.268761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105296,"sim:weight":0.265055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387403,"sim:weight":0.263328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98668,"sim:weight":0.261525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46589,"sim:weight":0.256798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101408,"sim:weight":0.241996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98672,"sim:weight":0.240704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43352,"sim:weight":0.23689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98670,"sim:weight":0.215388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.214363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.209752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.20518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98669,"sim:weight":0.204375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.203895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184423,"sim:weight":0.201592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.197275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46577,"sim:weight":0.191749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99336,"sim:weight":0.187244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Hydrophobic groups of cetyl, palmitoyl and cholesteryl were randomly grafted to PAA and quaternisation was carried out on some modified polymers. Polymers were characterised using H-1 NMR, elemental analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. All polymers formed nano self-assemblies in the aqueous solution with a positive zeta potential and were able to encapsulate a hydrophobic agent, methyl orange, in the core. The critical aggregation concentration (CAC) and the microviscosity were found to be dependent on the polymer hydrophobicity. Being the most hydrophobic polymer, cholesteryl-grafted PAA had the lowest CAC (0.02 mg mL(-1)) and the highest microviscosity. They appeared to form dense nanoparticles and were transformed into novel nanostructures in the presence of free cholesterol. Palmitoyl-grafted polymers formed nanoparticles while cetyl-grafted polymers formed polymeric micelles. The flexibility of cetyl chains possibly resulted in the formation of multicore polymeric micelles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thompson, C.J.","Ding, C.X.","Qu, X.Z.","Yang, Z.Z.","Uchegbu, I.F.","Tetley, L.","Cheng, W.P."],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1007/s00396-008-1925-8","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":385531,"sim:weight":0.466677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.456645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.450507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108317,"sim:weight":0.376858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44222,"sim:weight":0.365811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98706,"sim:weight":0.363533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108077,"sim:weight":0.36254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77031,"sim:weight":0.360908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77025,"sim:weight":0.35656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105106,"sim:weight":0.344473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46911,"sim:weight":0.33228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43648,"sim:weight":0.303933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101462,"sim:weight":0.282318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890299,"sim:weight":0.279151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12371,"sim:weight":0.26788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930233,"sim:weight":0.26446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113585,"sim:weight":0.263437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113586,"sim:weight":0.263437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387366,"sim:weight":0.253956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145592,"sim:weight":0.237452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This popularity is reflected in the number of commercially available instruments which are capable of yielding a variety of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Whilst there has been much discussion of ways in which to validate any values returned from these instruments very little has been done quantitatively to compare the relative performances of different instruments. This paper highlights the use of a test and reference reaction quantitatively to compare the performance of three instruments (Thermometric TAM, THT μRC and a Setaram HSDSC III); the specifications of these instruments provide a range from high-sensitivity, long equilibration time to lower-sensitivity, short equilibration time. The comparison is made through a statistical analysis of values returned for the rate constant, enthalpy of reaction and activation energy for the base catalysed hydrolysis of methyl paraben. The statistical analysis from the data set discussed here indicates that there is no significant difference between the returned thermodynamic and kinetic parameters from the TAM and μRC. The analysis revealed however that the HSDSC returns values for the rate constant which are significantly different from both the TAM and μRC, although it is noted that this instrument was not specifically designed to operate in a step-isothermal mode and that it was possible to apply a correction to the data. In all cases the enthalpy data returned from all instruments were statistically similar although the μRC and HSDSC returned values which were, for the rate constant and activation energy, less precise than those obtained from the TAM. As well as highlighting the importance of using test and reference reactions, this study also shows that proper instrument selection is an important factor when designing a calorimetric experimental series.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Neill, M.A.A.","Gaisford, S.","Beezer, A.E.","Skaria, C.V.","Sears, P."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1650745,"sim:weight":0.395117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43511,"sim:weight":0.360133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.327886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.311424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.297026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43103,"sim:weight":0.286258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In addition, the influence \r\nof gender, age, hand size and hand dominance on the transverse fingernail curvature was \r\ninvestigated. The transverse fingernail curvature in 92 males and 90 females (aged 21-90 \r\nyears) was measured using a set of radius gauges, and the nail plate curvature was \r\nexpressed as the radius of a circle whose curve most closely approximated that of the nail \r\nplate.

There was a small (0.08 points on a 5 point scale) but significant (P\u003c0.01) effect in favour of the SPI1 hospitals in one of 11 dimensions of the staff questionnaire (organisational climate). Qualitative evidence showed only modest penetration of SPI1 at medical ward level. Although SPI1 was designed to engage staff from the bottom up, it did not usually feel like this to those working on the wards, and questions about legitimacy of some aspects of SPI1 were raised. Of the five components to identify patients at risk of deterioration-monitoring of vital signs (14 items); routine tests (three items); evidence based standards specific to certain diseases (three items); prescribing errors (multiple items from the British National Formulary); and medical history taking (11 items)-there was little net difference between control and SPI1 hospitals, except in relation to quality of monitoring of acute medical patients, which improved on average over time across all hospitals. Recording of respiratory rate increased to a greater degree in SPI1 than in control hospitals; in the second six hours after admission recording increased from 40% (93) to 69% (165) in control hospitals and from 37% (141) to 78% (296) in SPI1 hospitals (odds ratio for \"difference in difference\" 2.1, 99% confidence interval 1.0 to 4.3; P\u003d0.008). Use of a formal scoring system for patients with pneumonia also increased over time (from 2% (102) to 23% (111) in control hospitals and from 2% (170) to 9% (189) in SPI1 hospitals), which favoured controls and was not significant (0.3, 0.02 to 3.4; P\u003d0.173). There were no improvements in the proportion of prescription errors and no effects that could be attributed to SPI1 in non-targeted generic areas (such as enhanced safety culture). On some measures, the lack of effect could be because compliance was already high at baseline (such as use of steroids in over 85% of cases where indicated), but even when there was more room for improvement (such as in quality of medical history taking), there was no significant additional net effect of SPI1. There were no changes over time or between control and SPI1 hospitals in errors or rates of adverse events in patients in medical wards. Mortality increased from 11% (27) to 16% (39) among controls and decreased from17%(63) to 13% (49) among SPI1 hospitals, but the risk adjusted difference was not significant (0.5, 0.2 to 1.4; P\u003d0.085). Poor care was a contributing factor in four of the 178 deaths identified by review of case notes. The survey of patients showed no significant differences apart from an increase in perception of cleanliness in favour of SPI1 hospitals.\r\n\r\nConclusions The introduction of SPI1 was associated with improvements in one of the types of clinical process studied (monitoring of vital signs) and one measure of staff perceptions of organisational climate. There was no additional effect of SPI1 on other targeted issues nor on other measures of generic organisational strengthening.","bibo:AuthorList":["Benning, A.","Ghaleb, M.A.","Suokas, A.","Dixon-Woods, M.","Dawson, J.","Barber, N.","Franklin, B.D.","Girling, A.","Hemming, K.","Carmalt, M.","Rudge, G.","Naicker, T.","Nwulu, U.","Choudhury, S.","Lilford, R.J."],"dc:date":"2011-02","doi":"10.1136/bmj.d195.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.805555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10813,"sim:weight":0.732743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49820,"sim:weight":0.372943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43609,"sim:weight":0.356293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99600,"sim:weight":0.327014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.315584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.29339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.293346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.281347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.280548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.275104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.268667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.262459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.262459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.262459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.262459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.262459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.262459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.262459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.262459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Chalcones represent an important group of the polyphenolic family, which includes a large number of naturally occurring molecules. This family possesses an interesting spectrum of biological activities, including antioxidative, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, cytotoxic, and immunosuppressive potential. Compounds of this family have been shown to interfere with each step of carcinogenesis, including initiation, promotion and progression. Moreover, numerous compounds from the family of dietary chalcones appear to show activity against cancer cells, suggesting that these molecules or their derivatives may be considered as potential anticancer drugs. This review will focus primarily on prominent members of the chalcone family with an 1,3-diphenyl-2-propenon core structure. Specifically, the inhibitory effects of these compounds on the different steps of carcinogenesis that reveal interesting chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential will be discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Orlikova, B.","Tasdemir, D.","Golais, F.","Dicato, M.","Diederich, M."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1007/s12263-011-0210-5.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1141983,"sim:weight":0.590517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":625113,"sim:weight":0.435439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5687666,"sim:weight":0.417703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99171,"sim:weight":0.410187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.406898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1094642,"sim:weight":0.380548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1091380,"sim:weight":0.361027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13169,"sim:weight":0.35907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":698649,"sim:weight":0.357896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23815,"sim:weight":0.351786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.350986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1132101,"sim:weight":0.35017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99692,"sim:weight":0.347884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.343628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5700360,"sim:weight":0.339498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":835124,"sim:weight":0.331798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1098674,"sim:weight":0.329434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":923267,"sim:weight":0.328075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.324908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779642,"sim:weight":0.324071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The absence of an effective vaccine and the spread of drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium clearly indicate the necessity for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents and the identification of novel targets. The recent discovery of a relict, non-photosynthetic plastid-like organelle, the so-called apicoplast, in Plasmodium has opened up new avenues in malaria research. It also initiated the Plasmodium falciparum genome sequencing project, which revealed a number of biochemical pathways previously unknown to Plasmodium, i.e. cytosolic shikimate pathway, apicoplastic type II fatty acid, non-mevalonate isoprene and haem biosyntheses. Since these vital biosynthetic processes are absent in humans or fundamentally different from those found in humans, they represent excellent targets for pharmaceutical interventions. We are interested in the type II fatty acid synthase (FAS II) system of malaria parasite and focus on the FabI enzyme, the only known enoyl-ACP reductase in Plasmodium involved in the final reduction step of the fatty acid chain elongation cycle. Here we describe the general aspects of fatty acid biosynthesis, its essentiality to the malaria parasite and our continuing efforts to discover in Turkish medicinal plants natural antimalarial agents, which specifically target the plasmodial FabI enzyme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tasdemir, Deniz"],"dc:date":"2006","doi":"10.1007/s11101-005-5297-0.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":677111,"sim:weight":0.395616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.276526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772412,"sim:weight":0.251749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731993,"sim:weight":0.249093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931556,"sim:weight":0.248844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.246035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75329,"sim:weight":0.236178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.230984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780372,"sim:weight":0.23062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.224205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.212331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.203958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.190599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.182814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101909,"sim:weight":0.182165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146199,"sim:weight":0.181228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.177998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12359,"sim:weight":0.176414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.173094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631958,"sim:weight":0.173035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Pyramidal cells with cortico-cortical like morphology were 2-4 times more likely to innervate other pyramidal cells than were cortico-thalamic like cells, but less likely to innervate inhibitory interneurons. The excitatory postsynaptic potentials elicited by presynaptic, phasically firing cortico-cortical pyramids in all classes of postsynaptic infragranular layer pyramidal cells exhibited strong, presynaptically mediated paired pulse and brief train depression. Those with larger paired pulse ratios also exhibited post-tetanic potentiation, but this was accompanied by stronger paired pulse and brief train depression. Both the firing characteristics and the outputs of cortico-cortical pyramidal cells display pronounced phasic characteristics, indicating that these cells respond most effectively to and preferentially pass on information related to novelty.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mercer, A.","West, D.C.","Morris, O.T.","Kirchhecker, S.","Kerkhoff, J.E.","Thomson, A.M."],"dc:date":"2005","doi":"10.1093/cercor","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99522,"sim:weight":0.833054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99675,"sim:weight":0.573249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111762,"sim:weight":0.408869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387160,"sim:weight":0.340811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76477,"sim:weight":0.321895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584828,"sim:weight":0.271502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382406,"sim:weight":0.245291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98823,"sim:weight":0.236192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501129,"sim:weight":0.235345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84743,"sim:weight":0.235295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145863,"sim:weight":0.224683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":544689,"sim:weight":0.21865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.218513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46533,"sim:weight":0.203757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.200095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.19669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.1941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.188336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.188336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387384,"sim:weight":0.186413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Non-familial cases may be idiopathic, or associated with pathology usually in the brainstem or rarely in the supratentorial compartment. The pathophysiological basis of HE is unclear.\r\nWe report the case of a 40-yearold woman presenting with excessive startle response to unexpected stimuli and falls since the age of 16 years. There was no family history. She was initially diagnosed with epilepsy and started on phenytoin with no resolution of her symptoms. Clinical examination revealed hyperreflexia and an insecure broad-based gait but no other abnormalities. Routine comprehensive neuropsychological assessment revealed below average intelligence with signs of frontal lobe dysfunction. EEG showed non-specific abnormalities in the right frontal and central regions. A 99mTc-HMPAO SPET scan revealed hypoperfusion in the frontal (worse on the right) and temporal lobes and to a lesser extent in the basal ganglia. MRI was normal, as well as blood and CSF tests. No mutations were found in a genetic analysis of GLRA1. The patient improved partially with treatment by clonazepam.\r\nThe localisation of the clinical and neuropsychological findings accord with the EEG and SPET scan abnormalities in our patient and corroborates previous reports.

The cells were filled with biocytin and identified morphologically and, where appropriate, immunofluorescently. CT-like pyramids contacted interneurons with a very high probability (up to 1:2) but contacted other layer 6 pyramidal cells only rarely (approximately 1:80). The excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that they elicited both in pyramidal cells and in a variety of types of interneurons (including those immunopositive for parvalbumin and for somatostatin) facilitated, the second EPSP being larger than the first over a range of interspike intervals. Facilitation was not, however, maximal at the shortest intervals; in fact, depression was apparent at some connections at short interspike intervals. Facilitation in the majority of connections peaked at intervals of 25-35 ms and then declined slowly. Nor did these connections display the augmentation typical of many other strongly facilitating connections. Third EPSPs were smaller on average than second EPSPs, and fourth and subsequent EPSPs could be depressed (relative to first EPSPs). The properties of the outputs of these CT-like pyramidal cells are therefore quite distinct from those of other pyramidal cells, both within layer 6 and in other layers, possibly reflecting their unique role as both first order thalamo-cortical recipient and cortico-thalamic output neurons.","bibo:AuthorList":["West, D.C.","Mercer, A.","Kirchhecker, S.","Morris, O.T.","Thomson, A.M."],"dc:date":"2006","doi":"10.1093/cercor","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99516,"sim:weight":0.833054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99675,"sim:weight":0.456887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111762,"sim:weight":0.391807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387160,"sim:weight":0.301512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76477,"sim:weight":0.290387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584828,"sim:weight":0.227783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382406,"sim:weight":0.220074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98823,"sim:weight":0.207997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75275,"sim:weight":0.197006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501129,"sim:weight":0.195122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84743,"sim:weight":0.19489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145863,"sim:weight":0.187808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.185096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":544689,"sim:weight":0.183944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.18215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76105,"sim:weight":0.179609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46533,"sim:weight":0.176109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.175436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.174781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.172606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Method: 10 doctors, 10 nurses, and 10 pharmacists from German hospitals were asked to score the potential clinical significance of 49 cases of medication administration errors on a visual analogue scale. Main outcome measure: Generalisability theory was used to determine the minimum number of judges required to obtain a reliable mean score. Validity was assessed by comparing the mean scores given by the judges to the known outcome of the errors for a subset of the cases. German results were compared to original UK data. Results: The scores of 27 judges could be used (nine from each profession). At least three health professionals, one from each profession, were required to achieve a generalisability coefficient of 0.86, indicating acceptable reliability. The mean scores were found to be valid indicators of the potential severity of the errors. German scores were significantly below UK scores for the same cases. Conclusion: The mean score calculated from scores given by one doctor, one nurse and one pharmacist from the population of German health professionals was a valid and reliable measure of the potential clinical significance of medication administration errors. That German health professionals see cases as less dangerous than their UK counterparts is worthy of further investigation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Taxis, K.","Dean, B.","Barber, N."],"dc:date":"2002","doi":"10.1023/A","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43609,"sim:weight":0.469929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385794,"sim:weight":0.461827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99714,"sim:weight":0.455674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.39919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.321788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656477,"sim:weight":0.318787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.318164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.310801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77300,"sim:weight":0.299052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99033,"sim:weight":0.297907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.293565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.293049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":286331,"sim:weight":0.280531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18046,"sim:weight":0.276554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.274568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.274368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.27326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101531,"sim:weight":0.272546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177092,"sim:weight":0.269014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.261467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Some of these patients could be discharged earlier if a switch to an oral antibiotic was made. This study was designed to identify the percentage of inpatients currently prescribed IV glycopeptides who could be discharged earlier if a switch to an oral agent was used, and to estimate the number of bed days that could be saved. We also aimed to identify the patient group(s) most likely to benefit, and to estimate the number of days of IV therapy that could be prevented in patients who remained in hospital. \r\nMethods  \r\nPatients were included if they were prescribed an IV glycopeptide for 5 days or more. Predetermined IV to oral antibiotic switch criteria and discharge criteria were applied. A multiple logistic regression model was used to identify the characteristics of the patients most likely to be suitable for earlier discharge. \r\nResults  \r\nOf 211 patients, 62 (29%) could have had a reduced length of stay if they were treated with a suitable oral antibiotic. This would have saved a total of 649 inpatient days (median 5 per patient; range 1–54). A further 31 patients (15%) could have switched to oral therapy as an inpatient thus avoiding IV line use. The patients most likely to be suitable for early discharge were those with skin and soft tissue infection, under the cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, orthopaedics, general medical, plastic surgery and vascular specialities, with no high risk comorbidity and less than five other regularly prescribed drugs. \r\nConclusion  \r\nThe need for glycopeptide therapy has a significant impact on length of stay. Effective targeting of oral antimicrobials could reduce the need for IV access, allow outpatient treatment and thus reduce the length of stay in patients with infections caused by antibiotic resistant gram-positive bacteria.","bibo:AuthorList":["Desai, M.","Bamford, K.B.","Trust, S.","Franklin, B.D.","Richards, M.","Jacklin, A.","Holmes, A."],"dc:date":"2006-06","doi":"10.1186/1471-2334-6-94.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.409225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.373242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.367535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.362433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43487,"sim:weight":0.318806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.306608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.304465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101310,"sim:weight":0.303996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664714,"sim:weight":0.303718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.28232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.280769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.279689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1151822,"sim:weight":0.256918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102732,"sim:weight":0.253673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49820,"sim:weight":0.253644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.247599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.247546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.247546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.247546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.247546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Despite mounting circumstantial evidence\r\nthat pyramidal cells are also coupled, the paucity of direct evidence has made this controversial.\r\nDual intracellular recordings from pairs of cortical and hippocampal pyramids demonstrated strong,\r\nbut sparse coupling. Approximately 70% of CA1 pyramids close to the stratum radiatum border were\r\ncoupled to another pyramid, but only to one or two of their very closest neighbours. On average 25%\r\nof the steady state and 10% of the peak action potential voltage change in one cell transferred to the\r\nother, supporting synchrony and promoting burst firing.

Setting Two Paediatric Oncology Centres in the UK. Methods A semi-structured questionnaire was developed in consultation with professionals working within paediatric oncology. Questionnaires were administered in face-to-face interviews with parents of patients attending clinic appointments. Responses to questions were coded and entered into a database for descriptive and inferential analyses. Responses to open questions were coded using simple thematic analysis whereby codes and themes emerged from the data and were compared and contrasted between respondents. Findings were further validated by quotes from interviewees to open questions. Main outcome measures Awareness and knowledge of medicines, information needs and handling procedures. Results Fifty-five interviews were conducted. Most interviewees viewed oral and intravenous chemotherapy as equally important and potent. Three-quarters of parents were aware of the adverse effects chemotherapy could have on them, worryingly three-quarters of the same group of parents did not use all the handling precaution methods advised by health care professionals. Knowledge of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia maintenance treatment was assessed in 47 interviewees; 31 parents were able to explain the reasons for maintenance chemotherapy. Interviewees felt well informed by the hospital and found it easy to access information they needed. The data suggest the majority of parents had a great interest in understanding the disease and treatment, with 91% using the internet to access further information. Three-quarters of parents faced some kind of difficulty when dealing with oral chemotherapy, including problems with the patient not taking the drug, technical and supply problems and problems following the drug regimen. Self-reported compliance in this study was high with 69.1% of interviewees stating they never forgot a single dose. 72.2% of interviewees used a reminder method, of which 81.6% were written reminders. Conclusion This study highlights that although the support systems offered by the paediatric oncology centres were good, certain areas need improvement, specifically the manner in which parents/carers are educated and informed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Christensen, N.","Taylor, K.M.G.","Duggan, C."],"dc:date":"2008-10","doi":"10.1007/s11096-008-9208-5.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.402518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.383269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101445,"sim:weight":0.378602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.374531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.370948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667807,"sim:weight":0.34596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43609,"sim:weight":0.34143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43411,"sim:weight":0.340826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.337826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.325959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664714,"sim:weight":0.30924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.307903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.3063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.3063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.3063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.3063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.3063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.3063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.3063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.3063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Hyperekplexia is characterised by an exaggerated startle reflex in response to tactile or acoustic stimuli which first presents as neonatal hypertonia, followed in some with episodes of life-threatening infantile apnoea. Genetic screening studies have demonstrated that hyperekplexia is genetically heterogeneous with several missense and nonsense mutations in the postsynaptic glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha1 subunit gene (GLRA1) as the primary cause. More recently, missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations have also been identified in the glycine transporter GlyT2 gene, SLC6A5, demonstrating a presynaptic component to this disease. Further mutations, albeit rare, have been identified in the genes encoding the GlyR beta subunit (GLRB), collybistin (ARHGEF9) and gephyrin (GPHN) - all of which are postsynaptic proteins involved in orchestrating glycinergic neurotransmission. In this review, we describe the clinical ascertainment aspects, phenotypic considerations and the downstream molecular genetic tools utilised to analyse both presynaptic and postsynaptic components of this heterogeneous human neurological disorder. Moreover, we will describe how the ancient startle response is the preserve of glycinergic neurotransmission and how animal models and human hyperekplexia patients have provided synergistic evidence that implicates this inhibitory system in the control of startle reflexes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, J.S.","Chung, S-K.","Thomas, R.H.","Robinson, A.","Hammond, C.L.","Mullins, J.G.","Carta, E.","Pearce, B.R.","Harvey, K.","Harvey, R.J.","Rees, M.I."],"dc:date":"2010-03","doi":"10.3389/fnmol.2010.00008.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":111782,"sim:weight":0.561675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111781,"sim:weight":0.548804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99520,"sim:weight":0.526439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99672,"sim:weight":0.462804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.351733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266339,"sim:weight":0.33898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113360,"sim:weight":0.311929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111796,"sim:weight":0.289649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387096,"sim:weight":0.281092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.272197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.244038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7223,"sim:weight":0.239816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98535,"sim:weight":0.231648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57864,"sim:weight":0.228751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.218636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1458936,"sim:weight":0.213616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.198386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632025,"sim:weight":0.19576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710687,"sim:weight":0.193602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98483,"sim:weight":0.190897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Nevertheless, after the administration of some anti-neoplastic agents (e.g. busulphan, BU) under conditions as yet undefined, the marrow may begin a return towards normal, but normality may not be achieved, and late-stage/residual marrow injury may be evident. The present studies were conducted to develop a short-term mouse model (a ‘screen’) to identify late-stage/residual marrow injury using a brief regimen of drug administration. Female BALB/c mice were treated with BU, doxorubicin (DOX), cisplatin (CISPLAT) or cyclophosphamide (CYCLOPHOS) on days 1, 3 and 5. In ‘preliminary studies’, a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each drug was determined for use in ‘main studies’. In main studies, mice were treated with vehicle (control), low and high (the MTD) dose levels of each agent. Necropsies were performed, and blood parameters and femoral/humeral nucleated marrow cell counts (FNCC/HNCC) were assessed on six occasions (from days 1 to 60/61 post-dosing). Late-stage/residual changes were apparent in BU-treated mice at day 61 post-dosing: RBC, Hb and haematocrit were reduced, mean cell volume/mean cell haemoglobin were increased and platelet and FNCC counts were decreased. Mice given DOX, CISPLAT and CYCLOPHOS, in general, showed no clear late-stage/residual effects (day 60/61). It was concluded that a brief regimen of drug administration, at an MTD, with assessment at day 60/61 post-dosing was a suitable short-term method/screen in the mouse for detecting late-stage/residual marrow injury for BU, a drug shown to exhibit these effects in man.","bibo:AuthorList":["Molyneux, G.","Andrews, M.","Sones, W.R.","York, M.J.","Barnett, A.","Quirk, E.","Yeung, W.","Turton, J.A."],"dc:date":"2010-06","doi":"10.1007/s10565-010-9167-1.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":746631,"sim:weight":0.377678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101214,"sim:weight":0.361784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5534611,"sim:weight":0.353758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.315579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.304739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.304736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643987,"sim:weight":0.28588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.279816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101347,"sim:weight":0.27658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631690,"sim:weight":0.273894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98860,"sim:weight":0.273156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":569093,"sim:weight":0.272429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1091349,"sim:weight":0.261967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.259402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1141658,"sim:weight":0.255501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.254134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.251129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631517,"sim:weight":0.250311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.250229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25871,"sim:weight":0.246121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Only English language papers were selected. Editorials, letters and case reports/series were excluded. The reference sections of all retrieved articles were also searched for any further relevant articles. \r\nResults  \r\nForty articles were identified. Five RCT and six ‘before and after\u0027 studies were retrieved. In the RCTs, three studies used computer-based CDSS, one paper-based CDSS and one a combination of both. Two studies were conducted in primary care and three within secondary care. The primary outcomes for each study were different and only three studies were significant in the favour of the use of CDSS. ‘Before and after\u0027 studies were used where RCT were not feasible. One ‘before and after\u0027 study was excluded because it did not include any control group. The remaining five included historical control groups and evaluated the use of computer-based CDSS within secondary care. Their primary outcomes also varied but all concluded significant benefits of CDSS. Only three of ten studies were conducted outside the USA; one in Switzerland and two in Australia. \r\nConclusion  \r\nCDSS could be a powerful tool to improve clinical care and patient outcomes. It presents a promising future for optimising antibiotic use. However, it is difficult to generalise as most studies were conducted in the United States. Although RCT are the ‘gold standard\u0027 in research, they may not be feasible to conduct. Realising that different study designs answer different questions would allow researchers to choose the most appropriate study design to evaluate CDSS in a specified setting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shebl, N.A.","Franklin, B.D.","Barber, N."],"dc:date":"2007-08","doi":"10.1007/s11096-007-9113-3.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":57701,"sim:weight":0.547717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11157,"sim:weight":0.528574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65377,"sim:weight":0.525371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55751,"sim:weight":0.519173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5224633,"sim:weight":0.49519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24852,"sim:weight":0.480504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10043,"sim:weight":0.480354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.462902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.451419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.451419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105299,"sim:weight":0.447301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45439,"sim:weight":0.424348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24382,"sim:weight":0.393733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2632,"sim:weight":0.365393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25874,"sim:weight":0.3223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75704,"sim:weight":0.318605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25871,"sim:weight":0.304219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42189,"sim:weight":0.295408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.272081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24399,"sim:weight":0.247182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this paper, we investigate the relative contribution of microparticle and drug properties, specifically microsphere size and drug\u0027s molecular weight and acid solubility, on the extent of such undesired release. A series of nine drugs with different physicochemical properties were successfully encapsulated into Eudragit S and Eudragit L microparticles using a novel emulsion solvent evaporation process. The process yielded spherical microparticles with a narrow size distribution (27-60 and 36-56 µm for Eudragit L and Eudragit S microparticles, respectively). Upon incubation in acid medium (pH 1.2) for 2 h, the release of dipyridamole, cinnarizine, amprenavir, bendroflumethiazide, budesonide and prednisolone from both Eudragit microparticles was less than 10% of drug load and conformed with the USP specifications for enteric dosage forms. In contrast, more than 10% of the entrapped paracetamol, salicylic acid and ketoprofen were released. Multiple regression revealed that the drug\u0027s molecular weight was the most important factor that determined its extent of release in the acid medium, while its acid solubility and microsphere\u0027s size had minor influences.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alhnan, M.A.","Cosi, D.","Murdan, S.","Basit, A.W."],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1002/jps.22174","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1442675,"sim:weight":0.66585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":773231,"sim:weight":0.571194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1107512,"sim:weight":0.491864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.343428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340647,"sim:weight":0.290027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930758,"sim:weight":0.265169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654725,"sim:weight":0.262158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584831,"sim:weight":0.199087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98848,"sim:weight":0.196178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387350,"sim:weight":0.194993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.179249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17921,"sim:weight":0.173856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98988,"sim:weight":0.166028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76604,"sim:weight":0.145208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145983,"sim:weight":0.142695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387341,"sim:weight":0.139894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101526,"sim:weight":0.139166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98452,"sim:weight":0.134915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18064,"sim:weight":0.134303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.131521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) - a skin irritant - is often included in the coupling medium at 1% (w/v), as this has been found to enhance skin permeability. In this paper we show, for the first time, the feasibility of low-frequency ultrasound-assisted transcutaneous immunisation in the absence of SDS. Antibody titres were strongly influenced by experimental conditions. SDS presence in the coupling medium increased antibody titres, though a lower concentration of 0.5% (w/v) generated much higher titres than the commonly used 1% (w/v), despite causing less skin damage. A lower ultrasound duty cycle of 10% generated higher antibody titres than a duty cycle of 20%, also despite causing lower skin damage. Such lack of correlation between skin damage and immune responses indicates that enhancement of skin permeability to topically applied antigen (as indicated by changes in skin integrity) was not the main mechanism of low-frequency ultrasound-assisted skin immunisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dahlan, A.","Alpar, H.O.","Stickings, P.","Sesardic, D.","Murdan, S."],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1016/j.ijpharm.2008.10.014.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.235133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.226551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101519,"sim:weight":0.226255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631669,"sim:weight":0.225772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26480,"sim:weight":0.223885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.207025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222891,"sim:weight":0.201721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.201693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.197871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.1957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.19417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.193953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.193235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631690,"sim:weight":0.188868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382885,"sim:weight":0.188755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387237,"sim:weight":0.18472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387108,"sim:weight":0.184715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.176258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75818,"sim:weight":0.175732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.172487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The present study aimed to identify key physicochemical properties influencing the interaction of a series of PBDs (four dimers and 12 monomers) with the three major human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (P-gp, ABCG2, and MRP1). Isogenic cell lines expressing P-gp and ABCG2, cell lines with acquired resistance to cytotoxic agents due to the high expression of ABC transporters, and specific inhibitors against P-gp, ABCG2, and MRP1 were used. P-gp and ABCG2 decreased the permeability of the PBD dimers across cell membranes and their interaction with DNA, reducing DNA damage and the overall cytotoxic effect. PBD monomer SG-2823 formed a conjugate with glutathione and interacted with MRP1, reducing its cytotoxic effect in A549 cells. Structure–activity relationship revealed that the interaction of PBDs with the transporters could be predicted considering the molecular weight, the lipophilicity, the number of (N + O) atoms and aromatic rings, the polar surface area, the hydrogen bonding energy, and electrophilic centers.

Biophysical and biochemical studies of SJG-136 have shown a remarkable affinity for DNA and potent cytotoxicity in vitro. On this basis, together with its unique sequence selectivity and interstrand DNA cross-linking activity, SJG-136 has been selected for clinical trials. This study examines the pharmacological characteristics of SJG-136 and provides the first report of pharmacokinetic properties for this agent. A sensitive, selective and reproducible reversed-phase gradient LC/MS assay has been developed for detection and analysis, where a molecular ion (m/z 557.2) is detectable for the SJG-136 parent imine. Fluorescence detection (260 nm excitation, 420 nm emission) gives a limit of sensitivity of 5 nM (2.5 ng ml–1) for analysis of SJG-136 in mouse plasma. Extraction efficiencies from plasma were \u003e65% across a range of concentrations (5–1000 nM). Following administration to mice at the MTD (i.p., 0.2 mg kg–1), high peak plasma concentrations of SJG-136 were seen (C max \u003d 336 nM) at 30 min after dosing. A calculated terminal t 1/2 of 0.98 h and AUC of 0.34 M·h resulted in a clearance rate of 17.7 ml min–1 kg–1. The PBD dimer binds only moderately to proteins (65–75%), and in vitro cytotoxicity studies confirmed IC50 values of 4–30 nM with a panel of human cell lines.

Micro/macroporous PCL vascular grafts (5.5 mm internal diameter, 7.5 mm external diameter) with defined macropore structures were produced by rapidly cooling PCL solutions containing dispersed gelatin particles in dry ice, followed by solvent and gelatin extraction. A Bose-Enduratec BioDynamic chamber configured for cardiovascular applications was used to measure the diametrical stability (dilation) of tubular samples under hydrodynamic flow conditions at 37 °C. Microporous PCL tubes withstood the hydrodynamic stresses induced by short, 2-min duration flow rates up to 1000 mL/min, which resulted in estimated internal pressures in excess of arterial pressure (80–130 mmHg). Micro/macroporous PCL tubes having a maximum macroporosity of 23% accommodated the hydrodynamic stresses generated by short duration, flow rates up to 1000 mL/min, which resulted in estimated internal pressures similar to venous pressure (30 mmHg).The dilation of microporous PCL tubes under short, (5 min) pulsatile flow conditions (1 Hz) increased from 10 to 100 μm with increasing mean flow rate from 50 to 500 mL/min. Both microporous and macroporous tubes exhibited a burst strength higher than 900 mmHg under hydrostatic fluid pressure, which is in excess of arterial pressure (80–130 mmHg) by a factor of approximately 7. Quantitative analysis of the macropore structure was performed using micro-computed tomography for correlation with mechanical properties and cell growth rates. Mouse fibroblasts efficiently colonized the external surface of macroporous PCL materials over 8 days in cell culture and cell numbers were higher by a factor of two compared with microporous PCL. These findings demonstrate that micro/macroporous PCL tubes designed for vascular tissue engineering can accommodate the hydrodynamic stresses generated by short duration, simulated blood flow conditions and exhibit good potential for integration with host tissue.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Y.","Lam, J.","Zhang, B.","Tomlins, P.E.","Li, X.","Alpar, H.O.","Wertheim, D.F.","Jones, A.S.","Coombes, A.G.A."],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1007/s13239-010-0019-1.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98988,"sim:weight":0.427944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020655,"sim:weight":0.281285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17919,"sim:weight":0.236548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":551939,"sim:weight":0.233752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632012,"sim:weight":0.220357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383986,"sim:weight":0.218606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98984,"sim:weight":0.203679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98474,"sim:weight":0.193312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146047,"sim:weight":0.188316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43460,"sim:weight":0.182206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43211,"sim:weight":0.18097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17921,"sim:weight":0.179075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99391,"sim:weight":0.168914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98849,"sim:weight":0.164959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98589,"sim:weight":0.164788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.162506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.160483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.15948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76604,"sim:weight":0.157709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98959,"sim:weight":0.155764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this study, we explore the combined use of Poisson–Boltzmann electrostatic calculations and evaluation of van der Waals interactions between ion and pore to provide an initial appraisal of the gating state of a channel. This approach is exemplified by its application to the bacterial inward rectifier potassium channel KirBac3.1, where it reveals the closed gate to be formed by a ring of leucine (L124) side chains. We have extended this analysis to a comparative survey of gating profiles, including model hydrophobic nanopores, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and a number of potassium channel structures and models. This enables us to identify three gating regimes, and to show the limitation of this computationally inexpensive method. For a (closed) gate radius of 0.4 nm \u003c R \u003c 0.8 nm, a hydrophobic gate may be present. For a gate radius of 0.2 nm \u003c R \u003c 0.4 nm, both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions will contribute to the barrier height. Below R \u003d 0.2 nm, repulsive van der Waals interactions are likely to dominate, resulting in a sterically occluded gate. In general, the method is more useful when the channel is wider; for narrower channels, the flexibility of the protein may allow otherwise-unsurmountable energetic barriers to be overcome.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tai, K.","Haider, S.M.","Grottesi, A.","Sansom, M.S.P."],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1007/s00249-008-0377-x.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269867,"sim:weight":0.386197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.319544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710180,"sim:weight":0.257874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387283,"sim:weight":0.257607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.251466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.239198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.23519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44193,"sim:weight":0.22332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98875,"sim:weight":0.222659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23297,"sim:weight":0.220758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.220062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.216474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.216474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47658,"sim:weight":0.215147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.213584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387245,"sim:weight":0.213088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.211801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.211036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.207503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332856,"sim:weight":0.206462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Amorphous trehalose is known to stabilize biomaterials; hence, an understanding of crystallization is vital. Amorphous trehalose, prepared by spray-drying, was exposed to either a single step (0–75%) in relative humidity (RH) or to modulated 0–75–0% RH to cause crystallization. For the single-step experiment, two samples crystallized in a predictable manner to form the dihydrate. One sample, while notionally identical, did not crystallize in the same way and showed a mass loss throughout the time at 75% RH, with a final mass less than that expected for the dihydrate. The idiosyncratic sample was seen to have a starting near infrared (NIR) spectra similar to that exhibited by anhydrous crystalline trehalose, implying that short-range order in the amorphous material (or a small amount of crystalline seed, not detectable using powder X-ray diffraction) caused the sample to fail to form the dihydrate fully when exposed to high RH. The modulated RH study showed that the amorphous material interacted strongly with water; the intensity of the NIR traces was not proportional to mass of water but rather the extent of hydrogen bonding. Subsequent crystallization of this sample clearly was a partial formation of the dihydrate, but with the bulk of the sample then shielded such that it was unable to show significant sorption when exposed to elevated RH. It has been shown that the nature of the amorphous form will alter the way in which samples crystallize. With oscillation in RH, it was possible to further understand the interactions between water and amorphous trehalose.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moran, A.","Buckton, G."],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1208/s12249-009-9195-4.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8794498,"sim:weight":0.386572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.244909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54196,"sim:weight":0.218091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.207148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795349,"sim:weight":0.204375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99102,"sim:weight":0.201993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108521,"sim:weight":0.195481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387364,"sim:weight":0.194908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.191063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46771,"sim:weight":0.190382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98837,"sim:weight":0.189519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.186254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99464,"sim:weight":0.185193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.183894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.180822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98490,"sim:weight":0.178887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631546,"sim:weight":0.175378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108054,"sim:weight":0.17468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.170792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.169752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To assess the effect of polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), a pharmaceutical excipient frequently employed to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs, on the gastrointestinal transit of liquid and pellet preparations in human subjects using gamma scintigraphy.\r\nMethods. Ten, healthy male volunteers each received, on separate occasions, a liquid preparation consisting of 150 ml orange juice (control) or 150 ml orange juice containing 10 g PEG 400 (test). Non-disintegrating pellets of size 1.4-1.7 mm, encapsulated within a hard gelatin capsule, were simultaneously administered on both occasions to act as a marker for solid dosage form transit. The liquid and pellet preparations were radiolabelled with 111In and 99mTc respectively thus enabling their positions within the gastrointestinal tract to be followed using a gamma camera.\r\nResults. Rapid liquid emptying from the stomach was observed, with no significant difference noted in the gastric residence times of the two preparations. Caecum arrival times for the liquid preparations were significantly different by virtue of their differential rates of transit through the small intestine. The mean small intestinal liquid transit time for the control preparation was 236 min whereas the corresponding value for the PEG 400-containing test preparation was 153 min. This 35% reduction in transit time was attributed to the presence of PEG 400. Pellet transit was largely unaffected by the presence of PEG 400.\r\nConclusions. These findings clearly demonstrate that PEG 400 has a marked accelerating effect on small intestinal liquid transit, which in turn has implications for the formulation of poorly water-soluble drugs with PEG 400.","bibo:AuthorList":["Basit, A.W.","Newton, J.M.","Short, M.D.","Waddington , W.A.","Ell, P.J.","Lacey, L.F."],"dc:date":"2001","doi":"10.1023/A","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99711,"sim:weight":0.681296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113341,"sim:weight":0.54135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99238,"sim:weight":0.32108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780062,"sim:weight":0.241548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.228998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98568,"sim:weight":0.224315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.223387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98841,"sim:weight":0.222482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.21717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387356,"sim:weight":0.211876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.20528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.20528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.20528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.20528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.20528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.20528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.20528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.20528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.20528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.20528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, little is known about the overall importance of CAM in groups of health care professionals. Therefore, the primary objective was to analyse the knowledge about and use of CAM in an ethnically diverse student population at the London School of Pharmacy. Methods: A questionnaire was administered to students (264 completed questionnaires, response rate: 59.1%) and in-depth interviews were carried out with a sample of seven students. Results: Forty-three percent reported using at least one type of CAM during the last 12 months. The types of CAM used that were most frequently mentioned include aromatherapy, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and medicinal herbalism. TCM was reported by students of Chinese origin and by students from other ethnic backgrounds. However, Ayurvedic (Indian) medicine and medicine from Africa were only used in cultures from which the users originated. The study shows that a large number of herbal medical products were commonly reported by students of pharmacy. Conclusion The knowledge about and use of CAM is widespread among this group of future health care professionals and the students also expressed a strong interest in the topic. In-depth studies on the knowledge and use of CAM among other health care professionals and among ethnic minorities are urgently needed and may help to better manage the treatment of minor disorders as well as chronic diseases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Freymann, H.","Rennie, T.","Bates, I.","Nebel, S.","Heinrich, M."],"dc:date":"2006","doi":"10.1007/s11096-005-2221-z.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.363461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664920,"sim:weight":0.357066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.351932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.351782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.317108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.30823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.308131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Consequently, dispersion of omeprazole in water may be an inappropriate formulation in this setting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tuleu, C.","Arenas-Lopez, S.","Robinson, C.","McCarthy, D.","Paget, R.I.J.","Tibby, S.","Taylor, K.M.G."],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1007/s00431-007-0567-z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.172068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.160438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.159562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99386,"sim:weight":0.158206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.15811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145923,"sim:weight":0.154173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99600,"sim:weight":0.152128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146010,"sim:weight":0.15174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387892,"sim:weight":0.148047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.147443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98568,"sim:weight":0.146541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.14065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.139684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.139684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.138078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.133035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385794,"sim:weight":0.132628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.129459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177092,"sim:weight":0.127778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761116,"sim:weight":0.12776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Experimental analysis of these glycosylated dendrimers showed that, on average, eight glucosamine molecules were covalently bound to each dendrimer. In order to better understand the surface loading and distribution of these glucosamine molecules, molecular reactivity was determined by evaluation of electronic properties using frontier molecular orbital theory (FMOT) and molecular dynamics simulations. It was shown that the surface loading and distribution of zero length amide bond-conjugated glucosamine molecules was determined by both electronic effects and by the different dynamic conformations adopted by the modified dendrimer during the incremental addition of glucosamine. Importantly, the structural features and the dynamic behavior of the partially glycosylated generation 3.5 PAMAM dendrimer showed that its flexibility and polarity changed with the incremental addition of glucosamine. These peripheral glucosamine molecules remained available on the dendrimer’s surface for interaction with the biological target.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barata, T.S.","Shaunak, S.","Teo, I.","Zloh, M.","Brocchini, S."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1007/s00894-010-0907-1.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":112994,"sim:weight":0.647355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98539,"sim:weight":0.376908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84820,"sim:weight":0.232204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387283,"sim:weight":0.172459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710180,"sim:weight":0.16293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47658,"sim:weight":0.160824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12333,"sim:weight":0.1604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23297,"sim:weight":0.156133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271098,"sim:weight":0.154349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86239,"sim:weight":0.147057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.139509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108077,"sim:weight":0.138864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.13862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387413,"sim:weight":0.134668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43026,"sim:weight":0.132621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.130628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.130563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.12863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43269,"sim:weight":0.125899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85213,"sim:weight":0.125805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The cumulative amount of ranitidine and its metabolites excreted in urine over 24 h was determined for each treatment using a validated HPLC method. \r\nResults  \r\nIn the male volunteers, the mean cumulative amount of ranitidine excreted in the presence of 0, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25 and 1.5 g PEG 400 were 35, 47, 57, 52, 50 and 37 mg respectively. These correspond to increases in bioavailability of 34%, 63%, 49%, 43% and 6% over the control treatment. In the female subjects, the mean cumulative quantity of ranitidine excretion in the absence and presence of increasing amounts of PEG 400 were 38, 29, 35, 33, 33 and 33 mg, corresponding to decreases in bioavailability of 24%, 8%, 13%, 13% and 13% compared to the control. The metabolite excretion profiles followed a similar trend to the parent drug at all concentrations of PEG 400. \r\nConclusions  \r\nAll doses of PEG 400 enhanced the bioavailability of ranitidine in male subjects but not females, with the most pronounced effect in males noted with the 0.75 g dose of PEG 400 (63% increase in bioavailability compared to control, p \u003c 0.05).

Amylose, in the form of an amylose-butan-1-ol dispersion, and ethylcellulose, dissolved in either ethyl lactate, ethanol, or propanol and plasticized with dibutyl sebacate, were mixed in various proportions and applied using a fluidized bed coater to achieve a range of film thicknesses on 5-aminosalicylic acid pellets. Drug release from the coated pellets was assessed under gastric and small intestinal conditions in the presence and absence of pepsin and pancreatin using dissolution methodology, and also within a simulated colonic environment involving fermentation testing with human feces in the form of a slurry. Under upper gastrointestinal tract conditions, the rate and extent of drug release were found to be related to the thickness of the coating and the ratio of amylose to ethylcellulose within the film. Modeling of the drug release data revealed that the ratio was more important than coat thickness in controlling drug release, irrespective of the solvent used for coating. Coatings with a thick film and/or low amylose content were relatively impermeable and able to delay drug release under conditions mimicking the upper gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, drug release was unaffected by the presence of pepsin and pancreatin and by long-term storage. Under simulated colonic conditions, drug release was more pronounced from coating formulations containing higher proportions of amylose. Colon-specificity can therefore be achieved using such systems by judicious choice of the appropriate ratio of amylose to ethylcellulose and coat thickness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Siew, L.F.","Basit, A.W.","Newton, J.M."],"dc:date":"2000","doi":"10.1208/pt010322","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":111780,"sim:weight":0.810447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58629,"sim:weight":0.242763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222955,"sim:weight":0.227724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.202498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.187688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381916,"sim:weight":0.180541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99464,"sim:weight":0.173993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.170691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99449,"sim:weight":0.169735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930758,"sim:weight":0.167256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780062,"sim:weight":0.164673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101231,"sim:weight":0.162323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.156551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99455,"sim:weight":0.154553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75333,"sim:weight":0.154219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.153658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43802,"sim:weight":0.149899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631076,"sim:weight":0.14022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316479,"sim:weight":0.140198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.138604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To investigate the effect of co-administered polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), a pharmaceutical excipient previously shown to accelerate small intestinal transit, on the absorption characteristics of ranitidine from the gastrointestinal tract.\r\nMethods. Ten healthy male volunteers each received, on two separate occasions, an immediate-release pellet formulation of ranitidine (150 mg) encapsulated within a hard gelatin capsule and a liquid preparation consisting of 150 ml orange juice (control) or 150 ml orange juice containing 10 g PEG 400 (test). The liquid preparations were also radiolabelled with indium-111 to allow their transit through the gastrointestinal tract to be followed using a gamma camera. On a further occasion an intravenous injection of ranitidine (50 mg) was administered. Blood samples were taken over a 12 h period on each study day to allow a ranitidine plasma and subsequent absorption rate profile to be generated for each oral formulation. Urine was collected for 24 h and assessed for PEG 400 concentration.\r\nResults. The absolute bioavailability of ranitidine from the pellet formulation was significantly reduced by 31% (from 51% to 35%) and small intestinal liquid transit time was significantly shortened by 37% (from 226 min to 143 min) as a consequence of PEG 400 in the test preparation. PEG 400 also affected the rate of ranitidine absorption, with major differences noted in the mean absorption time and Cmax parameters. The appearance of double peaks were less evident in the ranitidine pharmacokinetic profiles in the presence of PEG 400, and little or no correlation was observed between the absorption of ranitidine and PEG 400.\r\nConclusions. These results clearly demonstrate that PEG 400 adversely influences the gastrointestinal absorption of ranitidine. This in turn has ramifications for the use of PEG 400 as a pharmaceutical excipient in oral formulations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Basit, A.W.","Podczeck, F.","Newton, J.M.","Waddington , W.A.","Ell, P.J.","Lacey, L.F."],"dc:date":"2002","doi":"10.1023/A","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99708,"sim:weight":0.799415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99704,"sim:weight":0.681296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1057389,"sim:weight":0.617995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99238,"sim:weight":0.34685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780062,"sim:weight":0.286268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761116,"sim:weight":0.274584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.250375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98568,"sim:weight":0.238731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.214424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.213676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.212996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.210275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.209331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.204068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.204068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.202678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98452,"sim:weight":0.201153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.201135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101526,"sim:weight":0.196512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99319,"sim:weight":0.194118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although changes in cell surface GABA(A) receptor number have been postulated to be of importance in modulating inhibitory synaptic transmission, little is currently known on the mechanism used by neurons to modify surface receptor levels at inhibitory synapses. To address this issue, we have studied the cell surface expression and maintenance of GABA(A) receptors. Here we show that constitutive internalization of GABA(A) receptors in hippocampal neurons and recombinant receptors expressed in A293 cells is mediated by clathrin- dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, we identify an interaction between the GABA(A) receptor beta and gamma subunits with the adaptin complex AP2, which is critical for the recruitment of integral membrane proteins into clathrin-coated pits. GABA(A) receptors also colocalize with AP2 in cultured hippocampal neurons. Finally, blocking clathrin-dependant endocytosis with a peptide that disrupts the association between amphiphysin and dynamin causes a large sustained increase in the amplitude of miniature IPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that GABA(A) receptors cycle between the synaptic membrane and intracellular sites, and their association with AP2 followed by recruitment into clathrin- coated pits represents an important mechanism in the postsynaptic modulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kittler, J.T.","Delmas, P.","Jovanovic, J.N.","Brown, D.A.","Smart, T.G.","Moss, S.J."],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103423,"sim:weight":0.565865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111777,"sim:weight":0.489652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113655,"sim:weight":0.420867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10819,"sim:weight":0.407782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.311076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631461,"sim:weight":0.242704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.228702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145468,"sim:weight":0.224688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.218812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111762,"sim:weight":0.20528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76961,"sim:weight":0.200607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.199284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.199276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.197899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773164,"sim:weight":0.197604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.19567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779642,"sim:weight":0.192768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3063,"sim:weight":0.191183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709942,"sim:weight":0.189294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.182527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using specific inhibitors, we have attempted to identify the channels that underlie these outward currents. At a holding potential of -50 mV, applications of 1 mM NMDA to the soma of cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons induced the expected inward currents. In 44% of cells tested, these were followed by outward currents (average amplitude 60 +/- 7 pA) that peaked 2.5 s after the initiation of the inward NMDA currents and decayed with a time constant of 1.4 s. In 43% of those cells exhibiting an outward current, SK channel inhibitors, UCL 1848 (100 nM) and apamin (100 nM) abolished the outward current. In the remainder of the cells, the outward currents were either insensitive or only partly inhibited (44 +/- 4%) by 100 nM UCL 1848. In these cells, the outward currents were reduced by the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) inhibitors, muscarine (3 microM; 43 +/- 9%), UCL 1880 (3 microM; 34 +/- 10%), and UCL 2027 (3 microM; 57 +/- 6%). Neither the BK channel inhibitor, charybdotoxin (100 nM), nor the Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor, ouabain (100 microM), reduced these outward currents. Irrespective of the pharmacology, the time course of the outward current did not differ. Interestingly, no correlation was observed between the presence of a slow apamin-insensitive afterhyperpolarization and an outward current insensitive to SK channel blockers following NMDA-receptor activation. It is concluded that an NMDA-mediated rise in [Ca2+]i can result in the activation of apamin-sensitive SK channels and of the channels that underlie the sAHP. The activation of these channels may, however, depend on their location relative to NMDA receptors as well as on the spatial Ca2+ buffering within individual neurons.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shah, M.M.","Haylett, D.G."],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99722,"sim:weight":0.469163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113571,"sim:weight":0.39876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22602,"sim:weight":0.370962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45442,"sim:weight":0.306388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81250,"sim:weight":0.299833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113396,"sim:weight":0.286856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113355,"sim:weight":0.286703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76477,"sim:weight":0.262551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111762,"sim:weight":0.260675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99159,"sim:weight":0.243953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387160,"sim:weight":0.236898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50198,"sim:weight":0.228815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.228367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43976,"sim:weight":0.219235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501129,"sim:weight":0.218966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631920,"sim:weight":0.216743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.215656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77510,"sim:weight":0.211777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584828,"sim:weight":0.211341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.201501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using perforated-patch recordings, both medium and slow afterhyperpolarization currents (mI(AHP) and sI(AHP), respectively) could be obtained from pyramidal cells that were cultured for 8-15 days. The sI(AHP) demonstrated the kinetics and pharmacologic characteristics reported for pyramidal cells in slices. In addition to confirming the insensitivity to 100 nM apamin and 1 mM TEA, we have shown that the sI(AHP) is also insensitive to 100 nM charybdotoxin but is inhibited by 100 microM D-tubocurarine. Concentrations of nifedipine (10 microM) and nimodipine (3 microM) that maximally inhibit L-type calcium channels reduced the sI(AHP) by 30 and 50%, respectively. However, higher concentrations of nimodipine (10 microM) abolished the sI(AHP), which can be partially explained by an effect on action potentials. Both nifedipine and nimodipine at maximal concentrations were found to reduce the HVA calcium current in freshly dissociated neurons to the same extent. The N-type calcium channel inhibitor, omega-conotoxin GVIA (100 nM), irreversibly inhibited the sI(AHP) by 37%. Together, omega-conotoxin (100 nM) and nifedipine (10 microM) inhibited the sI(AHP) by 70%. 10 microM ryanodine also reduced the sI(AHP) by 30%, suggesting a role for calcium-induced calcium release.

These receptors are hetero-pentamers that can be assembled from a number of subunit classes: alpha(1-6), beta(1-3), gamma(1-3), delta(1), epsilon, theta;, and pi, but the majority of receptor subtypes is believed, however, to be composed of alpha, beta, and gamma2 subunits. A major mechanism for modulating GABA(A) receptor function occurs via the phosphorylation of residues within the intracellular domains of receptor subunits by a range of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. However, how protein kinases are targeted to these receptors to facilitate functional modulation remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that the receptor for activated C kinase (RACK-1) and protein kinase C (PKC) bind to distinct sites on GABA(A) receptor beta subunits. Although RACK-1 is not essential for PKC binding to GABA(A) receptor beta subunits, it enhances the phosphorylation of serine 409, a residue critical for the phospho-dependent modulation of GABA(A) receptor function in the beta1 subunit by anchored PKC. Furthermore, RACK-1 also enhances GABA(A) receptor functional modulation in neurons by a PKC-dependent signaling pathway with the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). This PKC-dependent modulation of neuronal GABA(A) receptors was mirrored by an increase in the phosphorylation of GABA(A) receptor beta subunits with the activation of mAChRs. Our results suggest a central role for RACK-1 in potentiating PKC-dependent phosphorylation and functional modulation of GABA(A) receptors. Therefore, RACK-1 will enhance functional cross talk between GABA(A) receptors and G-protein-coupled receptors and therefore may have profound effects on neuronal excitability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brandon, N.J.","Jovanovic, J.N.","Smart, T.G.","Moss, S.J."],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":113655,"sim:weight":0.612147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99720,"sim:weight":0.565865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111777,"sim:weight":0.421895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.31032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394492,"sim:weight":0.233159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.230179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76961,"sim:weight":0.228301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773164,"sim:weight":0.217659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.216417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.215922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.208828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.206014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184423,"sim:weight":0.200809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631653,"sim:weight":0.194572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98668,"sim:weight":0.192039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.188668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.188267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.186977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.185793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.184001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Injection of in vitro-transcribed RNA from this clone into Xenopus laevis oocytes results in the robust expression of homo-oligomeric cation channels that can be gated by L-glutamate (EC50 \u003d 1.2 +/- 0.3 micron) and several other glutamate receptor agonists; rank order of potency: glutamate \u003e\u003e kainate \u003e ibotenate \u003e AMPA. These currents can be blocked by the mammalian non-NMDA receptor antagonists 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, and 1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid. Ionic-replacement experiments have shown that the agonist-induced current is carried entirely by sodium and potassium ions. In situ hybridization has revealed that the Lym-eGluR2 transcript is present in all 11 ganglia of the Lymnaea CNS, including the 4-cluster motorneurons within the paired buccal ganglia.

Bisphosphonates were the most common type of bone loss treatment prescribed in the 12 months preceding the study. \r\nConclusions  \r\nPOSSIBLE EU® characterises postmenopausal women with low bone mass, exhibiting a high rate of prevalent fracture, substantial bone fragility and overall comorbidity burden. Clinical strategies for managing osteoporosis in this population varied across the five participating European countries, reflecting their different guidelines, regulations and standards of care.","bibo:AuthorList":["Freemantle, N.","Cooper, C.","Roux, C.","Díez-Pérez, A.","Guillemin, F.","Jonsson, B.","Ortolani, S.","Pfeilschifter, J.","Horne, R.","Kakad, S.","Shepherd, S.","Möller, G.","Marciniak, A.","Martinez, L."],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1007/s11657-010-0035-7.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67048,"sim:weight":0.792905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.779762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83543,"sim:weight":0.669311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55615,"sim:weight":0.65491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930274,"sim:weight":0.647685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932897,"sim:weight":0.643454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88588,"sim:weight":0.642278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931404,"sim:weight":0.639746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932633,"sim:weight":0.638689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82286,"sim:weight":0.630918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997452,"sim:weight":0.629245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9597628,"sim:weight":0.627955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55965,"sim:weight":0.623924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82309,"sim:weight":0.618351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54840,"sim:weight":0.612749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83068,"sim:weight":0.610512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83113,"sim:weight":0.609683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933327,"sim:weight":0.60874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82282,"sim:weight":0.605168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82308,"sim:weight":0.603547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The current study examines complex formation between efflux pump substrates and escort molecules as a criterion for an in silico screening method for molecules that are able to potentiate antibiotic activities. Initially, the SUPERDRUG database was queried to select molecules that were similar to known multidrug resistance (MDR) modulators. Molecular interaction fields generated by GRID and the docking module GLUE were used to calculate the interaction energies between the selected molecules and the antibiotic norfloxacin. Ten compounds forming the most stable complexes with favourable changes to the norfloxacin molecular properties were tested for their potentiation ability by efflux pump modulation assays. Encouragingly, two molecules were proven to act as efflux pump modulators, and hence provide evidence that complex formation between a substrate and a drug can be used for in silico screening for novel escort molecules.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rahman, S.S.","Simovic, I.","Gibbons, S.","Zloh, M."],"dc:date":"2011-11","doi":"10.1007/s00894-011-0978-7.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85118,"sim:weight":0.329609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47658,"sim:weight":0.291073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101542,"sim:weight":0.281745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.278979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99485,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.242527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337951,"sim:weight":0.235864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.229748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.229549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.229194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43618,"sim:weight":0.222119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.221053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.221053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.221053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.221053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.221053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.221053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.221053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.221053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.221053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with ADRs in hospitalised children and recommend strategies to minimise ADRs. \r\nMethods  \r\nA prospective multicentre cohort study was conducted on paediatric general medical wards in five European and non-European hospitals. ADRs were identified by intensive chart review. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate risk factors associated with ADRs. For the risk factor analysis, prescribed drugs were divided into high-risk and low-risk drug groups. Analgesics, anti-epileptics, antibacterials and antimycotics for systemic use, corticosteroids for systemic use and immunosuppressant agents were considered as high-risk groups whereas the remaining drug classes were defined as low-risk drug groups. \r\nResults  \r\nA total of 1,253 paediatric patients were identified [Australia (n \u003d 145), Germany (n \u003d 372), Hong Kong (n \u003d 138), Malaysia (n \u003d 291), UK (n \u003d 307)]. A total of 328 ADRs were observed in 16.7% of patients (186/1,115). Use of five or more low-risk drugs per patient or  three or more high-risk drugs was a strong predictor for ADRs (OR 4.7, 95% CI 2.4–9.3; OR 6.5, 95% CI 2.7–16.0 respectively; p \u003c 0.001). Older children were more likely to experience ADRs; gender was not significantly associated. \r\nConclusion  \r\nTo reduce the risk of ADRs in children, clinicians and pharmacists should aim to minimise polypharmacy and be aware of higher ADR risks associated with some drug groups.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rashed, A.N.","Wong, I.C.K.","Cranswick, N.","Tomlin, S.","Rascher, W.","Neubert, A.C."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1007/s00228-011-1183-4.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4182214,"sim:weight":0.4467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":381698,"sim:weight":0.434483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99386,"sim:weight":0.374338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185982,"sim:weight":0.307025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631868,"sim:weight":0.297858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.287668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.286952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.268707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.262858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99600,"sim:weight":0.262472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585628,"sim:weight":0.253883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77264,"sim:weight":0.245903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8747712,"sim:weight":0.243421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.241489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.228261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.214658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.213406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101310,"sim:weight":0.208983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.197884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24375,"sim:weight":0.187272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Bacteriophage-derived endosialidase E (endoE) selectively degrades the PSA capsule on the surface of E. coli K1 strains. Intraperitoneal administration of small quantities of recombinant endoE (20 μg) to 3-day-old rats, colonized with a virulent strain of K1, prevented bacteremia and death from systemic infection.

A wide range of presynaptic mechanisms, some that depress the release of transmitter and others that enhance release have been identified. It is the selective expression of these different mechanisms that determines the unique frequency- and pattern-dependent properties of each class of connection. Although the molecular interactions underlying these several mechanisms have yet to be fully identified, the wealth and complexity of the protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions that have been shown to control the release of transmitter suggest many ways in which the properties of a synapse may be tuned to respond to particular patterns and frequencies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thomson, A.M."],"dc:date":"2003","doi":"10.1023/A","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85386,"sim:weight":0.562395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113396,"sim:weight":0.471304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85384,"sim:weight":0.417932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99516,"sim:weight":0.408869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44221,"sim:weight":0.39621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99522,"sim:weight":0.391807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1148009,"sim:weight":0.388538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113385,"sim:weight":0.383407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769000,"sim:weight":0.378547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99719,"sim:weight":0.368461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85649,"sim:weight":0.355973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46966,"sim:weight":0.34638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76477,"sim:weight":0.338504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384,"sim:weight":0.338136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3063,"sim:weight":0.331639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177222,"sim:weight":0.313227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145863,"sim:weight":0.300808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384013,"sim:weight":0.295306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.293725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584828,"sim:weight":0.288866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Methods The self-regulatory model (SRM) theory was used to guide development of our intervention and used in training pharmacists to adopt a patient-centred approach. Non-adherence to new medicines for chronic conditions develops rapidly so we developed a study intervention in which a pharmacist telephoned patients two weeks after they had started a new medicine for a chronic condition. Patients were included if they were 75 or older, or were suffering from stroke, cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis, and were randomized into treatment or control arms. Main outcome measures were non-adherence and cost to the UK NHS, obtained via a questionnaire sent two months after starting therapy. Cost of the intervention was also included. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were generated. Results Five hundred patients were recruited. At 4-week follow-up, non-adherence was significantly lower in the intervention group (9% vs 16%, p \u003d 0.032). The number of patients reporting medicine-related problems was significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control, (23% vs 34% p \u003d 0.021). Mean total patient costs at 2-month follow-up (median, range) were intervention: £187.7 (40.6, 4.2–2484.3); control: £282.8 (42, 0–3804) (p \u003c 0.0001). The intervention was dominant (less costly and more effective). If the decision maker is not willing to pay anything for one extra adherent patient, there is still a 90% probability that the intervention is cost effective. Conclusions These findings suggest that pharmacists can meet patients’ needs for information and advice on medicines, soon after starting treatment. While a larger trial is needed to confirm that the effect is real and sustained, these initial findings suggest the study intervention may be effective, at least in the short term, with a reduced overall cost to the health provider.","bibo:AuthorList":["Elliott, R.A.","Barber, N.","Clifford, S.","Horne, R."],"dc:date":"2008-01","doi":"10.1007/s11096-007-9134-y.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Neuronal cell death might be one of the crucial mediators of these diseases. The transcription factor NF-kappaB is well-known for its roles in preventing apoptotic cell death. Data indicated that NF-kappaB activation by pre-conditioning is part of a general brain tolerance program. Here we show that pre-conditioning leading to NF-kappaB activation also protects against oxidative insults generated by Fe2+ ions. Protection was accompanied by a long-lasting (more than 24 h) NF-kappaB activation. Using this paradigm of oxidative insult, we analyzed the effect of hypericin, one of the active principles of St. John\u0027s Wort. Hypericin alone was able to induce short-time activation of NF-kappaB, which declined to basal levels after 24 h. Cell death was induced by hypericin at a concentration of 10 microM. A profound synergistic action in inducing apoptosis was detected in co-treatment of hypericin together with FeSO4. In contrast, hypericin in low concentrations was able to partly prevent cell death induced by amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta). Hypericin (10 microM) synergistically enhanced Abeta neurotoxicity. Since hypericin is a described inhibitor of protein kinase C, we compared its action to staurosporine, another natural neuronal death-promoting PKC inhibitor. Staurosporine induced cell death and activates NF-kappaB. Molecular inhibition of NF-kappaB activation with a transdominant negative IkappaB-alpha protected against staurosporine-induced cell death. In summary, the data describe NF-kappaB in the same primary neuronal culture as stimulus-dependent, anti-apoptotic, or pro-apoptotic factor.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kaltschmidt, B.","Heinrich, M.","Kaltschmidt, C."],"dc:date":"2002","doi":"10.1385/NMM","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1632033,"sim:weight":0.317544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146196,"sim:weight":0.278287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107063,"sim:weight":0.256207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99258,"sim:weight":0.245742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.237123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631895,"sim:weight":0.218463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222897,"sim:weight":0.210408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.208378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.201632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76866,"sim:weight":0.193181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.19161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98535,"sim:weight":0.177225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501129,"sim:weight":0.176906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4881258,"sim:weight":0.176474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.174097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.169531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779642,"sim:weight":0.169077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.165479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222884,"sim:weight":0.163605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76122,"sim:weight":0.163506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Ethylcellulose is present in the system as a structuring agent in the form of the aqueous dispersion Surelease® grade EA-7100. There are, however, two other grades of Surelease® (E-7-7050 and E-7-19010), which vary slightly in terms of their composition. The aim of the study was to establish whether these grades differ in their drug release profiles, when used as a film coat, either as one-component coatings, or in combination with amylose. The dissolution profiles of Surelease® coated pellets were investigated and it was found that there was no difference between the grades when used as coating materials on their own. However, when used in combination with amylose, it was found that grade EA-7100 showed retardation of drug release in simulated upper gastro-intestinal (GI) conditions, whereas grades E-7-7050 and E-7-19010 did not limit the release to the same extent. E-7-19010 showed very poor controlled release properties when combined with amylose. These differences could not be attributed to the minimum film forming temperature (MFT) of the coating formulation, which was found to be independent of the grade of Surelease®. It was also confirmed that the film coated pellets prepared from amylose and EA-7100 showed good release in human faecal slurry, i.e. simulated colonic conditions. It was concluded that the grades of Surelease®, when combined with amylose, are not interchangeable.","bibo:AuthorList":["McConnell, E.L.","Tutas, J.","Mohamed, M.A.","Banning, D.","Basit, A.W."],"dc:date":"2007","doi":"10.1007/s10570-006-9078-8","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99710,"sim:weight":0.810447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1023226,"sim:weight":0.430848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":759372,"sim:weight":0.398928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":741168,"sim:weight":0.34398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.320459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222955,"sim:weight":0.31471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.256614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18064,"sim:weight":0.247872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99455,"sim:weight":0.24058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75333,"sim:weight":0.239904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930758,"sim:weight":0.237531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632012,"sim:weight":0.237076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780062,"sim:weight":0.236891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381916,"sim:weight":0.227075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.224413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631076,"sim:weight":0.22148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.215092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.211733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.211733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890299,"sim:weight":0.211592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Molecular genetic studies have determined that mutations in the genes encoding the postsynaptic glycine receptor (GlyR) α1 and β subunits (GLRA1 and GLRB) and the presynaptic glycine transporter GlyT2 (SLC6A5) are the major cause of these disorders. Here, we report the first genetically confirmed canine cases of startle disease. A litter of seven Irish wolfhounds was identified in which two puppies developed muscle stiffness and tremor in response to handling. Although sequencing of GLRA1 and GLRB did not reveal any pathogenic mutations, analysis of SLC6A5 revealed a homozygous 4.2kb microdeletion encompassing exons 2 and 3 in both affected animals. This results in the loss of part of the large cytoplasmic N-terminus and all subsequent transmembrane domains due to a frameshift. This genetic lesion was confirmed by defining the deletion breakpoint, Southern blotting, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). This analysis enabled the development of a rapid genotyping test that revealed heterozygosity for the deletion in the dam and sire and three other siblings, confirming recessive inheritance. Wider testing of related animals has identified a total of 13 carriers of the SLC6A5 deletion as well as non-carrier animals. These findings will inform future breeding strategies and enable a rational pharmacotherapy of this new canine disorder.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gill, J.L.","Capper, D.","Vanbellinghen, J-F.","Chung, S-K.","Higgins, R.J.","Rees, M.I.","Shelton, G.D.","Harvey, R.J."],"dc:date":"2011-07-25","doi":"10.1016/j.nbd.2011.03.010.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99671,"sim:weight":0.548804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111796,"sim:weight":0.516595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111782,"sim:weight":0.424032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111795,"sim:weight":0.3889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.378097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99672,"sim:weight":0.369568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.35598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.306867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.259327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98535,"sim:weight":0.258078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.257002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632025,"sim:weight":0.249883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.234879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710687,"sim:weight":0.234722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.234652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.234115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98501,"sim:weight":0.232281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.232026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99402,"sim:weight":0.231237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98536,"sim:weight":0.22382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This disorder is primarily caused by inherited mutations in the genes encoding the glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha1 subunit (GLRA1) and the presynaptic glycine transporter GlyT2 (SLC6A5). In this study, systematic DNA sequencing of GLRA1 in 88 new unrelated human hyperekplexia patients revealed 19 sequence variants in 30 index cases, of which 21 cases were inherited in recessive or compound heterozygote modes. This indicates that recessive hyperekplexia is far more prevalent than previous estimates. From the 19 GLRA1 sequence variants, we have investigated the functional effects of 11 novel and 2 recurrent mutations. The expression levels and functional properties of these hyperekplexia mutants were analyzed using a high-content imaging system and patch-clamp electrophysiology. When expressed in HEK293 cells, either as homomeric alpha1 or heteromeric alpha1beta GlyRs, subcellular localization defects were the major mechanism underlying recessive mutations. However, mutants without trafficking defects typically showed alterations in the glycine sensitivity suggestive of disrupted receptor function. This study also reports the first hyperekplexia mutation associated with a GlyR leak conductance, suggesting tonic channel opening as a new mechanism in neuronal ligand-gated ion channels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chung, S-K.","Vanbellinghen, J-F.","Mullins, J.G.","Robinson, A.","Hantke, J.","Hammond, C.L.","Gilbert, D.F.","Freilinger, M.","Ryan, M.","Kruer, M.C.","Masri, A.","Gurses, C.","Ferrie, C.","Harvey, K.","Shiang, R.","Christodoulou, J.","Andermann, F.","Andermann, E.","Thomas, R.H.","Harvey, R.J.","Lynch, J.W.","Rees, M.I."],"dc:date":"2010","doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1763-10.2010.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99671,"sim:weight":0.561675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4879672,"sim:weight":0.4894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99672,"sim:weight":0.466189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111781,"sim:weight":0.424032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99520,"sim:weight":0.397902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870061,"sim:weight":0.376567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.319709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.310716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.300631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.284939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632025,"sim:weight":0.275247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145468,"sim:weight":0.245845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184423,"sim:weight":0.245432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.243375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7223,"sim:weight":0.241686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.239892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.239888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.236546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.236458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.229387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this study was to describe asthma drug use in children with and without asthma in the Netherlands (NL), Italy (IT), and the United Kingdom (UK). We conducted a retrospective analysis of outpatient medical records of children 0-18 years from 1 January 2000 until 31 December 2005. For all children, prescription rates of asthma drugs were studied by country, age, asthma diagnosis, and off-label status. One-year prevalence rates were calculated per 100 children per patient-year (PY). The cohort consisted of 671,831 children of whom 49,442 had been diagnosed with asthma at any time during follow-up. ß2-mimetics and inhaled steroids were the most frequently prescribed asthma drug classes in NL (4.9 and 4.1/100 PY), the UK (8.7 and 5.3/100 PY) and IT (7.2 and 16.2/100 PY), respectively. Xanthines, anticholinergics, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and anti-allergics were prescribed in less than one child per 100 per year. In patients without asthma, ß2-mimetics were used most frequently. Country differences were highest for steroids, (Italy highest), and for ß2-mimetics (the UK highest). Off-label use was low, and most pronounced for ß2-mimetics in children \u003c18 months (IT) and combined ß2-mimetics + anticholinergics in children \u003c6 years (NL). CONCLUSION: This study shows that among all asthma drugs, ß2-mimetics and inhaled steroids are most often used, also in children without asthma, and with large variability between countries. Linking multi-country databases allows us to study country specific pediatric drug use in a systematic manner without being hampered by methodological differences. This study underlines the potency of healthcare databases in rapidly providing data on pediatric drug use and possibly safety.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sen, E.F.","Verhamme, K.M.C.","Neubert, A.","Hsia, Y.F.","Murray, M.L.","Felisi, M.","Giaquinto, C.","\u0027t Jong, G.W.","Picelli, G.","Baraldi, E.","Nicolosi, A.","Ceci, A.","Wong, I.C.K.","Sturkenboom, M.C.J.M."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1007/s00431-010-1275-7.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98656,"sim:weight":0.540002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.476512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55751,"sim:weight":0.342906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25871,"sim:weight":0.339693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158267,"sim:weight":0.288501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11157,"sim:weight":0.272387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10043,"sim:weight":0.271476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.261807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.257864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65377,"sim:weight":0.256606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105299,"sim:weight":0.247861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.245818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.245818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24852,"sim:weight":0.241653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.241093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99386,"sim:weight":0.240644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177092,"sim:weight":0.240398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42189,"sim:weight":0.236625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177062,"sim:weight":0.235071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98758,"sim:weight":0.234111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is true for a variety of end points representing a wide range of organizational levels and biological complexity. Combinations of EDs are able to produce significant effect, even when each chemical is present at low doses that individually do not induce observable effects. However, comparatively little is known about mixtures composed of chemicals from different classes of EDs. Nevertheless, I argue that the accumulated evidence seriously undermines continuation with the customary chemical-by-chemical approach to risk assessment for EDs. Instead, we should seriously consider group-wise regulation of classes of EDs. Great care should be taken to define such classes by using suitable similarity criteria. Criteria should focus on common effects, rather than common mechanisms. In this review I also highlight research needs and identify the lack of information about exposure scenarios as a knowledge gap that seriously hampers progress with ED risk assessment. Future research should focus on investigating the effects of combinations of EDs from different categories, with considerable emphasis on elucidating mechanisms. This strategy may lead to better-defined criteria for grouping EDs for regulatory purposes. Also, steps should be taken to develop dedicated mixtures exposure assessment for EDs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kortenkamp, A."],"dc:date":"2007","doi":"10.1289/ehp.9357.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":111789,"sim:weight":0.744437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":241620,"sim:weight":0.598726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113681,"sim:weight":0.594958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64141,"sim:weight":0.572266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111788,"sim:weight":0.505041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111791,"sim:weight":0.494693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111787,"sim:weight":0.477859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97721,"sim:weight":0.44735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769051,"sim:weight":0.440214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60550,"sim:weight":0.438186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222881,"sim:weight":0.379775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":557988,"sim:weight":0.371826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.345984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.327522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.326631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84632,"sim:weight":0.326165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.32253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.318596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.302278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040474,"sim:weight":0.298255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Human populations, however, are exposed to mixtures of estrogenic and estrogen-like agents and it is necessary to consider the impact of combined effects. We assessed the combined effects of 1-(o-chlorophenyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane (o,p\u0027-DDT), 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (p,p\u0027-DDE), beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH), and 1,1-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane (p,p\u0027-DDT) on the induction of cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells. All four compounds are persistent organochlorines that can be found in human tissues. We performed extensive concentration-response analyses with the single agents to predict the effects of two mixtures of all four compounds with different mixture ratios. We calculated the predictions by using the pharmacologically well-founded models of concentration addition and independent action and then tested them experimentally. o,p\u0027-DDT, p,p\u0027-DDE, beta-HCH, and p,p\u0027-DDT acted together to produce proliferative effects in MCF-7 cells. The combined effect of the four agents could be predicted on the basis of data about single agent concentration-response relationships. Regression analysis demonstrated that there were combination effects even when each mixture component was present at levels at or below its individual no-observed-effect-concentration. We assessed combination effects in two ways: First, evaluations in relation to the proliferative responses induced by single mixture components revealed that the combination effects were stronger than the effects of the most potent constituent. Thus, according to this method of evaluation, the combined effects may be termed synergistic. Second, comparisons with the expected effects, as predicted by concentration addition and independent action, showed excellent agreement between prediction and observation. With this approach, the combined effect of all four compounds can be termed additive.","bibo:AuthorList":["Payne, J.","Scholze, M.","Kortenkamp, A."],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":113681,"sim:weight":0.674924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":241620,"sim:weight":0.523997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111790,"sim:weight":0.494693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111788,"sim:weight":0.475461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111789,"sim:weight":0.470387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64141,"sim:weight":0.354722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.233123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.227653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.22626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.215517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97721,"sim:weight":0.21371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.209674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.203741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17932,"sim:weight":0.198772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.192415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.186951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.185594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.183441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.180487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040471,"sim:weight":0.176648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We have also studied the ability of chromate, on reaction with ascorbate as well as in mixed solutions of ascorbate and GSH, to cause DNA strand breaks. In both fully demetalated and conventional (i.e., metal contaminated) systems, chromate and GSH induced similar numbers of DNA strand breaks. This observation suggests that traces of iron or copper contaminating the reaction mixtures do not play a major role in the DNA cleavage caused by chromate and GSH. A series of hydroxyl radical scavengers exhibited a protective influence on the induction of DNA strand breaks. However, glucose and sucrose, both strong hydroxyl radical scavengers, showed no concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA cleavage. Competition kinetics studies yielded apparent rate constants that were not consistent with hydroxyl radicals being the species responsible for DNA strand breaks. Ascorbate in combination with chromate was also found to induce strand breaks in DNA; this damage could be attributed to reactive intermediates generated during the reduction. When mixed systems of ascorbate and GSH in the presence of chromate were investigated, there were clearly interactions between the two reductants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kortenkamp, A.","O\u0027Brien, P."],"dc:date":"1994","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.283367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101347,"sim:weight":0.26137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890299,"sim:weight":0.192837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.170193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101214,"sim:weight":0.169305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99284,"sim:weight":0.16009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.157257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.155847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101346,"sim:weight":0.153652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98669,"sim:weight":0.153576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.150441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98670,"sim:weight":0.1504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381911,"sim:weight":0.149471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101526,"sim:weight":0.149046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.145401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.144196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.141881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.135978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146046,"sim:weight":0.134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.133362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Seven young male Labrador Retrievers presented for evaluation of stiff gait.\r\n\r\nResults: All affected dogs had generalized muscular stiffness, persistent at rest and resulting in restricted joint movements. They showed a forward flexed posture, festinating gait, and bradykinesia. Signs developed between 2 and 16 months of age and tended to stabilize in adulthood. Needle electromyogram in the conscious state showed continuous motor unit activity in resting epaxial and proximal limb muscles. This activity was abolished by general anesthesia. Muscle and nerve histopathology was normal. In 2 dogs necropsied, astrocytosis was evident throughout the spinal cord gray matter, reticular formation and caudate nuclei. Decreased neuronal counts were selectively found in the spinal cord Rexed\u0027s lamina VII, but not in VIII and IX. Pedigree analysis showed that the affected dogs were from 5 related litters.\r\n\r\nConclusions and Clinical Importance: This new hypertonicity syndrome in Labrador Retrievers is unique because of the selective distribution of the histological lesions, the lack of progression in adulthood, and its exclusive occurrence in male dogs. Pedigree analysis suggests an X-linked hereditary disease, although other modes of inheritance cannot be ruled out with certainty. We hypothesize that altered output from basal nuclei and reticular formation together with motor neuron disinhibition caused by a decreased number of spinal cord interneurons leads to the muscular stiffness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vanhaesebrouck, A.E.","Shelton, G.D.","Garosi, L.","Harcourt-Brown, T.R.","Couturier, J.","Behr, S.","Harvey, R.J.","Jeffery, N.D.","Matiasek, K.","Blakemore, W.F.","Granger, N."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.0757.x.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":111781,"sim:weight":0.3889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.345481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111796,"sim:weight":0.344045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501129,"sim:weight":0.32579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385391,"sim:weight":0.310392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.309448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360880,"sim:weight":0.30375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":458151,"sim:weight":0.296579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":544689,"sim:weight":0.295806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501130,"sim:weight":0.293781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81365,"sim:weight":0.281491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664640,"sim:weight":0.277353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.257088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.232565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.230625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.229673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.226144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.222186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.22152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.2214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Episodes are triggered by exercise, stress or excitement and characterized by progressive hypertonicity throughout the thoracic and pelvic limbs, resulting in a characteristic \u0027deer-stalking\u0027 position and/or collapse. We used a genome-wide association strategy to map the EFS locus to a 3.48Mb critical interval on canine chromosome 7. By prioritizing candidate genes on the basis of biological plausibility, we found that a 15.7kb deletion in BCAN, encoding the brain-specific extracellular matrix proteoglycan brevican, is associated with EFS. This represents a compelling causal mutation for EFS, since brevican has an essential role in the formation of perineuronal nets governing synapse stability and nerve conduction velocity. Mapping of the deletion breakpoint enabled the development of Multiplex PCR and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) genotyping tests that can accurately distinguish normal, carrier and affected animals. Wider testing of a larger population of CKCS dogs without a history of EFS from the USA revealed that carriers are extremely common (12.9%). The development of molecular genetic tests for the EFS microdeletion will allow the implementation of directed breeding programs aimed at minimizing the number of animals with EFS and enable confirmatory diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of affected dogs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gill, J.L.","Tsai, K.L.","Krey, C.","Noorai, R.E.","Vanbellinghen, J-F.","Garosi, L.","Shelton, G.D.","Clark, L.A.","Harvey, R.J."],"dc:date":"2012-01","doi":"10.1016/j.nbd.2011.07.014.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":111781,"sim:weight":0.516595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111795,"sim:weight":0.344045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.319334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387096,"sim:weight":0.310069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.303039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99671,"sim:weight":0.289649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.26285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23870,"sim:weight":0.239462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.236803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.2346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75994,"sim:weight":0.230755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98535,"sim:weight":0.227338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632025,"sim:weight":0.224172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99402,"sim:weight":0.223818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.21456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.212956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98501,"sim:weight":0.212262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.211486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386812,"sim:weight":0.20966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.209508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using yeast two-hybrid and pull down assays, we show that synArfGEF is able to bind utrophin/dystrophin and S-SCAM/MAGI-2 scaffolding proteins that localize at inhibitory synapses. Double immunostaining reveals that synArfGEF co-localizes with dystrophin and S-SCAM in cultured hippocampal neurons and cerebellar cortex, respectively. Both β-dystroglycan and S-SCAM were immunoprecipitated from brain lysates using anti-synArfGEF IgG.

However it remains to be established whether the causative factor is the reported toxicity of A beta or reduced production of secretory derivatives of APP which may have trophic or neuroprotective properties. One possible contributory factor to an imbalance in APP metabolism is the impaired cellular energy availability described in AD. The aim of this study was to investigate processing of APP-like proteins following inhibition of oxidative energy metabolism in PC12 cells. Under these conditions, intracellular and secreted APP-like proteins were significantly reduced. Treatment of energy perturbed cells with the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine restored intracellular concentrations of APP-like proteins to the control range, while the secretion was completely restored by activation of protein kinase C. These findings raise the possibility that energy related metabolic stress may lead to altered metabolism of APP-like proteins favouring a potentially amyloidogenic pathway. Furthermore, the observation that activation of PKC is able to overcome this potentially pathogenic process has important implications for treatment of AD with the current generation of cholinomimetic drugs, suggesting that such drugs may slow disease progression as well as improve cognitive dysfunction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Webster, M-T.","Pearce, B.R.","Bowen, D.M.","Francis, P.T."],"dc:date":"1998","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98535,"sim:weight":0.383103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.283892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24505,"sim:weight":0.282782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.270801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.270694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.266315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.261252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.260753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.260688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.249516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.247895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.244389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99402,"sim:weight":0.240406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.235393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387047,"sim:weight":0.231681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.230114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.224896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.224598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385429,"sim:weight":0.219672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710687,"sim:weight":0.210384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In both adult and immature slices, CGP 52432 (1 microM) had no effect on neuronal membrane properties, whereas it selectively abolished the late inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) evoked by local electrical stimulation of association fibre terminals. Age-related changes in mAChR (but not mGluR) responsiveness were also detected. In adult neurones, bath-application of the mAChR agonist oxotremorine-M (OXO-M; 10 microM), or the selective mGluR agonist 1S,3R-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD; 10 microM) evoked similar membrane depolarization and inhibition of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). However, while 1S,3R-ACPD and OXO-M produced indistinguishable slow excitatory effects in immature slices, during superfusion with OXO-M, neurones exhibited spontaneous paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDSs) that were suppressed in the presence of atropine (1 microM) or the selective GABA(B) receptor agonist beta-parachlorophenyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid [(-)baclofen; 10 microM]. Also, application of OXO-M resulted in a pronounced prolongation (rather than a decrease) of electrically evoked postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) which now exhibited recurrent superimposed spike discharges. In adult slices, in the continuous presence of CGP 52432 (1 microM; 20 min pre-incubation), a subsequent exposure to 10 microM OXO-M or 1S,3R-ACPD failed to induce any spontaneous epileptiform activity, and evoked PSPs were consistently suppressed. In contrast, in immature slices, after incubation in CGP 52432 (1 microM; 20 min), a subsequent application of a low dose of OXO-M (2.5 microM), which was inactive per se, was able to produce spontaneous PDSs and a prolongation of evoked PSPs. We conclude that a reduction in GABA(B)-mediated synaptic inhibition in immature slices (in co-operation with other factors) may contribute to the facilitation of excitatory neurotransmission and therefore play a role in the generation of mAChR-induced epileptiform activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Libri, V.","Constanti, A.","Postlethwaite, M.","Bowery, N.G."],"dc:date":"1998","doi":"10.1007/PL00005239.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2709952,"sim:weight":0.268558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584828,"sim:weight":0.25888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.226163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268784,"sim:weight":0.215546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387403,"sim:weight":0.208216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81250,"sim:weight":0.205268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382406,"sim:weight":0.20508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76477,"sim:weight":0.202069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501129,"sim:weight":0.201255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113355,"sim:weight":0.200883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99159,"sim:weight":0.199549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46344,"sim:weight":0.198444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.193187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111762,"sim:weight":0.187848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101408,"sim:weight":0.184544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360880,"sim:weight":0.184197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.182865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98640,"sim:weight":0.181845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":544689,"sim:weight":0.175053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111777,"sim:weight":0.17262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, there is a gap in the ethnopharmacological literature in terms of understanding what relevance a critical analysis of value chains of herbal medicines could have.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nAn extensive review of the literature available on value chains and their analysis was conducted, based both on a systematic online search of the relevant literature and a hand search of bibliographies and discussions with experts in value chain analysis\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nWhile the concept of value chains is commonly used in the relevant industries, very few studies investigate the value chains of herbal medicines and products derived from them.

All five will act as controls until they receive the intervention in a random sequence.

Once trained, community pharmacists will meet recruited patients, either in their pharmacies (in a consultation room or dispensary to preserve confidentiality) or at home. They will identify drug-related issues/problems, and design a pharmaceutical care plan in conjunction with both the GP and the patient. They will implement, monitor, and update this plan monthly. The primary outcome measure is the \u0027Medication Appropriateness Index\u0027. Secondary measures include adverse events, quality of life, and patient knowledge and compliance.

We have addressed this problem with specific relevance to a class of hyperbranched macromolecules known as dendrimers by describing a new concept and developing a method that translates monomeric linear sequences into a full atomistic model of a hyperbranched molecule. Such molecular-modeling-based advances will enable modeling studies of important biological interactions between naturally occurring macromolecules and synthetic macromolecules. Our results also suggest that it should be possible to apply this sequence-based methodology to generate hyperbranched structures of other dendrimeric structures and of linear polymers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barata, T.S.","Brocchini, S.","Teo, I.","Shaunak, S.","Zloh, M."],"dc:date":"2011","doi":"10.1007/s00894-011-0966-y.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99707,"sim:weight":0.647355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84820,"sim:weight":0.371391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108049,"sim:weight":0.366507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387283,"sim:weight":0.34995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23297,"sim:weight":0.332198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271098,"sim:weight":0.330427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.325375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710180,"sim:weight":0.320884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47658,"sim:weight":0.314314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99378,"sim:weight":0.312434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332856,"sim:weight":0.2908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.282293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890299,"sim:weight":0.281818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.279786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12333,"sim:weight":0.275373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99485,"sim:weight":0.274975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.27247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.265393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890301,"sim:weight":0.265303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101542,"sim:weight":0.263588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Application of a test and reference reaction","bibo:abstract":"Isothermal calorimetry is finding extensive application in a number of research areas. This popularity is reflected in the number of commercially available instruments which are capable of yielding a variety of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Whilst there has been much discussion of ways in which to validate any values returned from these instruments very little has been done quantitatively to compare the relative performances of different instruments. This paper highlights the use of a test and reference reaction quantitatively to compare the performance of three instruments (Thermometric TAM, THT µRC and a Setaram HSDSC III); the specifications of these instruments provide a range from high-sensitivity, long equilibration time to lower-sensitivity, short equilibration time. The comparison is made through a statistical analysis of values returned for the rate constant, enthalpy of reaction and activation energy for the base catalysed hydrolysis of methyl paraben. The statistical analysis from the data set discussed here indicates that there is no significant difference between the returned thermodynamic and kinetic parameters from the TAM and µRC. The analysis revealed however that the HSDSC returns values for the rate constant which are significantly different from both the TAM and µRC, although it is noted that this instrument was not specifically designed to operate in a step-isothermal mode and that it was possible to apply a correction to the data. In all cases the enthalpy data returned from all instruments were statistically similar although the µRC and HSDSC returned values which were, for the rate constant and activation energy, less precise than those obtained from the TAM. As well as highlighting the importance of using test and reference reactions, this study also shows that proper instrument selection is an important factor when designing a calorimetric experimental series.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Neill, M.A.A.","Gaisford, S.","Beezer, A.E.","Skaria, C.V.","Sears, P."],"dc:date":"2006-05-09","doi":"10.1007/s10973-005-7488-8.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1650745,"sim:weight":0.395117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43511,"sim:weight":0.360133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.327886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.311424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.297026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43103,"sim:weight":0.286258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.28329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Setting One clinical directorate of a London teaching trust. Methods Ward pharmacists recorded all prescribing errors identified in newly written medication orders on one day each fortnight between February and May 2005. We examined prescribing errors reported on the trust’s medication incident database for the same period. Main outcome measures Prescribing errors identified and recorded by ward pharmacists, prescribing errors reported as incident reports; prescribing error rates per clinical specialty; lead consultants’ views on receiving feedback on errors for their specialty. Results During eight data collection days, 4,995 new medication orders were examined. Of these, 462 (9.2%; 95% confidence interval 8.5 –10.1%) contained at least one prescribing error. There were 474 errors in total. Pharmacists indicated that they would have reported 19 (4%) of the prescribing errors as medication incidents. Eight prescribing errors were reported for the entire four-month study period on non-data collection days. Feedback was presented to lead clinicians of 10 clinical specialties. This included graphical summaries showing how the specialty compared with others, and a list of errors identified. This information was well-received by clinicians. Conclusion Prescribing errors identified by ward pharmacists can be systematically fed back at the level of the clinical specialty; this is acceptable to the consultants involved. Incident report data is subject to gross under-reporting. Routinely providing feedback for each consultant team or for individual prescribers will require more focussed data collection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Franklin, B.D.","O\u0027Grady, K.","Paschalides, C.","Utley, M.","Gallivan, S.","Jacklin, A.","Barber, N."],"dc:date":"2007-06","doi":"10.1007/s11096-006-9075-x.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99600,"sim:weight":0.676664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43609,"sim:weight":0.473501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.4689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.431042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385794,"sim:weight":0.400434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631545,"sim:weight":0.318442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.293692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316148,"sim:weight":0.268951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.261252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43411,"sim:weight":0.259754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.255794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77300,"sim:weight":0.255355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.25506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1655008,"sim:weight":0.253748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":381698,"sim:weight":0.249314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102665,"sim:weight":0.247159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.246968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656477,"sim:weight":0.235569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43505,"sim:weight":0.234714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.233168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We searched this and the other works of Cervantes for references to plants, plant communities, and products. These texts capture the customs, thoughts, beliefs, and traditions of Spanish culture in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. They also repeat literary themes of ancient Greek and Roman literature. Plant citations were grouped in three categories: plants as part of the environment, useful plants, and plants in symbolic expressions. A total of 150 species were registered, 102 of which appear inDon Quijote. The taxa with the highest frequency of occurrence areVitis vinifera, Phoenix dactylifera, Triticum aestivum, Laurus nobilis, Rosa spp.,Olea europaea, Quercus ilex, andArundo donax. The number of references to plants and the variety of species seem to attest to a sound and intimate knowledge of plants, their relevance as a landscape feature, and their utility. Many edible, ornamental, technological, and medicinal plants are referred to either explicitly or implicitly.

In this work, hot and cold water extracts as well as ethanol/water mixtures (tinctures) of cannabis were compared in order to better understand how these extracts differ in their overall composition. NMR analysis and in vitro cell assays of crude extracts and fractions were performed. Manufacturing procedures to produce natural remedies can strongly affect the final composition of the herbal medicines. Temperature and polarity of the solvents used for the extraction resulted to be two factors that affect the total amount of Delta(9)-THC in the extracts and its relative quantity with respect to Delta(9)-THC-acid and other metabolites. Diffusion-edited (1)H NMR (1D DOSY) and (1)H NMR with suppression of the ethanol and water signals were used. With this method it was possible, without any evaporation or separation step, to distinguish between tinctures from different cannabis cultivars. This approach is proposed as a direct analysis of plant tinctures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Politi, M.","Peschel, W.","Wilson, N.D.","Zloh, M.","Prieto-Garcia, J.M.","Heinrich, M."],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.07.018.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98550,"sim:weight":0.279886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84807,"sim:weight":0.266036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387403,"sim:weight":0.254187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.248907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.222075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.222075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.218266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890299,"sim:weight":0.214539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.213982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2835560,"sim:weight":0.204765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18949,"sim:weight":0.204765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.201887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98788,"sim:weight":0.201278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.200211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.198403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.195438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890301,"sim:weight":0.193999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.189832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.185347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.184272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The use of food plants, for example, is a practice that has developed over generations and is part of the traditional knowledge system. However, for methodological reasons, the historical development of plant use is difficult to ascertain in cultures which rely on the oral transmission of knowledge. Here we discuss the antiquity of non-cultivated food plant use in the Graecanic area in Calabria, Southern Italy. We compare today’s gathered food plants in this ethnic Greek community with non-cultivated food plant use in modern and classical Greece using linguistic-historical methods. Fourteen cognates have been found, such as Portulaca oleracea (purslane), which is called andrácla in the Graecanic area in Southern Italy and andrákla in Greece. The young leaves of purslane are used as salad in both areas. Plants with such cognates are likely to have been used in the study region as vegetables, salads, or condiments since the time Magna Graecia flourished in Southern Italy more than 2,000 years ago.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heinrich, M.","Nebel, S."],"dc:date":"2009-02-03","doi":"10.1007/s12231-008-9069-9.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":111659,"sim:weight":0.55257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1131997,"sim:weight":0.419477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.34724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.34724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85677,"sim:weight":0.330386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43702,"sim:weight":0.310051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85626,"sim:weight":0.309424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109060,"sim:weight":0.295185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52008,"sim:weight":0.287524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62357,"sim:weight":0.281004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.273369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.272593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76824,"sim:weight":0.271404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.263026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.261385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.258965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90566,"sim:weight":0.258009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43677,"sim:weight":0.256634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61296,"sim:weight":0.255343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108501,"sim:weight":0.252424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Respiratory tract infection was the most common indication for which an antibiotic was prescribed, followed by “abnormal signs and symptoms”, ear and skin infections. Antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections have decreased by 31% (p\u003c0.01) mainly because of reduced prescribing for lower respiratory tract infections (56% decline, p\u003c0.001) and specific upper respiratory tract infections including tonsillitis/pharyngitis (48% decline, p\u003c0.001) and otitis (46% decline, p\u003c0.001). Prescribing for non-specific upper respiratory tract infection increased fourfold (p\u003c0.001). Prescribing for “abnormal signs and symptoms” increased significantly since 2001 (40% increase, p\u003c0.001). \r\n\r\nConclusion: There has been a marked decrease in community antibiotic prescribing linked to lower respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, pharyngitis and otitis.

The increase in numbers of people being diagnosed with diabetes is posing a challenge for both the UK and the rest of the world. The peak age for diagnosis is between 10 and 14 years of age. There is clear evidence that improved diabetes control from diagnosis in childhood can reduce the incidence and progression of long-term complications. However, despite the development of improved insulin regimens and delivery methods, the overall metabolic control in children and adolescents has improved little in the UK in the past decade. Therefore there is a need for novel interventions and health delivery mechanisms aimed at young people and their families to help improve control and reduce complications, illness burden and costs to the NHS.\r\n\r\nMethods/Design\r\nThe CASCADE trial is a multi-centre randomised control trial with 26 clinics randomised to control or intervention groups, with 572 children and young people involved in the study. The intervention will be delivered in 4 group sessions, over a 4 month period. A developmentally appropriate curriculum will be delivered to groups of 3 - 4 families, focusing on achievement of increasing competency in self-management of diabetes. The control group will receive standard care from their clinical team, usually consisting of regular 3-monthly clinic visits and telephone contact as required with the clinical nurse specialist and consultant. The primary outcomes of the trial will be change in HbA1c between baseline and 12 months and 24 months post recruitment. Secondary outcomes will include measures related to the economic evaluation, psychosocial outcomes, outcomes related to management of diabetes outcomes, and adherence to the intervention.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe trial will be run by independent research and service delivery teams and supervised by a trial steering committee. A data monitoring and ethics committee has been put in place to monitor the trial and recommend stopping/continuation according to a Peto-Haybittle rule. The trial will be conducted according to the principles of MRC Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines and CTRU Phase III Trial Standard Operating procedures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Christie, D.","Strange, V.","Allen, E.","Oliver, S.","Wong, I.C.K.","Smith, F.J.","Cairns, J.","Thompson, R.","Hindmarsh, P.C.","O\u0027Neill, S.","Bull, C.","Viner, R.","Elbourne, D."],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.1186/1471-2431-9-57.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145584,"sim:weight":0.625172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.606489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.498024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8337,"sim:weight":0.457089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.427018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.408037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.407955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.403581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708124,"sim:weight":0.393705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.389517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.388912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.388912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.388912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.388912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.388912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.388912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.388912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.388912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.388912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.388912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Prescribing patterns, annual prevalence, morbidity patterns, and time to discontinuation of ATD use were identified. \r\n\r\nResults: A total of 24 976 subjects received 93 091 prescriptions; 51 868 (55.7%), 38 429 (41.3%), and 2708 (2.9%) prescriptions were for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and other ATDs respectively. ATD prevalence increased 1.7-fold from 1992 to 2001. TCA prevalence decreased by 30% from 3.6 to 2.5 per 1,000; SSRI prevalence increased 10 times from 0.5 to 4.6 per 1,000. In new ATD users aged ≤10 years, the most common diagnosis associated with TCA use was nocturnal enuresis (75.1%); in those aged ≥15 years, it was depression (45.8%). Depression was also associated with SSRI use (69.0%). For new users with depression, the median treatment durations for TCAs and SSRIs were 30 and 58 days respectively. TCA users were more likely to terminate treatment than SSRI users (TCAs v fluoxetine: 1.40, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.47; non-fluoxetine SSRIs v fluoxetine: 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.07). \r\n\r\nConclusions: SSRIs have gained popularity for the treatment of depression compared with TCAs. TCAs are still used despite their lack of efficacy in prepubertal depression and their moderate effect in adolescents. However, \u003e50% of subjects discontinue treatment after two months, with TCA users stopping earlier than SSRI users.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murray, M.L.","de Vries, C.S.","Wong, I.C.K."],"dc:date":"2004","doi":"10.1136/adc.2004.064956","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":49223,"sim:weight":0.324256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145722,"sim:weight":0.246099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2834540,"sim:weight":0.231036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99386,"sim:weight":0.209137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387164,"sim:weight":0.20811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.205652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.20553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42189,"sim:weight":0.202081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.1982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.196984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.184656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9612543,"sim:weight":0.182626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.181924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1151822,"sim:weight":0.180577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.178097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.175272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24404,"sim:weight":0.174465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.172028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.172028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98656,"sim:weight":0.171069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The extent of their agreement on a definition of a prescribing error, and on 40 scenarios that might be classified as prescribing errors in paediatric practice, was obtained. \r\n\r\nResults: Response rates were 84% (n \u003d 42) in the first Delphi round and 95% (n \u003d 40) in the second. Consensus was to accept the general definition of a prescribing error. In addition, there was consensus that 27 of the 40 scenarios should be included as prescribing errors, 10 should be excluded, and three may be considered prescribing errors depending on the individual clinical situation. Failure to communicate essential information, transcription errors and the use of drugs, formulations, or doses inappropriate for the individual patient were considered prescribing errors. Deviations from policies or guidelines, use of unlicensed and off-label drugs, and omission of non-essential information were not considered prescribing errors. \r\n\r\nConclusion: A general definition of a prescribing error has been developed that is applicable to the paediatric setting, together with more detailed guidance regarding the types of events that should be included.

In sympathetic neurons, M-channels are thought to be composed of a heteromeric assembly of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 K(+) channel subunits. Here, we have tried to identify the KCNQ subunits that are involved in the generation of I(K(M)) in hippocampal pyramidal neurons cultured from 5- to 7-day-old rats. RT-PCR of either CA1 or CA3 regions revealed the presence of KCNQ2, KCNQ3, KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 subunits. Single-cell PCR of dissociated hippocampal pyramidal neurons gave detectable signals for only KCNQ2, KCNQ3 and KCNQ5; where tested, most also expressed mRNA for the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT1. Staining for KCNQ2 and KCNQ5 protein showed punctate fluorescence on both the somata and dendrites of hippocampal neurons. Staining for KCNQ3 was diffusely distributed whereas KCNQ4 was undetectable. In perforated patch recordings, linopirdine, a specific M-channel blocker, fully inhibited I(K(M)) with an IC(50) of 3.6 +/- 1.5 microM. In 70 % of these cells, TEA fully suppressed I(K(M)) with an IC(50) of 0.7 +/- 0.1 mM. In the remaining cells, TEA maximally reduced I(K(M)) by only 59.7 +/- 5.2 % with an IC(50) of 1.4 +/- 0.3 mM; residual I(K(M)) was abolished by linopirdine.

{"identifier":113673,"ep:Repository":90,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Glycine receptors in cultured chick sympathetic neurons are excitatory and trigger neurotransmitter release.","bibo:abstract":"1. Total RNA isolated from embryonic chick paravertebral sympathetic ganglia was used in a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay with a pair of degenerate oligonucleotide primers deduced from conserved regions of mammalian glycine receptor alpha-subunits. Three classes of cDNA were identified which encode portions of the chicken homologues of the mammalian glycine receptor alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits. 2. The presence of functional glycine receptors was investigated in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique in neurons dissociated from the ganglia and kept in culture for 7-8 days. In cells voltage clamped to -70 mV, glycine consistently induced inward currents in a concentration-dependent manner and elicited half-maximal peak current amplitudes at 43 microM. 3. The steady-state current-voltage relation for glycine-induced currents was linear between +80 and -60 mV, but showed outward rectification at more hyperpolarized potentials. Reversal potentials of these currents shifted with changes in intracellular chloride concentrations and matched the calculated Nernst potentials for chloride. 4. beta-Alanine and taurine were significantly less potent than glycine in triggering inward currents, with half-maximal responses at 79 and 86 microM, respectively. At maximally active concentrations, beta-alanine-evoked currents were identical in amplitude to those induced by glycine. Taurine-evoked currents, in contrast, never reached the same amplitude as glycine-induced currents. 5. The classical glycine receptor antagonist strychnine reversibly reduced glycine-induced currents, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 62 nM. Two more recently characterized glycine receptor antagonists, isonipecotic acid (half-maximal inhibition at 2 mM) and 7-trifluoromethyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (half-maximal inhibition at 67 microM), also blocked glycine-evoked currents in a reversible manner. The chloride channel blocker picrotoxin reduced glycine-evoked currents, with half-maximal effects at 348 microM. Inhibition by the glycine receptor channel blocker cyanotriphenylborate was half-maximal at 4 microM. 6. Apart from evoking inward currents, glycine occasionally triggered short (\u003c 100 ms) spike-like currents which were abolished by hexamethonium and thus reflected synaptic release of endogenous acetylcholine. In addition, glycine caused Ca(2+)-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive tritium overflow from neurons previously labelled with [3H]noradrenaline. This stimulatory action of glycine was reduced in the presence of strychnine and after treatment with the chloride uptake inhibitor furosemide (frusemide). 7. In 65% of neurons loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester, glycine increased the ratio of the fluorescence signal obtained with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, respectively, which indicates a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. 8.

For this purpose we employed the models of concentration addition and independent action, both well-established models for the calculation of mixture effects. Experimental concentration-response analyses revealed good agreement between predicted and observed mixture effects in all cases. Our results show that the combined effect of o,p\u0027-DDT, genistein, 4-nonylphenol, and 4-n-octylphenol in the YES assay does not deviate from expected additivity.

Significant antitumor activity was demonstrated in several human tumor xenograft models. Cures were obtained in a LOX-IMVI melanoma model following a single administration and dose-dependent activity, including regression responses, observed in SKOV-3 ovarian and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia models following repeat dose schedules.

Another argument used to dismiss concerns of health effects is that endogenous steroidal estrogens are too potent for xenoestrogens to contribute significantly to estrogenic effects. Using a yeast reporter gene assay with the human estrogen receptoralpha, we tested these ideas experimentally by assessing the ability of a combination of 11 xenoestrogens to affect the actions of 17ss-estradiol. Significantly, each xenoestrogen was present at a level well below its no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC). To derive accurate descriptions of low effects, we recorded concentration-response relationships for each xenoestrogen and for 17ss-estradiol. We used these data to predict entire concentration-response curves of mixtures of xenoestrogens with 17ss-estradiol, assuming additive combination effects. Over a large range of concentrations, the experimentally observed responses decisively confirmed the model predictions. The combined additive effect of the 11 xenoestrogens led to a dramatic enhancement of the hormone\u0027s action, even when each single agent was present below its NOEC. Our results show that not even sub-NOEC levels of xenoestrogens can be considered to be without effect on potent steroidal estrogens when they act in concert with a large number of similarly acting chemicals. It remains to be seen to what degree these effects can be neutralized by environmental chemicals with antiestrogenic activity. Nevertheless, potential human and wildlife responses induced by additive combination effects of xenoestrogens deserve serious consideration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rajapakse, N.","Silva, E.","Kortenkamp, A."],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":113681,"sim:weight":0.68275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111790,"sim:weight":0.598726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111789,"sim:weight":0.546789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111791,"sim:weight":0.523997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111788,"sim:weight":0.453806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64141,"sim:weight":0.389253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.249811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17932,"sim:weight":0.24183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.241746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.239728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.23133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.228746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.22635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.22635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.22635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.22635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.22635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.22635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.22635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.22635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Various powder and tablet characterisation procedures were applied. The surface energy of the powders was characterized by Inverse Gas Chromatography and the compressibility of the powders was described by the relationship between tablet porosity and compression pressure. The compactibility of the powders was analyzed by studying the evolution of tablet tensile strength with increasing compaction pressure and porosity. \r\nResults  \r\nAll powders were amorphous and similar in particle size, shape, and surface area. The compressibility of the powders and the microstructure of the formed tablets were equal. However, the compactibility and dispersive surface energy was dependent of the composition of the powders. \r\nConclusion  \r\nThe decrease in tablet strength correlated to the decrease in powder surface energy at constant tablet porosities. This supports the idea that tablet strength is controlled by formation of intermolecular forces over the areas of contact between the particles and that the strength of these bonding forces is controlled by surface energy which, in turn, can be altered by the presence of surfactants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fichtner, F.","Mahlin, D.","Welch, K.","Gaisford, S.","Alderborn, G."],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.1007/s11095-008-9639-7.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222865,"sim:weight":0.426253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386459,"sim:weight":0.379803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":885370,"sim:weight":0.375874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99020,"sim:weight":0.334171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631994,"sim:weight":0.312055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8794497,"sim:weight":0.301166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176859,"sim:weight":0.297497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584831,"sim:weight":0.297422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890336,"sim:weight":0.285899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77263,"sim:weight":0.251549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.240164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.228863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316479,"sim:weight":0.224208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75935,"sim:weight":0.223102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.218096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.217212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387341,"sim:weight":0.2106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632012,"sim:weight":0.196314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631529,"sim:weight":0.191192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631579,"sim:weight":0.18847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of the study was therefore to measure the surface energy of nail plates in vivo. The surface energy of healthy human fingernails (untreated, hydrated and abraded) and of hoof membranes (often used as a model for the nailplate) was estimated from contact angle measurements of liquids (water, formamide, diiodomethane and glycerol) on the nail plate and subsequent computation using the Lifshitz-van der Waals/acid-base (LW-AB) approach. The surface energy of untreated fingernail plates was found to be 34 mJ/m2. Most of this total energy was from the apolar Lifshitz-van der Waals component. When the polar component of the surface energy was analysed, the electron-donor component was considerably larger than the electron-acceptor one. Hydrating the nail plate had no significant influence on the surface energy. In contrast, abrasion caused a small, but statistically significant increase in the apolar surface energy component. The surface energy of bovine hoof membrane was similar to that of the fingernail plate. We conclude that the human fingernail plate is a low-energy surface, and that bovine hoof membranes may be used as a substitute for the nail plate in certain experiments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murdan, S.","Poojary, C.","Patel, D.R.","Fernandes, J.","Haman, A.","Saundh, P.S.","Sheikh, Z."],"dc:date":"2012-03","doi":"10.1111/j.1468-2494.2012.00711.x.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18610,"sim:weight":0.596957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99020,"sim:weight":0.320892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.301434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780054,"sim:weight":0.295296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8794535,"sim:weight":0.287323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145800,"sim:weight":0.284959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102703,"sim:weight":0.280641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8794516,"sim:weight":0.273856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46779,"sim:weight":0.266733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.245892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68067,"sim:weight":0.209212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.203035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.200516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387341,"sim:weight":0.195265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.195082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.193507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.186029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.185937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631793,"sim:weight":0.182565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.181826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Loss of this knowledge may be a significant contributory factor towards ecological decline. Undoubtedly, disruption to ecosystems and societies that depend on these has impacted on traditional land management practices, with negative ramifications for biodiversity. From an environmental perspective, scientists in northern Australia need to understand traditional Aboriginal methods of ‘caring for country’, such as burning regimes, so that these can be incorporated into strategies today for maintaining Australia’s rich biodiversity. However, information exchange should be two-way: as well as learning from local people, science can in turn benefit people who may have little experience of, for example, invasive species. The challenge is how can the complexity of biological knowledge from within different ontologies be represented and integrated in a way that it can be of use to scientists and local people, in order to ensure a sustainable future? The main aim of this study was to record existing local knowledge of biodiversity for the community of Aurukun (far north Queensland), integrating this knowledge with scientific data, while giving parity to both knowledge systems and protecting intellectual property rights. A cross-cultural collaboration between community members and ethnobiologists resulted in development of the Aurukun Ethnobiology Database. An interdisciplinary approach was taken to effectively model autochthonous biological knowledge and scientific data to create a database with a number of practical applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edwards, S.E.","Heinrich, M."],"dc:date":"2006","doi":"10.1007/s10668-006-9056-1.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58019,"sim:weight":0.395307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382177,"sim:weight":0.382511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58415,"sim:weight":0.38164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58053,"sim:weight":0.361247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65278,"sim:weight":0.351424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385438,"sim:weight":0.333241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382175,"sim:weight":0.316819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97653,"sim:weight":0.30719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.279151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.27915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58045,"sim:weight":0.277834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.27015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89658,"sim:weight":0.264965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.251527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99092,"sim:weight":0.187385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We report the characterization of several new variants of collybistin, which are created by alternative splicing of exons encoding an N-terminal src homology 3 (SH3) domain and three alternate C termini (CB1, CB2, and CB3). The presence of the SH3 domain negatively regulates the ability of collybistin to translocate gephyrin to submembrane microaggregates in transfected mammalian cells. Because the majority of native collybistin isoforms appear to harbor the SH3 domain, this suggests that collybistin activity may be regulated by protein-protein interactions at the SH3 domain. We localized the binding sites for collybistin and the GlyR beta subunit to the C-terminal MoeA homology domain of gephyrin and show that multimerization of this domain is required for collybistin-gephyrin and GlyR-gephyrin interactions. We also demonstrate that gephyrin clustering in recombinant systems and cultured neurons requires both collybistin-gephyrin interactions and an intact collybistin pleckstrin homology domain. The vital importance of collybistin for inhibitory synaptogenesis is underlined by the discovery of a mutation (G55A) in exon 2 of the human collybistin gene (ARHGEF9) in a patient with clinical symptoms of both hyperekplexia and epilepsy. The clinical manifestation of this collybistin missense mutation may result, at least in part, from mislocalization of gephyrin and a major GABA(A) receptor subtype.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harvey, K.","Duguid, I.C.","Alldred, M.J.","Beatty, S.E.","Ward, H.","Keep, N.H.","Lingenfelter, S.E.","Pearce, B.R.","Lundgren, J.","Owen, M.J.","Smart, T.G.","Luscher, B.","Rees, M.I.","Harvey, R.J."],"dc:date":"2004-06","doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1184-04.2004.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4880253,"sim:weight":0.316334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.191553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.176513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.150541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4870061,"sim:weight":0.139481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266339,"sim:weight":0.119349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Design: Theoretically informed, longitudinal qualitative evaluation based on case studies. Setting: 12 \"early adopter\" NHS acute hospitals and specialist care settings studied over two and a half years. Data sources: Data were collected through in depth interviews, observations, and relevant documents relating directly to case study sites and to wider national developments that were perceived to impact on the implementation strategy. Data were thematically analysed, initially within and then across cases. The dataset consisted of 431 semistructured interviews with key stakeholders, including hospital staff, developers, and governmental stakeholders; 590 hours of observations of strategic meetings and use of the software in context; 334 sets of notes from observations, researchers\u0027 field notes, and notes from national conferences; 809 NHS documents; and 58 regional and national documents. Results: Implementation has proceeded more slowly, with a narrower scope and substantially less clinical functionality than was originally planned. The national strategy had considerable local consequences (summarised under five key themes), and wider national developments impacted heavily on implementation and adoption. More specifically, delays related to unrealistic expectations about the capabilities of systems; the time needed to build, configure, and customise the software; the work needed to ensure that systems were supporting provision of care; and the needs of end users for training and support. Other factors hampering progress included the changing milieu of NHS policy and priorities; repeatedly renegotiated national contracts; different stages of development of diverse NHS care records service systems; and a complex communication process between different stakeholders, along with contractual arrangements that largely excluded NHS providers. There was early evidence that deploying systems resulted in important learning within and between organisations and the development of relevant competencies within NHS hospitals. Conclusions: Implementation of the NHS Care Records Service in \"early adopter\" sites proved time consuming and challenging, with as yet limited discernible benefits for clinicians and no clear advantages for patients. Although our results might not be directly transferable to later adopting sites because the functionalities we evaluated were new and untried in the English context, they shed light on the processes involved in implementing major new systems. The move to increased local decision making that we advocated based on our interim analysis has been pursued and welcomed by the NHS, but it is important that policymakers do not lose sight of the overall goal of an integrated interoperable solution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sheikh, A.","Cornford, T.","Barber, N.","Avery, A.","Takian, A.","Lichtner, V.","Petrakaki, D.","Crowe, S.","Marsden, K.","Robertson, A.","Morrison, Z.","Klecun, E.","Prescott, R.","Quinn, C.","Jani, Y.H.","Ficociello, M.","Voutsina, K.","Paton, J.","Fernando, B.","Jacklin, A.","Cresswell, K."],"dc:date":"2011-10-17","doi":"10.1136/bmj.d6054.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Although these drugs are known to interact pharmacokinetically, several authors have proposed a pharmacodynamic interaction between the two. In order to investigate this we have studied the effects of combined treatment with LTG and VPA on basal and stimulated extracellular aspartate (ASP), glutamate (GLU), taurine (TAU), gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) release in the hippocampus of freely moving rats using microdialysis. Additionally, we measured the possible effect of VPA on LTG in plasma, whole brain and dialysates. Neither LTG (10 mg/kg) nor VPA (300 mg/kg) given alone significantly altered basal levels of ASP, GLU or TAU. When given together, however, the two drugs significantly reduced extracellular ASP and GLU while increasing TAU levels. In the case of GABA, LTG was without effect on basal levels of the transmitter, but these increased following VPA and this persisted with both drugs. When transmitter release was stimulated by 50 M veratridine, marked increases in the release of all amino acids occurred and this was decreased by LTG in all cases. VPA alone only altered GABA release, increasing it by approximately the same extent as basal GABA. For all of the amino acids studied, however, VPA reversed the decreases in release seen after LTG. VPA and LTG increased and decreased respectively basal 5-HT and DA. When given together the increase in extracellular 5-HT was greatly prolonged, but no effect on DA release was seen. When 5-HT release was evoked by veratridine this was increased by VPA and no other treatment. With DA, however, neither drug alone altered evoked release, but the two combined led to a marked increase. Co-administration of VPA with LTG showed no significant effect of this combination on LTG in any of the three compartments studied indicating that in this case a significant pharmacokinetic contribution to our findings is unlikely, which suggests that there is a probable pharmacodynamic interaction of the two drugs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ahmad, S.","Fowler, L.J.","Whitton, P.S."],"dc:date":"2005","doi":"10.1007/s00210-004-1008-4.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":360880,"sim:weight":0.164597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040616,"sim:weight":0.142755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584828,"sim:weight":0.12225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98483,"sim:weight":0.114845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2702488,"sim:weight":0.10874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99159,"sim:weight":0.101869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268784,"sim:weight":0.0952324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.0859035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23988,"sim:weight":0.07439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The sequencing of the genes for the biosynthesis of monensin A, a typical polyether ionophore polyketide, provided the first genetic evidence for the mechanism of oxidative cyclisation through which polyethers such as monensin are formed from the uncyclised products of the PKS.

To explore the use of a combined near infrared spectroscopy and gravimetric sorption apparatus in providing an accurate quantification of amorphous contents of predominantly crystalline lactose.\r\nMethods. Key wavelengths on the near infrared spectra of amorphous and crystalline lactose were used to construct a calibration plot of spectral fit to amorphous content. The extent of water sorption and desorption at 75% relative humidity (RH) was used to quantify the amount of amorphous material in the sample.\r\nResults. Near infrared spectroscopy was used to quantify the amorphous contents of a set of 10 partially amorphous lactose samples using a calibration equation generated from an independent set of 17 samples. The results were found to be accurate to within 1% w/w amorphous content. Dynamic vapor sorption quantification relates the mass of water sorbed and subsequently desorbed during the crystallization process with the amount of amorphous material originally contained within the sample. It was possible to quantitatively detect as little as 1 mg of amorphous content in the sample.

To investigate the influence of the temperature at which adsorption takes place and the temperature at which the adsorbed surface is studied on the polarity of Poloxamer adsorbed to a hydrophobic surface. The implication is that changes in surface nature of adsorbed Poloxamer may subsequently be related to functionality, such as changes in opsonisation of Poloxamer coated latex in animals.\r\nMethods. The surface energies of Poloxamer surfactant have been calculated following adsorption to silanised glass plates. The adsorption to the plates was undertaken at a range of concentrations and at different controlled temperatures. The contact angles were measured using three different liquids on each surface, at a range of controlled temperatures. The surface energies were calculated using the harmonic mean and the acid-base models, via Wilhelmy plate contact angle measurements. These data were compared with previously published adsorption and hydrophobic interaction chromatography studies.\r\nResults. The apolar surface energy term remained consistent, but the polar contribution (which was totally of the electron donor type) changed depending upon the temperature of adsorption (and to a lesser extent the temperature at which the surface energy was measured). The polar nature was most elevated at the critical micelle concentration/ temperature. The data are consistent with estimates of surface hydrophobicity made using hydrophobic interaction chromatography.\r\nConclusions. It is argued that the changes in surface energy, which result from the different adsorption conditions, can be expected to influence the functionality of the adsorbed coat, especially for application such as drug targeting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carthew, D.L","Buckton, G.","Parsons, G.E.","Poole, S."],"dc:date":"1996","doi":"10.1023/A","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109207,"sim:weight":0.339082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5851575,"sim:weight":0.324818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890995,"sim:weight":0.303577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98837,"sim:weight":0.301276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.28951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146860,"sim:weight":0.273856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99020,"sim:weight":0.257147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108054,"sim:weight":0.256945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84924,"sim:weight":0.256668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108058,"sim:weight":0.255883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84820,"sim:weight":0.247165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24121,"sim:weight":0.24296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85877,"sim:weight":0.238944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.224331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108488,"sim:weight":0.215792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.213642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795349,"sim:weight":0.204619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930758,"sim:weight":0.202274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584831,"sim:weight":0.186132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98452,"sim:weight":0.183274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The purpose of the work is to study the adsorption of Oleic acid and Span 85 (materials frequently used in aerosols as surfactants) onto partially amorphous and essentially crystalline salbutamol sulphate, attempting to understand the behaviour of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and observing whether there were any differences in adsorption behaviour and if this could be related to the surface properties of the powder.\r\nMethods. Isothermal titration microcalorimetry was the principal technique used to measure the adsorption behaviour of surfactants to salbutamol sulphate. A Malvern particle size analyzer was also employed to provide size data on the interactions between the surfactant and powder suspensions.\r\nResults. The calorimetric data revealed that surfactant adsorption to the crystalline micronised powder (78% RH and aged dry sample) produced significant exotherms, whereas adsorption to the partially amorphous micronised powder resulted in small heat responses. The differences in adsorption behaviour to the partially crystalline and crystalline surfaces resulted in changes in aggregation behaviour.\r\nConclusions. The stability of MDIs varies depending on the water content, crystallinity and surface composition of the powder.

II. Studies on Anionic, Cationic, and Unionisable Polymers","bibo:abstract":"Surface energies of carbopol, chitosan, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and poly(HEMA) were assessed from contact angle and surface tension experiments. The surface energy was considered in terms of an apolar Lifshitz-van der Waals term and a polar acid-base term, which in turn is divided into electron donor and electron receptor (Lewis acid-Lewis base) contributions. Using these surface energy terms the interaction of dry and hydrated polymer with mucin in the presence of either artificial gastric or intestinal fluid, or saline was predicted. The predictions were related to measured forces of detachment. There was a significant difference between the surface energy on dry and hydrated HPC and also for carbopol; for the other polymers either the surface energy of the hydrated material was not detectable, or the effect of hydration was minimal. There were good correlations between mucoadhesive strength and the calculated free energies of interaction between mucin and polymer in the presence of each of the fluids, for each individual polymer. Thus, two trends were observed, one for unionisable and the other for ionisable polymers. It is argued that the increased mucoadhesion seen with ionisable polymers (compared with the predicted value based on results of unionisable polymers) is a direct result of the ionic interaction. No attempt has been made to correct for the ionisation effect, but the surface energy predictions provide insight into the mechanism of the mucoadhesion process. This approach is useful for understanding and predicting interactions between different materials and biological components.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rillosi, M.","Buckton, G."],"dc:date":"1995","doi":"10.1023/A","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.427559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2701937,"sim:weight":0.363155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5727727,"sim:weight":0.309067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108077,"sim:weight":0.308475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146860,"sim:weight":0.287323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99466,"sim:weight":0.27984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84820,"sim:weight":0.26963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.260501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98459,"sim:weight":0.250797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.250688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99020,"sim:weight":0.24924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5841527,"sim:weight":0.241127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2681780,"sim:weight":0.187941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584831,"sim:weight":0.180884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.168314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98452,"sim:weight":0.153408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.137681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99319,"sim:weight":0.133685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The dystrophic muscle cells expressed less voltage-activated K+ (delayed rectifier and non-inactivating delayed rectifier) and inward rectifier channels than the age-matched control cells. However, the resting membrane potential was not significantly different between the control and the DM1 cells.

Several transcription factors that are expressed mainly in precursors of the ventral telencephalon have been shown to control neuronal specification, but it has been unclear whether subtype identity is also specified in these precursors, or if this happens in postmitotic neurons, and whether it involves the same or different factors. SOX1, an HMG box transcription factor, is expressed widely in neural precursors along with the two other SOXB1 subfamily members, SOX2 and SOX3, and all three have been implicated in neurogenesis. SOX1 is also uniquely expressed at a high level in the majority of telencephalic neurons that constitute the ventral striatum (VS). These neurons are missing in Sox1-null mutant mice. In the present study, we have addressed the requirement for SOX1 at a cellular level, revealing both the nature and timing of the defect. By generating a novel Sox1-null allele expressing β-galactosidase, we found that the VS precursors and their early neuronal differentiation are unaffected in the absence of SOX1, but the prospective neurons fail to migrate to their appropriate position. Furthermore, the migration of non-Sox1-expressing VS neurons (such as those expressing Pax6) was also affected in the absence of SOX1, suggesting that Sox1-expressing neurons play a role in structuring the area of the VS. To test whether SOX1 is required in postmitotic cells for the emergence of VS neuronal identity, we generated mice in which Sox1 expression was directed to all ventral telencephalic precursors, but to only a very few VS neurons. These mice again lacked most of the VS, indicating that SOX1 expression in precursors is not sufficient for VS development. Conversely, the few neurons in which Sox1 expression was maintained were able to migrate to the VS. In conclusion, Sox1 expression in precursors is not sufficient for VS neuronal identity and migration, but this is accomplished in postmitotic cells, which require the continued presence of SOX1. Our data also suggest that other SOXB1 members showing expression in specific neuronal populations are likely to play continuous roles from the establishment of precursors to their final differentiation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ekonomou, A.","Kazanis, I.","Malas, S.","Woods, H.","Alifragis, P.","Denaxa, M.","Karagogeos, D.","Constanti, A.","Lovell-Badge, R.","Episkopou, V."],"dc:date":"2005","doi":"10.1371/journal.pbio.0030186.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4879561,"sim:weight":0.322828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4879562,"sim:weight":0.313195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4879607,"sim:weight":0.299864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4881258,"sim:weight":0.274135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880258,"sim:weight":0.262106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4878594,"sim:weight":0.246031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880440,"sim:weight":0.207515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4879986,"sim:weight":0.186163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4868998,"sim:weight":0.173781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.172986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182565,"sim:weight":0.156504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186609,"sim:weight":0.151923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28395,"sim:weight":0.148131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4881009,"sim:weight":0.14501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1577121,"sim:weight":0.138458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4879635,"sim:weight":0.13163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4879092,"sim:weight":0.11848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4876366,"sim:weight":0.11672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4881257,"sim:weight":0.11539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4884974,"sim:weight":0.106197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A study of seven NHS organisations","bibo:abstract":"Background It is well known that many healthcare systems have poor reliability; however, the size and pervasiveness of this problem and its impact has not been systematically established in the UK. The authors studied four clinical systems: clinical information in surgical outpatient clinics, prescribing for hospital inpatients, equipment in theatres, and insertion of peripheral intravenous lines. The aim was to describe the nature, extent and variation in reliability of these four systems in a sample of UK hospitals, and to explore the reasons for poor reliability. \r\n\r\n\r\nMethods Seven UK hospital organisations were involved; each system was studied in three of these. The authors took delivery of the systems\u0027 intended outputs to be a proxy for the reliability of the system as a whole. For example, for clinical information, 100% reliability was defined as all patients having an agreed list of clinical information available when needed during their appointment. Systems factors were explored using semi-structured interviews with key informants. Common themes across the systems were identified. \r\n\r\n\r\nResults Overall reliability was found to be between 81% and 87% for the systems studied, with significant variation between organisations for some systems: clinical information in outpatient clinics ranged from 73% to 96%; prescribing for hospital inpatients 82–88%; equipment availability in theatres 63–88%; and availability of equipment for insertion of peripheral intravenous lines 80–88%. One in five reliability failures were associated with perceived threats to patient safety. Common factors causing poor reliability included lack of feedback, lack of standardisation, and issues such as access to information out of working hours. \r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions Reported reliability was low for the four systems studied, with some common factors behind each. However, this hides significant variation between organisations for some processes, suggesting that some organisations have managed to create more reliable systems. Standardisation of processes would be expected to have significant benefit.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burnett, S.","Franklin, B.D.","Moorthy, K.","Cooke, M.W.","Vincent, C."],"dc:date":"2012","doi":"10.1136/bmjqs-2011-000442.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":241644,"sim:weight":0.386988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99600,"sim:weight":0.282547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.270396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185982,"sim:weight":0.233362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448025,"sim:weight":0.216676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.214121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271238,"sim:weight":0.212033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1655008,"sim:weight":0.206137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.20509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.202563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98998,"sim:weight":0.193494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385794,"sim:weight":0.193476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113160,"sim:weight":0.169344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.167131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.158257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
