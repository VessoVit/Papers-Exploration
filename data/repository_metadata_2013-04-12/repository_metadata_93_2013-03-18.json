Heightened attention to safety management and public concern about terrorism threats and perception of risk has now become a fundamental component of the planning and risk management strategies for sport events. On the basis of appraisal-tendency theory (Lerner \u0026 Keltner, 2001), we investigated effects of anger and fear on risk judgments of 277 attendees at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Attendees who reported being fearful or feeling unsafe at the Games displayed increased risk estimates and associated concerns, whilst respondents expressing defiance and anger produced opposite reactions. Male respondents had less pessimistic risk perceptions than did females, and men were more likely than women to report that the increased security measures detracted from their Olympic Games experience. Nationality had minimal effect on perceptions of risk except in the case of the host country, with Greek respondents reporting fewer concerns for safety but greater awareness of the security measures present at the Games. The discussion focuses on theoretical, methodological and practical implications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tracy Taylor","Kristine Toohey"],"dc:date":"2011-07-20T09:40:31+0100","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The review indicates that the Games have been increasingly used as a trigger for a wide range of urban improvements, although there have been considerable variations in the scale of infrastructural investment and in the public-private sector mix.","bibo:AuthorList":["Routledge","Stephen Essex","Brian Chalkley"],"dc:date":"2011-07-20T10:11:27+0100","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":677101,"sim:weight":0.572273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930486,"sim:weight":0.541185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67025,"sim:weight":0.528376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1925483,"sim:weight":0.475878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45239,"sim:weight":0.389284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67390,"sim:weight":0.251276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10761,"sim:weight":0.243809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.174648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11062,"sim:weight":0.173776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108829,"sim:weight":0.172078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.168017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.161857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108754,"sim:weight":0.156743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107788,"sim:weight":0.136673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98453,"sim:weight":0.114311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.0795231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

(Legtuninosae), is a perennial herb common throughout Britain. Its main pollinators are bumblebees (Bombus spp., Apidae: Hymenoptera). This is a study of the ecological factors which are important to flowering and fruiting in the species, and some of their evolutionary implications. The work was carried out at Wytham Estate, Oxfordshire, U.K., mainly in an ex-arable field (Upper Seeds) and a more established grassland (Lower Seeds Reserve).\nThe literature on self-incompatibility in L. corniculatus is reviewed; there are conflicting reports, but wild material is fundamentally self-incompatible.\nPlants in Upper Seeds are larger than in Lower Seeds Reserve. Comparative data on soil nutrients in the two sites suggests that the cause is the persistence of phosphorus from inorganic fertiliser.\nThere is a positive, linear relationship between plant size, flower production and fruit production. The species regulates investment in flowers mainly at the level of the whole inflorescence, rather\nthan altering number of flowers per inflorescence. Within individuals, there are no consistent trade-offs between number of fruit per infructescence, numbers of seeds per fruit and seed weight.\nWeather patterns only partially explain the flowering phenology of L. corniculatus. Timing of first flowering and peak flowering are correlated but are variable between individuals, and between years for the same individuals. They are not correlated with flowering synchrony. An individual\u0027s flowering pattern does not consistently affect fruit-set; the overriding determinant of fruit production is plant size. Selection is therefore unlikely to be acting on flowering time in this species.\nThe production of large numbers of self-incompatible flowers does not seem to reduce fruit-set; pollinators do not visit enough flowers per foraging trip (perhaps because nectar production is low) for geitonogamy to become a problem.\nSeed predation by larvae of a chalcid wasp, a weevil and a moth differs between individual plants, but not consistently so between years. Seed predation is not consistently correlated with plant size, mean flowers per inflorescence, number of seeds per fruit or seed size. There is no evidence for selection acting on these traits through seed predation. Partially predated seeds are often viable, which may have implications for seedling demography. Seed predation and flowering phenology are not defmitively linked, strengthening the argument that flowering time is not adaptive in this species.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ollerton, J"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26921,"sim:weight":0.311352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108770,"sim:weight":0.280779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.264881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.264881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62357,"sim:weight":0.249608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61679,"sim:weight":0.214747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60875,"sim:weight":0.21078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.20413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269922,"sim:weight":0.201313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26363,"sim:weight":0.196932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.194939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":380889,"sim:weight":0.179063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62279,"sim:weight":0.175852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.17581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61872,"sim:weight":0.173331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384949,"sim:weight":0.168653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108157,"sim:weight":0.164462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59983,"sim:weight":0.163207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385587,"sim:weight":0.120839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At the same time, however, the Olympics accentuate nationalist and patriotic sentiment, especially in host-nations. Nationalist conviction must be conceptually differentiated from support for the national government. Indeed, we suggest that one of the tasks of governments of Olympic host cities is to manage strong nationalist emotions in order that they support the public diplomacy efforts associated with the Olympic Games. In this paper, American and Japanese media responses to the interplay of China\u0027s 2008 Olympics public diplomacy efforts and Chinese nationalism are comparatively analyzed for each of three periods: 1) the international torch relay; 2) the 2008 Sichuan earthquake; 3) the Olympic Games. Our findings suggest that in the West, the Chinese nationalism that was prompted by a controversial torch relay overpowered other aspects of the Games and that thus the Olympic Games ultimately gave new power to familiar discourses emphasizing a fear of China. In Japan, on the other hand, the Olympics presented modest, albeit important, new opportunities to test and promote positive portrayals of Sino-Japanese relations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Routledge","Christopher J.

Over the last 25 years, there has been a significant growth in the importance of sports science in assisting, improving, and monitoring athlete preparation for the Olympic Games. Most individual athletes and teams will have several sport scientists who are integral to both the preparation phase and at the Olympic Games themselves. In this special issue, we have brought together a number of review papers from several disciplines with a coherent focus on optimizing preparation for Olympic competition. More specifically, the papers in this issue cover fatigue management, the influence of technology, skill acquisition, physiological monitoring, talent identification and development, and psychological preparation. What is clear from the literature is that despite the increased involvement from the sport sciences, there is still a considerable lack of information on Olympic athletes with most of the literature describing good, but not Olympic, athletes. The gathering of detailed information on Olympic athletes is difficult due to the risk of disrupting preparation programmes, the very small number of participants, and the statistical difficulties in assessing worthwhile change at this elite standard of competition. In particular, these difficulties make the evaluation of different preparation strategies and the associated advice given to athletes and coaches extremely problematic.","bibo:AuthorList":["Routledge","R.

Through its evolving networks with other urban regimes, Vancouver\u0027s growth machine provides a ready forum in which local elites can acquire specialized knowledge on new urban entrepreneurial strategies elsewhere. Actors situated in different parts of the local growth machine are establishing various connections with urban regimes in other cities, in what is best understood as a nascent growth machine diaspora. Growth machine and regime theories remain valid in their basic conceptualization and maintain their strength through their adaptability to various contexts, but can be enriched by analyses of policy circuits, travelling theories and learning networks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Routledge","Bjorn Surborg","Rob Van Wynsberghe","Elvin Wyly"],"dc:date":"2011-07-20T09:35:24+0100","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85536,"sim:weight":0.271421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67025,"sim:weight":0.238322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10761,"sim:weight":0.228186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109119,"sim:weight":0.220827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447568,"sim:weight":0.172181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.161026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71910,"sim:weight":0.146197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.110101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The two cases are selected because they reflect contrasting contexts in which the role of women is seen to be embedded in very different ideologies, often referred to simplistically as a religious, and a political ideology respectively. The data through which we scrutinise these two cases are derived from two separate studies. The first is an evaluation study of IOC policy Women in Leadership in the Olympic Movement. In 1996 the IOC adopted a set of minimum targets in relation to the proportion of executive decision-making positions in National Olympic Committees and International Federations which women should hold (10% by 2000, and 20% by 2004). This paper draws on an evaluation of the achievement of these targets commissioned by the IOC from Loughborough University. We focus here on the representation of Muslim women in NOC Executive Committees. The vehicle for discussing the second case is an on-going study of the role of women in state and Olympic sport organisations in China, which has involved case studies of women in senior positions in the Chinese system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Routledge","Yi Wen Chin","Ian Henry","Fan Hong"],"dc:date":"2011-07-20T09:58:51+0100","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108193,"sim:weight":0.355975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.312189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.299357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108302,"sim:weight":0.249099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.244591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.223985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.22294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23349,"sim:weight":0.215581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98927,"sim:weight":0.21428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.200072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107298,"sim:weight":0.195424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56993,"sim:weight":0.183814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85449,"sim:weight":0.182804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50146,"sim:weight":0.179153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109140,"sim:weight":0.154535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Origin of the Date for the First Olympiad","bibo:abstract":"This essay explores the origin of the date of 776 bc for the first Olympiad. That date was established by Hippias of Elis c.400 bc when he compiled the first complete list of Olympic victors. Contrary to what one might expect, Hippias did not arrive at the date of 776 on the basis of written records pertaining to the Olympics or to Olympic victors. Instead, he calculated the date of the first Olympiad by associating that Olympiad with a famous Spartan lawgiver named Lycurgus, who was a member of one of the Spartan royal families and who was believed to have helped organize the Olympic Games. Hippias used a list of Spartan kings to determine the number of generations between his own time and that of Lycurgus. He then assigned a fixed number of years to each generation and ended up with a date for Lycurgus and hence the first Olympiad. The inaccuracies inherent in this approach mean that the date of 776 for the first Olympiad is at best an approximation.

However, despite\u0027 the increasing economic and social importance of the UK hotel industry, its development has been largely neglected. Therefore, this thesis set out to explore the development of big business in the hotel industry through the study of M\u0026A activities.\nThis study employs the multiple case study approach (four UK hotel companies), using M\u0026A theory as the theoretical framework; extensive historical secondary data and semi-structured interviews were carried out for the study, covering a period of 26 years. The analysis was conducted by synthesising data with the M\u0026A theory, in terms of two levels, organisational motives and macro environmental factors. The findings confirm those in the existing literature on what is encompassed by the term big business and the part played by M\u0026A activity in the creation of big business. They also suggest that in the hotel industry the\nacquisition of brand name and brand rights is an important motive, one which has been neglected in the general M\u0026A literature discussion. These findings added several new dimensions to big business concepts, through illuminating the role of brand and brand right acquisition in the context of the UK hotel industry. This thesis confirms the utility of deploying the wide range and large quantity of publicly available historical secondary information, which is rarely used. In addition, the application of a qualitative and longitudinal approach, applied to management theory, has broadened the research agenda in the study of hotel business, business history and business management theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Quek, M"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.299474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.227886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.214992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.214407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340559,"sim:weight":0.197783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271238,"sim:weight":0.160142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Though a considerable body of general literature exists on women in the labour market, including women in engineering and women in construction, there is a lack of knowledge about women in civil engineering specifically. Present attitudes are largely based on unproven assumptions unsupported by empirical data. By examining the career choice of the group, the aims of the thesis were to examine\nthe factors affecting career choice of women civil engineers; to extend the knowledge base and to test some of the current thinking about women in engineering and construction.\nFour objectives were formulated. These concerned the initial reasons for the career choice, differences in male and female choices, whether there is a relationship between college experiences and career choice and whether there is a relationship between career expectations and career choice. These objectives were explored in a comprehensive literature review, and in an extensive series of interviews followed by a national survey of all final year women civil engineering students and an equivalent number of final year male civil engineering students. The data was analyzed by testing a number of hypotheses for each of the four objectives using advanced statistical techniques.\nThe results of the study showed that there were a very large number of complex factors involved in women\u0027s career choice. Of particular interest were the differences in the career choices of male and female civil engineering students, that some college experiences of women were related to career choice and that generally the beliefs women had of a career in civil engineering did not appear to be related to their choice of sector of civil engineering.\nThe thesis, in its original research, has clearly made an important contribution to the study of women in civil engineering and there is ample scope for future research projects to build on this original research. These findings have important implications for career advisors, teachers, lecturers in higher education as well as employers in the construction industry.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilkinson, Suzanne"],"dc:date":"1993","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108354,"sim:weight":0.330193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.239917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108904,"sim:weight":0.223176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.214746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86024,"sim:weight":0.206057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23990,"sim:weight":0.199591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109073,"sim:weight":0.191809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108416,"sim:weight":0.185284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57352,"sim:weight":0.181496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.158478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98717,"sim:weight":0.140605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The focus of the thesis is the mathematical and numerical aspects of reconstructing the impedance image from the measured data (the reconstruction problem).\nThe reconstruction problem is mathematically difficult and most reconstruction algorithms are computationally intensive. Many of the potential applications of EIT in medical diagnosis and industrial process control depend upon rapid reconstruction of images. The aim of this investigation is to find algorithms and numerical techniques that lead to fast reconstruction while respecting the real mathematical difficulties\ninvolved.\nA general framework for Newton based reconstruction algorithms is developed which describes a large number of the reconstruction algorithms used by other investigators. Optimal experiments are defined in terms of current drive and voltage measurement patterns and it is shown that adaptive current reconstruction algorithms are a special case of their use. This leads to a new reconstruction algorithm using optimal experiments which is considerably faster than other methods of the Newton type.\nA tomograph is tested to measure the magnitude of the major sources of error in the data used for image reconstruction. An investigation into the numerical stability of reconstruction algorithms identifies the resulting uncertainty in the impedance image. A new data collection strategy and a numerical forward model are developed which minimise the effects of, previously, major sources of error.\nA reconstruction program is written for a range of Multiple Instruction Multiple Data, (MIMD), distributed memory, parallel computers. These machines promise high computational power for low cost and so look promising as components in medical tomographs. The performance of several reconstruction algorithms on these computers is analysed in detail.","bibo:AuthorList":["Paulson, K"],"dc:date":"1992","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1568090,"sim:weight":0.575759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The discussion necessarily involves an examination of traditional integration theories, but it concentrates primarily on policy\nanalysis which is based on extensive empirical research and supported by secondaiy literature and theoretical deliberations. The major research for this project was carried out between 1990 and 1994, in the form of mail surveys, interviews, non-participatory observation and scrutiny of\ndocumentation and secondary literature. The empirical approach adopted here is regarded as superior to purely theory-based research, because the former provides more insight into the nature of the European Union than the latter.\nThe thesis consists principally of a discussion of the general nature of the policy process in the European Union, but contains also a more detailed case study on food policy-making. The findings in this study confirm that there is a marked gap between formal policy procedures and the way in which policy is actually carried out Consequently, policy-making in the European Union is very varied and dynamic, and cannot be encapsulated into a single static conceptual framework. The gap is explained in terms of the influence of informal factors on policy-making, namely the involvement of private interests, the varied interpretations of the formal provisions which flourish due to Treaty ambiguities and the mediating effects of manifold political and cultural agendas. The\nactual influence of private interests is difficult to measure, and data are contradictory, but it is nonetheless evident that influence is disproportionately low compared to the extent of consultation\nand lobbying that characterises policy-making in the European Union. However, as far as broad developments are concerned, business and other economic interests have had significant influence on EU developments - but only if their interests did not diverge too markedly from the political priorities of the most senior European politicians. This finding confirms that, despite many bureaucratic and technocratic elements, the European Union is an intensely political system.\nWithin the realm of politics, national self4nterests remain dominant, even though they are constantly challenged and mediated by other political and non-political concertinos. The predominance of national concerns is however constantly reinforced by the hybrid structures of the\nEuropean Union.\nIt is argued in the thesis that empirical policy studies must be embedded in a suitable conceptual framework so that they do not result lii purely descriptive exercises. Therefore, considerable attention has been given to constructing such a framework. The latter is based broadly on policy\nnetworks analysis but emphasises the problems and limitations of this approach and expands the basic concept in order to take account of the idiosyncrasies of the European Union which is a unique political system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boyce, B"],"dc:date":"1995","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99175,"sim:weight":0.453464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85586,"sim:weight":0.386717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99191,"sim:weight":0.325153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98731,"sim:weight":0.316247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98465,"sim:weight":0.26261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The links between these concepts are explored in the context of the ceremonial performance of the audit committee meeting. Consensus, achieved through complex networks among participants, is displayed at the meeting through a process of iterative questioning which demonstrates characteristics of independence among members, validating the consensus reached. Consensus serves to generate comfort which is viewed as a commodity produced by the audit committee and passed on to the main board. Ultimately, the published financial statements, which include evidence of the audit committee\u0027s existence and activity, provide comfort to external providers of finance that the company is maintaining appropriate standards of corporate governance.\nAccording to Cadbury, audit committees contribute to high standards of\ncorporate governance: this study argues that this assertion remains unproven but that audit committees enable companies to present an image of concern about such standards which may be sufficient to establish legitimacy and permit access to resources to secure their survival and expansion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spira, L"],"dc:date":"1998","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108567,"sim:weight":0.556916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85650,"sim:weight":0.463844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.43645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108921,"sim:weight":0.388805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316147,"sim:weight":0.369848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98926,"sim:weight":0.333061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930474,"sim:weight":0.323525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.290794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109146,"sim:weight":0.28658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734375,"sim:weight":0.259406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.250514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.234358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.212476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108914,"sim:weight":0.200812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385475,"sim:weight":0.19719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It begins with a consideration of the philosophical basis for providing protection for such employees. The legal rights of the whistleblowing employee in English law are then considered. In chapter three case law on the duty of confidence is examined and conclusions drawn on its application to employees dismissed for blowing the whistle, with particular reference to whether disclosure of information involves a breach of the employment contract. The general law on unfair dismissal is examined in chapter four to determine the extent to which an\nemployee can claim that a dismissal for raising a concern is unfair. Protection for whistleblowing on specific issues such as race or sex discrimination, and health and safety issues is considered in chapter five.\nInternational standards governing the protection of the right to freedom of expression, in particular Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, are examined in chapter six. Chapter seven comprises a comparative study of the protection available to employees who blow the whistle in the USA, where protection exists for whistleblowers both at a constitutional level and in specific legislation.\nA case study is included in chapter eight in which the position of employees in the National Health Service is examined in detail, with regard to their contractual position and the practical difficulties faced by those who wish to raise concerns about matters at work.\nA fundamental distinction drawn throughout the thesis is between two types of whistleblowing: \"watchdog\" whistleblowing, referring the raising of concerns about immediate threats to health and safety or of serious financial loss; and \"protest\" whistleblowing, referring to the participation of employees in debate on matters that are in the public interest, using specialist informztion gained from their employment. The recognition of these two forms of whistleblowing aids the analysis of the limitations of the legal protection as well as proving useful in the determining the scope of proposed reform.\nThe argument is made that the protection currently available is inadequate and the thesis ends with proposals for legal reform.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vickers, L"],"dc:date":"1996","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

An ideal type of the \u0027esoteric\u0027 core of Mosley\u0027s ideology is used to identify a consistent thread which resolves the contradictions in Mosley\u0027s political agitations into paradoxes. Drawing\non a theory of ideology which distinguishes between its fundamental and operative dimensions, Mosley\u0027s core (fundamental) ideology is depicted ideal typically as the ambition to realize Bntain\u0027s potential for national greatness conceived in a future oriented, modernizing rather than a nostalgic or conservative perspective.\nThe structure of the biography follows the chronological narrative of Mosley\u0027s life, episodically, illuminating it through pivotal moments in his career. Through a textual and contextual analysis of these moments it identifies the performance of the operative dimension of Mosley\u0027s fundamental ideology in order to bring out its internal consistency.

These themes are the myth of the airman, leadership, economics, unemployment, the New Party, the nation and Greater Britain, anti-Semitism and violence, philosophical idealism and the philosophy of apologia.\nThe thesis draws on the vast published textual output from Mosley along with reports of his speeches, supported by many contemporary writings relating to chapter topic. These resources are used to demonstrate and shed light on the esoteric mainspring of Mosley\u0027s politics. In addition the thesis demonstrates and argues in favour of a biographic methodology which does not construct the inner machinations of the subject\u0027s psychology or \u0027mind\u0027 as an explanation of behaviour but looks pragmatically to the significant products of the subject and constructs, ideal typically, a consistent ideological matrix the centre of the subjects politics. This thesis contributes to knowledge of the subject by presenting a pragmatic understanding of Mosley\u0027s political motivations and identifying a consistent core to his political pronouncements. The thesis also brings to biographical studies a phenomenological\nmethodology which dispenses with the postulation of a knowable core personality or \u0027real\u0027 psychological life in order to demonstrate the inner coherence of the subject\u0027s personality for the purpose of historical reconstruction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cook, C"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.331749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.310195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.288739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.288612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.284671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.281076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.252589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108414,"sim:weight":0.247116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931412,"sim:weight":0.244292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.226269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.18224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

South West College* is part of the national pilot scheme for this award initiated by the government in September 1999, which currently involves 56 Local Education Authorities.\nThe aim of this research was to examine the effect of the EMA on participation. retention and achievement in full-time further education courses for young people from low-income households in South West College; and to identify the extent to which a financial incentive can improve post-16 recruitment, retention and results on advanced level (academic and vocational) courses. Theme generating student and staff perceptions were sought on the impact of the EMA. College data were analysed to allow for a comparison of an EMA and non-EMA cohort and any tentative identification of the extent to which remuneration had\naffected student participation, retention and achievement.\nFindings suggest that for full-time advanced level students from low-income backgrounds enrolling on a course in 1999, the EMA may have had a positive effect on retention, but that participation and achievement appeared unaffected in South West College. The findings\ndiffers from the national evaluation results that identify increased levels of both participation and retention, but have yet to comment on achievement. Student and staff perceptions of the EMA were that it is a good idea in further education and that it should help students in paying\nfor additional and indirect educational expenses.\nThe EMA appears to support widening participation and success in further education; however critical evaluation suggests that cultural factors, as well as financial or structural factors, may impact on students\u0027 decisions to participate, stay on and achieve at advanced\nlevel.

If it did exist, did it continue after privatisation and deregulation, or was it substantially reduced or eliminated.\n\nThe methodology of the dissertation is eclectic, so it examined these issues from a number of different perspectives, and its contribution to knowledge is incremental.\n\nIn regard to the bus and coach industry in the newly competitive period following deregulation and privatisation, the major firms emerged almost solely through external rather than organic growth. This went against one of the main aims of privatisation, which was to create a competitive industry of many small-to-medium sized operations. Privatisation and deregulation also failed to stop the decline in passenger numbers, which was another objective of the programme. \n\nIn the case of the UK ports, it is extremely difficult to conclude that the changing ownership constituted a significant factor in port performance and efficiency. Instead, factors such as geographical location and labour market deregulation seems to have had a greater influence on efficiency in the ports. That the measure of liberalisation most associated with privatisation, and that offered the most in terms of potential gains in efficiency, were those on which major concessions had to be made by the Government to win management support for the political process of privatisation. If managerial support for privatisation was absent then process was unlikely to occur.\n\nThe underlying success of deregulation and privatisation in these industries has been in reducing the power of trade unions to obtain rent for their members, which was one of the main, if understated aims of the policy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sealey, R D"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This thesis reviews the growing literature on the subject, especially considering Hochschild\u0027s (1983) concept of emotional labour and the possible emotional demands and impacts of service work. Concepts such as emotional exhaustion, burnout and desensitisation are often referred to in the literature although relatively few researchers draw attention to any more positive effects. This project sought to widen the study of the emotional implications of service work to include the large, but under researched public house sector of Britain\u0027s hospitality industry. This thesis investigates the nature of emotion rules in public houses, how such rules are learnt and identifies a variety of both negative and positive emotional demands of pub work and how workers react to these.\nA single ethnographic study was undertaken within a large chain of public houses. A mixture of participant observation and in-depth interviews provided a rich variety of data resulting in a broad picture of the nature of the emotions within a number of individual public houses within the chain, with the fieldworker taking on the role of an employee in five such units.\nWhen discussing the emotional demands of their work, there was a common assertion among study participants that pubs were rather different to other types of hospitality outlet. This was seen as particularly relevant to the nature of emotion rules, which were influenced by a variety of stakeholders, including management, colleagues, customers and self. The idea that bar staff need to be and be seen to be genuine with customers was often stressed. Although all were able to recall some specific incidents when some surface and deep acting was called for, these were perceived to be exceptions rather than the norm. Some negative emotional aspects were raised by participants, especially relating to dealing with unpleasant customers or situations. More positive \u0027effects\u0027 of emotional labour were also alluded to, with bar staff claiming to enjoy much of their work dealing with customers They described pleasure from satisfying customers and even \u0027enjoying\u0027 dealing with less pleasant ones when they felt they could maintain an element of control over potentially damaging situations.\nThe thesis takes a reflexive approach to the topic being investigated. This is felt to be particularly important given the participatory nature of ethnography and the generally tacit nature of emotions and the management of emotion. The researcher discusses influences, experiences, problems and successes from a personal perspective, helping readers to understand the personal research journey undertaken and come to their own conclusions regarding the value of this piece of work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sandiford, P"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99136,"sim:weight":0.484101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82088,"sim:weight":0.445959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388776,"sim:weight":0.349951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.298327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513358,"sim:weight":0.287583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.280296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.259805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.258357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.253154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.244464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.243784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99226,"sim:weight":0.224297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Based on a constructionist, sociological approach it focuses on their personal diverse experiences and perspectives. It contributes to current sociological debates about\nchildhood, contemporary morality and individualisation and considers the relevance of these for social policy. The literature review indicates that foster carers are undervalued and marginalised, precariously balanced at the edges of the several (conceptual) worlds of caring, family, \"public\" bureaucracy and \"private\" home life.\nThese ambiguities are considered through 46 in-depth interviews of a heterogeneous sample which reveal lives full of paradoxes and conflict. Carers justify this because of the needs of the children who are frequently considered to be worth any sacrifice and regarded as priceless in terms of their meaningfulness and emotional value. Yet foster children are bureaucratised - their carers have limited autonomy and are compromised in most areas of their lives by the children\u0027s \"differences\". Anti-social behaviour is excused by the carers, and any blame attached to the children\u0027s birth families and the social service departments.\nCarers create their own rewards through the children. They position themselves, in relation to the children, as potentially very powerful in terms of the possibility of changing and thereby \"saving\" them via a particularistic loving tie. The official role of most carers is to prepare each child for a move, preferably back to their biological family. But the carers\u0027 love of and commitment to each child may be in tension with the maintenance of children\u0027s contact with their birth relatives and thus create a dilemma for all involved.\nFoster care provides an identity of care. By contrast with debates on contemporary morality which posit a potential collision between the two ethics of care of self and of child care it is argued that, for foster carers, these are mutually compatible. An ethic of self care is served through their devotion to the children\u0027s needs. Caring reassures foster carers that\nthey count.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nutt, L"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"L M Nutt. (2002).

The parochial nature of its administration, combined with a paucity of systematic local or regional studies has meant that although many excellent general surveys of welfare provision have been published,\nthe issue of the plight of sick poor is either relegated to a mere adjunct of wider relief policy, or absent from the secondary literature altogether. Through the employment of a systematic study of the under-researched county of Oxfordshire, this thesis will aim to exploit the research agenda that has increasingly sought to re-engage with the lives of the sick poor themselves, as they navigated the contested terrain of the Old Poor Law.\nIn order to undertake such a study, it is important to first determine the scale and scope of medical relief delivered by the parish to the poor during the period, and so a systematic quantitative analysis of a sample of Oxfordshire parishes forms a necessary starting point of the research. The key aim of this quantification is to establish the centrality of medical relief within the general architecture of the locally administered Poor Law. The thesis will then move into more qualitative territory, employing material that will help unlock our understanding of the medical landscapes which abounded throughout Oxfordshire during the tenure of the Old Poor Law, and how they impacted upon and shaped the relief of the sick poor.\nThrough an evaluation of the supply of medical relief, this thesis will gauge the extent to which the sick poor of Oxfordshire were tied into wider relief paradigms such as the medical marketplace and general narratives of modernity.\nThe real originality of the thesis however lies in its engagement with the\nactors who shaped medical relief policy within the multitude of Welfare Republics across Oxfordshire. At heart, the Old Poor Law was always conditioned by notions of exclusion, and through an exposition of the process of relief, the concluding two chapters in particular aim to add much original insight into the wider research agenda that has emerged concerning the complex negotiation strategies that were employed\nby both sides of the relief equation. Such novel approaches to the architecture and \u0027system\u0027 of relief within the parish represent an important contribution to the nascent research agenda coalescing around the medical relief of the sick poor. Further, such studies are important as they represent a move away from a historiography that has tended to obscure the point that medical relief was never merely a question of\napplication and approval during the supposedly generous \u0027welfare state in miniature\u0027 that has come to characterise the Old Poor Law. It is, therefore, the aim of this thesis to exploit these new avenues of research which consider the plight of the sick poor as worthy of study in their own right, whilst also contributing to the emergent research agenda that seeks to locate the experience of sickness as a central component of the English Old Poor Law.","bibo:AuthorList":["Philipson, T"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.257769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998629,"sim:weight":0.217971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.214751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.190816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.189549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109025,"sim:weight":0.183534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

All gibbon species are protected by Indonesian law and cannot legally be kept as pets. Gibbons rarely breed successfully in Indonesian zoos, and the vast majority of animals present in these collections originate from the illegal wildlife trade, having been donated to the zoos by the public or brought in by Indonesian authorities after being confiscated from dealers or private owners. Gibbons in rescue and rehabilitation centres also derive largely from donations or confiscations. The surveys provide insight into the volume and species composition of gibbons in trade. All 7 species of gibbon that occur naturally in Indonesia were observed, with the highest numbers (130 ind.) being for the siamang Symphalangus syndactylus. About 100 ind. each for Bornean and Sumatran agile gibbons Hylobates albibarbis and H. agilis, Javan gibbon H. moloch and Müller’s gibbon H. muelleri were present, but only a handful of white-handed H. lar and Kloss’ gibbons H. klossi. No gibbons that do not occur in Indonesia were recorded. Numbers of the different species in trade appear to be positively related to their numbers in the wild. Trade in Sumatra and Borneo appears to be confined to species naturally occurring there, but all species are traded on Java. About twice as many gibbons were taken in by the respective institutions following confiscations by the Indonesian authorities compared to gibbons received as donations by the public. However, prosecution of offenders is rare, and given the large scale of the gibbon trade, we urge the Indonesian authorities to increase efforts to enforce wildlife protection laws.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nijman, V","Martinez, C","Shepherd, C"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":62227,"sim:weight":0.179871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60875,"sim:weight":0.169649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52469,"sim:weight":0.163519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108120,"sim:weight":0.162225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60055,"sim:weight":0.158628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86207,"sim:weight":0.158581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.136362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.136362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89658,"sim:weight":0.132255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316357,"sim:weight":0.123065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.116436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58019,"sim:weight":0.114109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108926,"sim:weight":0.108408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15174,"sim:weight":0.102744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60872,"sim:weight":0.0941687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108766,"sim:weight":0.0883796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The target words and pseudo-words are derived forms that contain non-stressed schwa vowels. Although differently pronounced the latter vowels are spelled consistently with those in the stems of the base forms.\nPrimes were either oral or oral plus written. Priming effects were assessed by comparison with a non-primed condition.\nNo priming effects were detected in 6- and 7-year-old children. Both priming conditions produced a significantly higher level of correct spelling in children 8 and 9 years of age. Oral plus written primes allowed older children to use morphological spellings in both words and pseudo-words. These results suggest that older children can use implicit morphological information to spell schwa vowels morphologically.\nStudy 2 examined the concurrent relations between morphological awareness and morphologically based spellings. Two issues were considered: consistency in the spelling of stems in base and derived (or pseudo-derived) forms and discrimination in the spelling of words and pseudo-words ending in homophone suffixes. Children from grades 1 to 3 (6 to 8-year-olds; N \u003d 184) participated in the study.\nIt was found that there was a significant relation between morphological awareness and consistency in the spelling of stems in Base - Pseudo-derived stimuli, after controlling for differences in grade and IQ. Mixed results were found for the spelling of homophone suffixes. The only significant prediction obtained was between morphological awareness\nand discrimination in the spelling of the words ending in the homophone suffixes \u0027-esa\u0027/ \u0027-eza\u0027.\nIn Study 3, the relation between morphological awareness and consistency in the spelling of stems is analysed, longitudinally. Children from grades 1 to 4 (6- to 9-year-olds; N \u003d 184) were assessed in three sessions (A, B and C) each separated by six months.\nThe results showed that some of the measures of morphological awareness could predict consistency in the spelling of stems over periods of six and of twelve months, after controlling for shared variance with Grade and IQ. This is indicative of a strong link between morphological awareness and consistency in the spelling of stems.\nIn study 4, the relation between morphological awareness and discrimination in the spelling of words and pseudo-words ending in the homophone suffixes \u0027-esa\u0027/ \u0027-eza\u0027 is analysed. The suffix \u0027-esa\u0027 forms nouns that indicate origin or provenance. The homophone \u0027-eza\u0027 forms abstract nouns. The participants and design were the same as in\nthe previous study.\nIt was found that the younger children tended to use one spelling for the two suffixes.\nThen, when alternative spellings were used, their assignment was unsystematic. Systematic assignment was rare even in the older children.\nSome measures of morphological awareness in session B, accounted for unique variance in the discrimination scores measured in session C, after controlling for differences explained by grade and IQ.\nIn study 5, the relation between morphological awareness and discrimination in the spelling of words and pseudo-words ending in the homophone suffixes \u0027-ice\u0027/ \u0027-isse\u0027 is analysed. The suffix \u0027-ice\u0027 forms abstract nouns. The homophone \u0027-isse\u0027 is used in the subjunctive of some verbs. The participants and design were the same as before.\nCorrect assignment of suffixes followed the same pattern of spelling phases as described in the previous study. Significant predictions were found between sessions A and B, B and C and A and C. Some of the morphological awareness measures strongly predicted discrimination scores, after controlling for the effects of grade and IQ.\nStudy 6 examines the spelling of older children (Grades 5, 7 and 9) and adults (student-teachers and in-service-teachers (N total \u003d 107). The aim was to find out when consistency in the spelling of stems and discrimination of homophone suffixes were eventually achieved and whether the adult participants were aware of the morphological rules that make discrimination predictable.\nConsistency in the spelling of stems was only systematic in grade nine. Discrimination of the homophone suffixes \u0027-esa\u0027/ \u0027-eza\u0027 was not completely systematic after sixteen years of instruction (student teachers) Discrimination of words ending in the homophone suffixes \u0027-ice\u0027/ \u0027-isse\u0027 was systematic by student teachers. Discrimination in the spelling of pseudo-words was not achieved. Spelling justifications were asked from teachers. These revealed that the knowledge of morphological rules was scarce, in complete or absent.\nThis thesis provides first evidence that older children can use morphological information that is provided, implicitly, through priming. It also shows that achieving consistency in the spelling of morphologically related stems is a long process. Systematic discrimination of homophone suffixes is even harder. However, morphological awareness was generally\nfound to contribute strongly to the spelling, and to predict spelling outcomes, even after stringent controls for grade and IQ.\nFurther research is necessary to examine how children develop morphologically based spellings that cannot be anchored first, in a stable phonological matrix.\nThese results also suggest that instruction with a strong morphological rationale might significantly enhance spelling development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rosa, J M S"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research addressed two main research questions:\n(1) How have the perceptions of giftedness changed for Lithuanian\nteachers following a professional development programme in gifted\neducation at Kaunas Technological University?\n(2) How did the teachers at a Lithuanian basic school who attended the\nprofessional development implement a gifted student identification\nprocedure at their school?\nThe objective of the professional development programme was for Lithuanian teachers to collaborate on a definition and list of characteristics of giftedness in order to design a gifted student identification process. Qualitative evidence for perceptions of giftedness, gathered from pre-and post-surveys, interviews and questionnaires, indicated that these Lithuanian teachers changed their thinking\nabout giftedness and the identification of gifted learners. Mind Mapping was used to illustrate these conceptual and thematic changes. NVivo was then employed to validate the findings, analyse and code the data. Ninety one percent of Lithuanian teachers changed their thinking about giftedness after the professional development programme.\nThe second study used Fullan’s Four Stage Model of Educational Change to analyse the change process at a case study school. The case study school teachers who attended the professional development implemented a gifted student identification process. Qualitative methodologies involved observations, discussions, interviews, and study of written records and documentation. Journaling, audio and videotaping were used to record information. The case study school screening committee identified 26% of pupils as ‘gifted’ from parent-, teacher-, peer-, and self-nomination. Teachers said that they felt empowered to differentiate the curriculum for gifted pupils at their school.

Whatever the situation, the failure to co-operate challenges a democratic society and basic human rights. The problem\noccurs when individual primary care agencies either:\n• try to do on their own what can only be achieved by co-operation, or\n• fail to do anything because, in their view, the client\u0027s needs should be met by some other agency, or\n• only do what they can do on their own.\nThe purpose of this study is to establish:\n• to what extent improvements in inter-agency co-operation would help agencies work more effectively with young people variously described as falling through the net, or on the margins of an agency\u0027s responsibility\n• what factors contribute to these improvements\n• what characterises effective models of inter-agency practice.\nThe study finds that over the last thirty years, the legislative framework surrounding inter-agency co-operation for young people provides few examples of structures or procedures requiring agencies to co-operate. Where these exist, they have been set up in response to needs or crises of pressing concern at the time. Research into the practice of inter-agency work shows that successful inter-agency projects set up to meet the needs of those at risk of falling through the net follow a characteristic pattern. This led to the construction of a model based on the idea that successful inter-agency practice depends on the existence of collaborative activity at three interconnected levels: policy and planning; implementation, case work, research and training; networking/liaison. Projects supported at all three levels are more likely to be successful and survive than those which are not. This pattern can be replicated in different contexts and with different client groups to ensure effective co-ordination and redistribution of resources, and that\na balance is held between preventative and proactive work. The model\u0027s key elements enable it to structure communication pathways within and between agencies, to co-ordinate activity in relation to a particular issue, to develop the interpersonal skills of participants and to provide\nfeedback to policy makers. The research concludes that:\n• formal structures promoting inter-agency collaboration encourage agencies to innovate and to provide co-ordinated services for young people needing more support than can be provided by any one of them\n• inter-agency work has become a new area of professional and para professional expertise\n• models designed to help agencies meet the needs of people at risk can be applied to other projects set up to solve complex problems involving more than one department.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roaf, C"],"dc:date":"1999","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

All international trade in primates is regulated through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), to which all but 2 primate range countries are signatory. The last 15 years has seen a linear increase in the export of live primates (each year 3500 more individuals are exported), with China being, numerically, the largest exporter. While the trade in live primates worldwide involves tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of individuals a year, the trade in dead primates involves millions of animals a year.

Whether due to economic shifts, changing political landscapes, imperial ambitions, or even simply personal tragedy, many families found themselves fractured and disoriented by the growth and later fissure of a larger Atlantic world. Such dislocation posed considerable challenges to all individuals who viewed orderly family relations as both a general and a personal ideal.\nThe more fortunate individuals who thus found themselves \u0027all at sea\u0027 were able to use family letters, with attendant emphases on familiarity, sensibility, and credit, in order to remain connected in times and places of considerable disconnection. Portraying the family as a unified, affectionate, and happy entity in such letters provided a means of surmounting concerns about societies fractured by physical distance, global wars, and increasing social stratification. It could also provide social and economic leverage to individual men and women in certain circumstances.\nSarah Pearsall explores the lives and letters of these families, revealing the sometimes shocking stories of those divided by sea.

This article offers a novel critique of the concept and its value for a critical social science of globalization. It argues that received notions of GCS are rooted in territorialist and societalist paradigms of the social and should not be used to subvent an account of globalization located in the dynamics of trans and even post-societal and post-national connections and the kind of world they intimate. GCS and variants such as cosmopolitanism are examined to evaluate whether they can provide a way of bridging the gap between territorialist and societalist assumptions about the organization of the social and the increasingly post-societal and post-territorial nature of the world. The aim is to avoid the inviting, but ultimately misleading sleight of hand through which GCS is revealed as the boundary-less equivalent of civil society, but with all the normative and aesthetic baggage of the latter still attached. The article ends with a critical discussion of the claim that globalization processes of connection are producing a networked globality in which reflexive agency is not lost. To recognize this requires a radical take on networks and their ontologies and being skeptical about much of the received sociology of globalization.","bibo:AuthorList":["Axford, B"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631263,"sim:weight":0.311522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41322,"sim:weight":0.305041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631615,"sim:weight":0.286987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.267442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.267432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.26412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.261608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.243845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.241134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631487,"sim:weight":0.238838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.23275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.23275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.229607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222965,"sim:weight":0.227017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.200299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76873,"sim:weight":0.187807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99341,"sim:weight":0.182421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447847,"sim:weight":0.180233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77162,"sim:weight":0.179942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447821,"sim:weight":0.177216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this paper we show that we can construct a globally optimal solution in either the horizontal or vertical direction using a single graph cut. The solution takes into account both edges in the image, and the coherence of the resulting superpixel regions. We show that our method outperforms existing algorithms for computing superpixel lattices.

The case studies found that concerns about\nstigma, confidentiality, damaged career prospects and beliefs about the nature of the support provided all impacted on students\u0027 willingness to seek help. Sources of social support included friends, family, student officers, academic, residential and administrative staff. Psychological support came from university counsellors and National Health Service\npsychotherapists. General Practitioners provided the first line of medical support, with psychiatrists and other mental health professionals becoming involved with the more severe cases. There were gaps between the different levels of support, concerns about the difficulty in accessing secondary and tertiary levels of care, and sometimes mutual\nsuspicion between different types of supporters.\nThe distinctions between social, psychological and medical approaches to mental health which tend to be polarised in the literature, were not articulated so forcefully by the majority of the respondents.

It establishes a principled basis for determining the proper scope of religious freedom at work, and considers the interaction of freedom of religion with the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of religion.\n\nDiscrimination on grounds of religion and belief within the workplace raises many complex and contested issues, not least because of the multi-faceted nature of religious discrimination. Discrimination can occur where secular employers refuse to employ or accommodate religious employees, as well as where religious groups refuse to employ those of a different religion, or those of the same religion whose interpretation or practice of the faith differs. Adding to the complexity is the fact that freedom of religion is protected as a fundamental human right which may be enjoyed by both religious individuals and religious groups. Although it is not an absolute right, its importance to individuals means that religious freedom may warrant a degree of protection in the work context.\n\nThe book begins with a study of the basis for protecting religious freedom and considers the extent to which that right should be exercised in specialised context of the workplace. It takes a comparative approach, considering the position in other common law jurisdictions, and within the European Union. It locates the debate surrounding these issues within a philosophical and theoretical framework in which the importance of freedom of religion, and its role within the workplace is fully debated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vickers, L"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This new method does not require the solution of traditional eigen value based problems to reduce computational time during optimization, but are instead based on computation of Arnoldi vectors belonging to the induced Krylov Subspaces. The key idea of constructing such a reduced order model is to remove the uncontrollable, unobservable and weakly controllable, observable parts without affecting the noise transfer function of the coupled system. In a unified approach, the validity of the optimization framework is demonstrated on a constrained composite plate/prism cavity coupled system. For the fully coupled, vibro–acoustic, unconstrained optimization problem, the design variables take the form of stacking sequences of a composite structure enclosing the acoustic cavity. The goal of the optimization is to reduce sound pressure levels at the driver’s ear location. It is shown that by incorporating the reduced order modelling procedure within the optimization framework, a significant reduction in computational time can be obtained, without any loss of accuracy—when compared to the direct method. The method could prove as a valuable tool to analyze and optimize complex coupled structural–acoustic systems, where, in addition to fast analysis, a fine frequency resolution is often required.","bibo:AuthorList":["Puri, R","Morrey, D"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Presently, the main environmental problem in the world is the Western way of life. Today, many realise that Western culture, and the educational systems that support and reflect its beliefs, must transform. It is time to look outside for a better way, and this chapter seeks inspiration from an early challenge to Western globalised culture. This, the sattvic alternative, seems to suggest a path that leads through the current crises of environment, society and sustainability, towards a better, happier and more spiritually fulfilling future. Reviewers have asked if this sattvic alternative is a real option for secular education or just something appropriate to religious studies. The answer is that the approach is appropriate to any education that has deep concern for the person, his or her wellbeing and the wellbeing of all in the future. A sattvic curriculum recognises the ontological unity of everything, emphasises the learners\u0027 kinship with all living spirits and casts the learners\u0027 role as service in the world.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haigh, M"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.297303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.287143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85785,"sim:weight":0.273216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108987,"sim:weight":0.255597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.254508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.237458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.235089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176792,"sim:weight":0.230018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99118,"sim:weight":0.226506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999497,"sim:weight":0.225547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85308,"sim:weight":0.223644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99226,"sim:weight":0.197071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.193407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.19056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These were local statutory governance bodies with responsibility to deliver and develop primary care and to improve the health of their local population: complex functions requiring collaboration with a range of organisations and agencies.\nThe central aim of this study was to investigate whether and how PCG/Ts developed and facilitated collaboration within primary care, and between it and other NHS and non-NHS bodies, and to identify factors which enabled and inhibited collaboration. Using a theoretical framework which draws on a critical realist tradition, an approach was adopted to the analysis of organisational change which was attentive not only to rational, incremental processes of change but which took into account the political, cultural and economic context in which PCG/Ts operated. A key element of this context was the strong resemblance between New Labour\u0027s prominent `third way\u0027 discourse of collaboration and the defining characteristics of a network mode of governance: trust, loyalty, reciprocity and voluntariness. Inductive and deductive approaches were combined to test and develop theory about the interactions between context and organisational form, using multiple qualitative methods within a longitudinal nested case study.\nThe study demonstrated that the locality-wide base of PCG/Ts, their explicit health improvement remit, budgetary arrangements and the presence of clinicians on their governing bodies were aspects of their organisational forms which equipped them to facilitate collaboration. However, over time, certain contradictions became apparent in New Labour\u0027s approach to organising the NHS which undermined many of the PCG/T\u0027s collaborative processes. This thesis argues that the alignment of the third way discourse with a network mode of governance exemplified \u0027symbolic politics. \u0027 What was presented as a rational response to complex social problems and fragmentation of public services, was in fact largely a pragmatic political manoeuvre designed to distance itself from the perceived failure of previous administrations\u0027 hierarchy and market modes of governance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chisholm, A M"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This suggests a polarization of art\u0027s aesthetic and social dimensions. A deeper understanding of the relation between these dimensions is found in the work of Marcuse, Bloch and Adorno. Marcuse, in his early work, sees art as serving the needs of bourgeois society by displacing ideas of a better world to an independent aesthetic realm; Bloch sees art as giving form to hope, shaping a recurrent aspiration for a better\nworld; Adorno sees the tension between the aesthetic and social dimensions of art as unresolvable, and, like Marcuse in his later work, sees art\u0027s autonomy as a space of criticality. But, as Bloch argues, conditions for change are noncontemporaneous, fostering culture which is both progressive and regressive. In this respect, Gablik\u0027s appropriations of other cultures may be seen as regressive, whilst Lippard\u0027s concern for locality offers art a basis for progressive intervention. The introduction of the local, as a point of reference alongside the aesthetic and social, leads to consideration of three cases of art practice: Common Ground\u0027s Parish Maps (1986-96), the Visions of Utopia Festival coordinated by the Artists Agency (1996-8), and 90% Crude (1996--), a project by PLATFORM in London.\nThe originality of the thesis is in its investigation of these cases; and equally in making connections between them and the elements of art criticism and critical theory noted above.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miles, Malcolm Francis Richardson"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This book expands on a new cognitive theory which argues that what we see in autism is an extreme form of a tendency that exists in all people, and furthermore, that this tendency is stronger in males. Given the influence that males have had in shaping (western) society it begs the question - how has this greater tendency in males manifested in the social structures, norms and values that structure our society? This is the first book to explore how this inclination towards autism in the general population has shaped the society we live in. \"The Role of Autism in Shaping Society\" has three main areas of focus. In the first section, the author looks at the conditions that make up the autism spectrum in terms of characteristics, diagnosis and prevalence.In the second section, he discusses the problematic issue of how we should conceptualize the spectrum, and develops his new theory to provide a more comprehensive explanation of the condition. The final section explores the implications of this new theory on the social structures within which we live our daily lives. This accessible book combines perspectives from psychiatry, psychology, philosophy and sociology to provide one of the most encompassing and enlightening accounts of the autism spectrum to date. It will be of interest to researchers, psychologists, and anyone affected by the autism spectrum.

This paper addresses the issue of community participation in the context of the English planning system, which has recently been restructured to focus more sharply on integrating communities in the planning process. It presents findings of research into the workings of the reformed planning system, in particular in relation to the objective of public participation, using the case of the Planning Aid service. The paper sets the discussion in the context of two different forms of democracy (representative and deliberative democracy) and associated strategies for participation. It then outlines the recent reforms in the planning system, highlighting the different approaches to participation that are being applied. The paper then examines the case of Planning Aid, a service that aims to involve disadvantaged groups in the planning system. The paper concludes that the outcomes from recent experiences of participation in planning are in part due to the “hybrid” approaches that are emerging within the system. While this provides the potential for more inclusive planning, it is argued that this “hybridity” needs to be acknowledged by policy makers and practitioners if strategies and mechanisms are to be put in place that respond to the demands of different forms of democracy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carpenter, J","Brownill, S"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":30511,"sim:weight":0.378666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1928317,"sim:weight":0.292377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55310,"sim:weight":0.290471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98472,"sim:weight":0.282484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84410,"sim:weight":0.28071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108487,"sim:weight":0.276983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.256391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98731,"sim:weight":0.254153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84436,"sim:weight":0.237249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5629,"sim:weight":0.229954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.21782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.191296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.186788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The rhetorical strategies of these texts are explored in detail, to demonstrate the means by which an activity, of death preparation, and a concept, of \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027godly\u0027 dying, are invented and made compelling to readers.\nAn introductory chapter discusses the problems of classifying works in the Art of Dying genre, and the limitations of a strictly historical mode of analysis. Reasons are given for the decision to use rhetorical theory as a central analytical framework.\nThe first chapter examines an exemplary deathbed narrative. Stubbes\u0027 portrayal of his dying wife in A Christal Glasse (1591) helps to establish a Protestant discipline of \u0027godly\u0027 dying, which combines elements of exemplary martyrdom with an older tradition of diabolic deathbed drama. The mirror image of Stubbes\u0027 title indicates that godly Art of Dying literature is intended to be used for self-reflection and imitation.\nIn the central three chapters, the Art of Dying is considered as a godly regimen, created and conducted through printed manuals. Godly divines William Perkins, Nicholas Byfield and Samuel Crooke use various rhetorical methods to incite, regulate and suppress readers\u0027 emotions regarding the prospect of death.\nA final chapter returns to the use of personal examples in death preparation literature. Ward\u0027s Faith in Death (1622) collates the dying words of martyrs from Foxe\u0027s Acts and Monuments to invite readers\u0027 active contemplation of their own deaths. With \u0027lively\u0027 rhetoric, this text narrows the gap between celebrated and ordinary believers. It presents godly dying as an energetic, vocal, demonstrative act of testimony.\nIn conclusion, the thesis finds that godly Art of Dying literature directs the way readers imagine death and so prompts active, emotional and behavioural responses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mayhew, J"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Bevir and Collingwood support the notion of influence and argue that it does accommodate the agency of thinkers. The arguments of Condren and Skinner point to significant issues and problems in the practice of the history of ideas but it is argued that these points do not count decisively against employing the notion of influence. The defence of influence by Collingwood and Bevir is seen to need qualification in the light of post-structuralist arguments that challenge the monopoly of meaning that is claimed for authors of texts in the history of ideas. The article concludes by urging that the category of influence is compatible with a nuanced account of agency.","bibo:AuthorList":["Browning, G"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108414,"sim:weight":0.323476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443334,"sim:weight":0.306613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99341,"sim:weight":0.24831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.218689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99396,"sim:weight":0.199972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85275,"sim:weight":0.169294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25067,"sim:weight":0.162002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Seven teachers of health care professionals, working in a variety of higher education institutions around the UK, were interviewed using a semi-structured interview technique.\nThe interview schedules were analysed using Radnor’s framework for interpretive analysis (Radnor, 2002), in order to identify commonalities and differences both in relation to the teachers’ intentions and in relation to the different teaching activities they described. A range of perspectives were identified amongst the teachers, who were found to have a variety of personal motivations for incorporating global perspectives into their teaching. They described a wide variety of strategies for doing so, both in terms of the content of their teaching and in terms of the teaching processes they used. The results of the study illustrate the complexities both of defining ‘global perspectives’ in relation to higher education, and of identifying the underlying motivations that teachers and institutions may have for incorporating global perspectives into higher professional education.\nAs a result of analysing the interviews, a simple framework was devised to assist individual teachers when reflecting on how they might incorporate global perspectives into their teaching. It is believed that this framework could assist teachers to explore and reflect on their teaching practices—both the content of their teaching and the processes through which they facilitate student learning. The framework may also be of value to those at programme, institutional and wider levels who wish to explore how global perspectives can be incorporated into teaching within higher education.\nThe findings of the study suggest that there is a lack of clarity in relation to terminology used in relation to this topic area. The author proposes that to ensure progress in research and practice, a clearer set of terminology should be agreed upon to allow teachers to discuss their intentions and experiences using a shared language that is clearly understood by all.\nAlthough the study focused specifically on the experiences of teachers of health care professionals, it is believed that the findings of this study are relevant to teachers of other subject areas in higher education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Woolliams, M"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We argue in this article that a single-minded focus on explicit articulation, whilst currently the dominant logic of higher education, will inevitably fall short of providing students and staff with meaningful knowledge of standards and criteria. Inherent difficulties in the explicit verbal description of standards and criteria make a compelling argument for the consideration of the role of structured processes that support the effective transfer of both explicit and tacit assessment knowledge. With reference to both empirical evidence and the literature, we propose a conceptual framework for the transfer of knowledge of assessment criteria and standards that encompasses a spectrum of tacit and explicit processes, which has proven to be effective in practice in improving student performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Donovan, B","Price, M","Rust, C"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27452,"sim:weight":0.310916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57679,"sim:weight":0.270696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67989,"sim:weight":0.25705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.248653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821113,"sim:weight":0.23936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.235472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.222868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.212878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51515,"sim:weight":0.209109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":451648,"sim:weight":0.20624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.202453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108848,"sim:weight":0.199556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.19911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.197768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.196656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27527,"sim:weight":0.188902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One way of improving bond durability is through the use of surface treatments prior to bonding, which will activate the adherends’ surface, making it more receptive to the adhesive. In this study, the effects of two surface pre-treatments (corona discharge and flame ionization) on three timbers (maritime pine, iroko, and European oak) were evaluated quantitatively through contact angle measurements. These measurements allowed the determination of the changes in the timber surface thermodynamic characteristics, thus indicating which pre-treatment performed better. The results showed that both techniques increased each timber\u0027s surface free energy, which could translate into a durability enhancement of bonded joints. Overall, the corona-discharge treatment looks more promising, since this treatment leads to a bigger increase in the timber\u0027s surface energy, especially in its polar component, whilst also tended to be less species specific, less susceptible to variation, and the treatment effects lasted longer for this type of treatment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Custódio, J","Broughton, J","Cruz, H","Winfield, P"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5843946,"sim:weight":0.403262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.227263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.22352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.211329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26504,"sim:weight":0.20845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.190493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.190493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.188556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59935,"sim:weight":0.180735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.166632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26461,"sim:weight":0.161981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98963,"sim:weight":0.152544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821123,"sim:weight":0.151973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56580,"sim:weight":0.130624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Given a lack of touch-typing instruction in UK schools it was hypothesized that children\u0027s written compositions produced via the keyboard would be worse than produced by hand.\nAims.\nTo extend the work of Christensen (2004) and Rogers and Case-Smith (2002) by examining the relationship between handwriting fluency and keyboarding fluency throughout the primary school and studying the link between word-processed compositional quality and keyboarding fluency.\nSamples and methods.\nThe handwriting fluency and keyboarding fluency of 300 children in primary school were measured. Year S and year 6 children completed a measure of compositional quality by hand and by keyboard.\nResults and comment.\nThere was a high correlation between handwriting and keyboarding speed and handwriting speed was consistently faster than keyboarding speed across all ages. Only a small minority of children in years 5 and 6 had faster keyboarding than handwriting speed. Results showed that children\u0027s compositional quality was superior in the handwritten scripts as opposed to the keyboarded scripts. Keyboarded scripts were up to 2 years behind handwritten scripts in development. Writing by keyboard does not necessarily lead to improvements in script quality, compared with handwritten scripts. Explicit keyboarding instruction (touch-typing) is needed to develop keyboarding fluency and unlock the full potential of the word processor for children\u0027s writing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Connelly, V","Gee, D","Walsh, E"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316127,"sim:weight":0.148781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55108,"sim:weight":0.132071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85851,"sim:weight":0.127456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.126686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85336,"sim:weight":0.117808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.117398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109102,"sim:weight":0.117269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.112851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.108485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933572,"sim:weight":0.108485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.104785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108621,"sim:weight":0.101395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57289,"sim:weight":0.0916207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.0915273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.0738404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108924,"sim:weight":0.0731748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, while the centrality of the design jury as a site for learning disciplinary skills, beliefs, and values is now widely acknowledged, there continues to be considerable disagreement about what is learnt and how. While critical pedagogues argue that the design jury is a critic-centered ritual that coerces students into conforming to hegemonic notions of professional identity, the more commonly held conception is that the jury is a student-centered event that supports students in the construction of their own architectural identities. This article, inspired by Michel Foucault\u0027s studies of relationship between power and the formation of the modern self, reports on the findings of a year-long ethnographic study carried out in one British school of architecture. The research sought to unravel the complexities of the design jury as a site of dichotomous power relations, and the findings bring into question the efficacy of the design jury as a ritual that supports useful learning. The article concludes by proposing that the design jury be replaced by a new set of pedagogic events that are carefully constructed to support student learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Webster, H"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.241932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.238339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85165,"sim:weight":0.235112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.233683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.229636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1559155,"sim:weight":0.210027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.208057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.203051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.201482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.176795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This result can be directly used for the problem of class based image segmentation which has seen increasing recent interest within computer vision. Here the aim is to assign a label to each pixel of a given image from a set of possible object classes. Typically these methods use random fields to model local interactions between pixels or super-pixels. One of the cues that helps recognition is global object co-occurrence statistics, a measure of which classes (such as chair or motorbike) are likely to occur in the same image together. There have been several approaches proposed to exploit this property, but all of them suffer from different limitations and typically carry a high computational cost, preventing their application on large images.

The journals, and the pedagogical processes surrounding the use of the journals, were found to embrace many of the principles of critical and feminist pedagogy and to provide a valuable vehicle for the development of reflective professional practice. However, a focus on issues reflecting a wider context of social justice, for example, sexism and racism, was mostly only salient in the journals of the lecturers whose courses overtly involved these issues. These findings highlight a tension between respecting the rights of learners to construct their own knowledge and pursue areas of personal interest, and demanding attention to issues of equity and the role of education in social change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clifford, V"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These foundations include the Vaisnava goal of Self-realization, and the scriptural three steps of Lord Vishnu and His Vamana avatar. Vaisnava ethics such as humility, non-harming, non-possession, simple living, and devotional service helped inspire the Gandhian political economy of permanence called sarvodaya, which still influences thinking in the environment and peace movements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haigh, M"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85812,"sim:weight":0.170468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385397,"sim:weight":0.170041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.151553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.145983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85183,"sim:weight":0.145149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108479,"sim:weight":0.141394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108987,"sim:weight":0.130454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The transformational programme is best described as having three enablers namely teaching and learning materials to support practitioners, network meetings and a professional training programme for nominated subject learning coaches. The main focus here is on the latter of the three enablers, although issues of material design and network facilitation well impact on the research outcomes and thus cannot be completely ignored. The aim of the Subject Learning Coaches\u0027 Professional Training Programme provides training in coaching alongside the opportunity for accreditation for those wanting to complete a number of set assignments. Drawing on evidence from a number of sources, namely questionnaire data, interviews, and content analysis of the work produced by participants, the research uses an adaptation of the Logic Model (Kellogg, 2004) to evaluate impact. The research was carried out at an early stage of programme delivery so measurements of impact need to be viewed in this light. The article explains the context for change, focuses on the theoretical debate underpinning subject coaching, and identifies some initial findings in relation to programme impact worthy of sharing with the research community. Initial evidence indicates that where there is individual and organisational commitment then the impact is perceived to be considerable. This impact not only relates to changes observed in staff it relates to impact which has permeated beyond those engaged in the professional development programme to reach learners, other staff in the organisation and in some cases whole institutions. The use of Peer Coaching as a model for change is proposed as one of the key drivers to inspire and motivate lecturers in this sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Browne, E"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A major finding from this larger study was that the participating women located their cancer experience\nand their identity as a ‘patient’ in the context of other life experiences and identities. In that larger study, three major themes were identified: the meaning of the breast as a signifier of femininity post-diagnosis; the issue of control, in particular a lack and loss of control associated with the subjectivity of being a ‘patient’; and a theme around motherhood and the ‘good mother’ discourse. Considering that eight of the women in this study were mothers it is not surprising that they located their cancer experience within a context of their identity of being a ‘mother’. And yet, within biomedicine a woman’s other life experiences are often neglected and she is largely constructed as ‘patient’. This omission might have serious consequences for women’s treatment experience. For example, demands posed by her role as a ‘mother’, such as doing child care, and her role as a ‘patient’, i.e. attending several appointments a week, may clash, putting\nher under considerable stress.

They must deal with the diversity of implementation techniques and to meet a wide range of test requirements. However, they are in lack of software artefacts, the means of control over test executions and observation on the internal behaviour of the other services. An automated testing technique must be developed with capability of testing on-the-fly non-intrusively and non-disruptively. Addressing these problems, this paper proposes a framework of collaborative testing in which test tasks are completed through the collaboration of various test services registered, discovered and invoked at runtime using the ontology of software testing STOWS. The composition of test services are realized by using test brokers, which are also test services but specialized in the coordination of other test services.

The effect of the adhesive modulus was investigated by considering four different adhesives ranging in modulus from 6MPa to 3 GPa. To assess the influence of the apertures, some tests were carried out on box beams containing a single aperture on one side. Spot-welded plenum chambers and beams were also tested to provide a comparison of adhesive performance against conventional methods of joining. The effect of the adhesive modulus and the apertures in the plenum chambers on the results are discussed in the light of the results obtained, as well as the suitability of using adhesive bonding to reduce the vehicle weight.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fellows, N A","Harris, A","Durodola, J","Beevers, A"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.330941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.279037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.186687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24484,"sim:weight":0.176854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99168,"sim:weight":0.165273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99047,"sim:weight":0.148229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18164,"sim:weight":0.140912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24926,"sim:weight":0.136403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99089,"sim:weight":0.133647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24911,"sim:weight":0.131544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271236,"sim:weight":0.130573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99320,"sim:weight":0.129853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98934,"sim:weight":0.126573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931561,"sim:weight":0.123953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98541,"sim:weight":0.123212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25819,"sim:weight":0.0991582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98581,"sim:weight":0.0982325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25054,"sim:weight":0.0811013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There has also been a shift in the sites and agents of research education, and a related diversification of those sites and agents in the production of knowledge, including work-based knowledge. However, the introduction of these new forms of doctorate is not just a consequence of universities meeting increased demand, as, if this were so, the long established PhD would suffice. It also reflects internal and external pressures on providers to modify the doctoral experience, such as a desire by governments to tie more closely together doctoral study and professional practice. The implications of reforms to doctoral study are profound, insofar as they potentially threaten current hegemonic knowledge structures in UK universities. They also have implications for work-based learning, as these professional doctorates, practitioner-based doctorates and work-based doctorates, now described as ‘third generation’ doctorates, are having a significant impact on learning structures and working practices within the workplace. Indeed, they are designed to do just this; with the result that professional and work-based knowledge is being reconstructed within the academy, the profession and the workplace.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scott, D","Morrison, M"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, due to its central importance in many applications, several approximation algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present an analysis of three such algorithms based on convex relaxations: (i) LP-S: the linear programming (LP) relaxation proposed by Schlesinger (1976) for a special case and independently in Chekuri et al. (2001), Koster et al. (1998), and Wainwright et al. (2005) for the general case; (ii) QP-RL: the quadratic programming (QP) relaxation of Ravikumar and Lafferty (2006); and (iii) SOCP-MS: the second order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation first proposed by Muramatsu and Suzuki (2003) for two label problems and later extended by Kumar et al. (2006) for a general label set.\nWe show that the SOCP-MS and the QP-RL relaxations are equivalent. Furthermore, we prove that despite the flexibility in the form of the constraints/objective function offered by QP and SOCP, the LP-S relaxation strictly dominates (i.e., provides a better approximation than) QP-RL and SOCP-MS. We generalize these results by defining a large class of SOCP (and equivalent QP) relaxations which is dominated by the LP-S relaxation. Based on these results we propose some novel SOCP relaxations which define constraints using random variables that form cycles or cliques in the graphical model representation of the random field. Using some examples we show that the new SOCP relaxations strictly dominate the previous approaches.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pawan Kumar, M","Kolmogorov, V","Torr, P"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":21061,"sim:weight":0.65997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20514,"sim:weight":0.52676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21577,"sim:weight":0.366615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19540,"sim:weight":0.348165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":240478,"sim:weight":0.33351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19619,"sim:weight":0.2842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20513,"sim:weight":0.282582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931154,"sim:weight":0.273517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20310,"sim:weight":0.25501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19982,"sim:weight":0.241039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20044,"sim:weight":0.218863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19892,"sim:weight":0.213713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18487,"sim:weight":0.210137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19935,"sim:weight":0.206526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18561,"sim:weight":0.203552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18519,"sim:weight":0.195859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18497,"sim:weight":0.193283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20284,"sim:weight":0.185088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826755,"sim:weight":0.177971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20245,"sim:weight":0.177929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recently, complete (genome-scale) metabolic network models have been established for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and flux distributions have been predicted using constraints-based modeling and optimization algorithms such as linear programming. While these models are useful for investigating possible flux states under different metabolic scenarios, it is not clear how close the predicted flux distributions are to those occurring in vivo. To address this, fluxes were predicted for heterotrophic Arabidopsis cells and compared with fluxes estimated in parallel by 13C-metabolic flux analysis (MFA). Reactions of the central carbon metabolic network (glycolysis, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle) were independently analyzed by the two approaches. Net fluxes in glycolysis and the TCA cycle were predicted accurately from the genome-scale model, whereas the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway was poorly predicted. MFA showed that increased temperature and hyperosmotic stress, which altered cell growth, also affected the intracellular flux distribution. Under both conditions, the genome-scale model was able to predict both the direction and magnitude of the changes in flux: namely, increased TCA cycle and decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase flux at high temperature and a general decrease in fluxes under hyperosmotic stress. MFA also revealed a 3-fold reduction in carbon-use efficiency at the higher temperature. It is concluded that constraints-based genome-scale modeling can be used to predict flux changes in central carbon metabolism under stress conditions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, T","Poolman, M","Howden, A","Schwarzlander, M","Fell, D","Ratcliffe, R","Sweetlove, L"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85140,"sim:weight":0.323666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109084,"sim:weight":0.298855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68722,"sim:weight":0.216898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269883,"sim:weight":0.157262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332856,"sim:weight":0.140589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933695,"sim:weight":0.137346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63741,"sim:weight":0.114623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.105029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Drawing on research into one teaching programme using technology to reach students across the globe two key questions are asked. The first relates to the potential for creating communities of discourse when participating in on-line interaction. The second considers the nature of the information revealed in providing insight to the learning experiences of those engaging in on-line programmes of study. Practical issues associated with the ethics of disclosure and ownership of cyber information are considered. Finally the value of this information for the oral historian is assessed as is the potential of ethnography as a research tool for life history.","bibo:AuthorList":["Browne, E"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.310071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.297317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.292318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.275396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98881,"sim:weight":0.226761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Some students, confronted with complex research processes, might adopt practices that compromise standards that are unacceptable within a research community. These practices challenge the PhD student–supervisor relationship and have implication for the individual, the supervisory team, the institution, the awarding body and the wider research context. Discussion relating to misconduct within the PhD is of international importance if the aim is to encourage and facilitate rigorous research practice. Cases involving academic and research misconduct, especially those occurring at PhD level, are likely to become more frequent as numbers of PhD students increase and will demand appropriate, defensible responses from supervisors. Misconduct during PhD study can be difficult to resolve because of lack of clarity in definitions, supervisor naı¨veté and failure to acknowledge students’ decision making limitations. Using scenarios from the first author’s supervisory practice to illustrate issues of concern for students and supervisors during PhD supervision, the authors aim to illuminate the importance of engagement with regulatory bodies; problems of knowledge and understanding transfer; culturally specific issues and meanings of academic theft.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mitchell, T","Carroll, J"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.308329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55554,"sim:weight":0.295809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9631121,"sim:weight":0.277101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.275331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1559155,"sim:weight":0.275261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55530,"sim:weight":0.268168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98600,"sim:weight":0.255338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.235325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.217797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108848,"sim:weight":0.214949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23253,"sim:weight":0.20732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100444,"sim:weight":0.175526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56635,"sim:weight":0.162149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98717,"sim:weight":0.153431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the process, they help environmental awareness to trickle into areas of life where it would not ordinarily impinge. In this case study of a community-based land reclamation research project, supported jointly by the NGO Earthwatch and Oxford Brookes University, analysis of the motivations and experiences of project volunteers shows that their aims include making a personal contribution to enhancing the quality of the environment and networking with like-minded individuals, and that they expect to carry their new understanding back into their everyday lives to influence other people in their workplace.

Led by the leading Catholic cleric, Archbishop Paul Cullen, critics of the Irish poor law sought to lessen reliance on the institution of the workhouse and to expand outdoor relief thus bringing the system closer to its English model. The poor law authorities supported by the Irish landed elite fought successfully to maintain the limited and restrictive nature of the system fearful of the consequences of extending\nlocal discretion.

The idea for the Decade emerges from a progression of high-level international conferences, beginning with Stockholm, 1972, that have seen ESD thinking move from general statements of intent to increasingly detailed specifications for action. There has also been a growth in awareness that the changes to the curriculum for sustainable development must suffuse all areas of education provision.

The main findings of this paper report the evident thirst students voiced for more reliable marking processes and clearer guidelines on assessment requirements and criteria. However, whilst students applauded the criterion reference grid as a \u0027good idea\u0027 and one that did help clarify assessment requirements they also highlighted several shortcomings. Such shortcomings included issues of subjectivity and multiple interpretations of criteria and standards. The paper concludes that the criterion-reference grid, from the student perspective, appeared to be of limited practical benefit unless presented as part of multifaceted approach including explanation, exemplars and opportunities for discussion.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Donovan, B","Price, M","Rust, C"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27452,"sim:weight":0.354769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930635,"sim:weight":0.33387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57679,"sim:weight":0.33294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.260724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821127,"sim:weight":0.250453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108108,"sim:weight":0.247478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.223343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.21161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.200553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57352,"sim:weight":0.182678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.174786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Each author provides both a case study of what \u0027masculinity\u0027 means (or fails to mean) in a specific historical moment, and contributes to a wider collective analysis of the changing historical dynamics to male identity.

Little is known about how universities in general are implementing personal development plans, nor how engaged students will become in compiling a set of records of their learning and progress, which they themselves make and keep. The aim of this article was to discover how higher education institutions were approaching PDP, to gather primary and secondary data on the implementation of PDP across the sector, and to identify good practice. Telephone interviews were carried out with a snowball sample of academics from a range of English universities, both pre and post 1992 institutions. The findings fell into two categories: those relating to process and those relating to the more complex conceptual elements of PDP implementation. The process findings indicated that a wide variety of approaches is being taken, that there is heavy reliance on computer-based tools and that support for staff and the nurturing of internal champions was a significant part of successful implementation. Good practice within the conceptual aspects of PDP would include a clear vision of where responsibility lies for PDP within a university, a shared understanding of the purpose of PDP and the promotion of a culture which engages both students and staff. Overall, the research showed that implementing personal development planning is a continuing learning process for universities in England.","bibo:AuthorList":["Quinton, S","Smallbone, T"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Quinton and T Smallbone.

The process of design in itself is an unknown phenomenon for first year students of architecture, so they look to studio tutors to help them in unravelling the components by which to ‘design’. The question therefore, is how does the tutor do this in a way which will encourage a student’s own design philosophy, and not invoke their own? Also is there any place for a third party, in the form of older students, in making this process more productive? The Peer Assisted Learning (PAL) programme has allowed for a study of all of these points to be investigated by assessing the role and procedure of the tutorial, what makes for a good ‘facilitator of learning’ and whether PAL has any place within architectural education specifically. Observing students over\none semester it was apparent that a more open critical ability developed in discussion with peers and mentors, free from the strain of impressing tutors with knowledge.

This has dramatically increased the number of international students attending Western universities and the delivery of courses overseas. Despite rhetoric concerning internationalisation of the curriculum changes mainly focus on inducting international students into the Western educational system and little attention has been paid to developing curricula to meet the future needs of all students as global citizens. The views of students themselves on their futures and the education they require to live those futures has rarely been sought.\nThis paper introduces the voices of students from all campuses of a large Australian university with eight campuses, two of them ‘offshore’. Interviews with students investigated their perceptions of their futures and their experience of internationalisation of curriculum at the university. Despite their diverse backgrounds and locations the students held similar visions of their futures and saw the need for their education to be relevant to those futures. However, what this meant in practice was complex and informed by identity and geographic location. While some students accepted uncritically what the university offered others experienced their education as a colonialist enterprise. This study highlights the need for universities to know their students and to involve them in curricular planning and in building a new critical pedagogy responsive to the rich diversity of needs of our current student cohorts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clifford, V"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Whether a result of a growing climate of increasing accountability or an expansion in the size and diversity of student populations (Oldfield and Baron, 1998), both quality assurance and quality enhancement are now considered essential components of any quality management programme (Brookes and Downie, 2002). Despite the abundance of research on the subject, there is no universal consensus on how best to measure quality in higher education. In the UK, quality assessment procedures are both internally and externally driven using different mechanisms and quality criteria. As such the assessed \u0027quality\u0027 of any given programme of study may therefore be variable across different audits. In addition, the potential value of the different assessments for quality enhancement purposes may also vary. Given the importance of quality assurance on the higher education agenda, this paper undertakes a critical evaluation of the different methods used to assess the quality of provision in the UK through a case study of one department. A comparison of internally versus externally driven quality audits is undertaken at three different levels; module, programme, and subject level. By examining the methods and criteria used to assess the quality of provision and the way in which the quality assessment findings are disseminated, the paper considers the potential value of these different audits in enhancing the quality of higher education provision and identifies action which could be taken by institutions and departments as a result. The authors adopt a secondary approach, drawing on relevant quality management literature, the quality audits conducted within one department as well as those by the Subject Centre for Hospitality, Leisure, Sport, and Tourism of the Higher Education Academy, and the most recent Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) audits within the relevant area, i.e in Unit 25 of their classification of subjects. The findings suggest that while externally driven quality audits enable comparative benchmarking between individual programmes, they may not be the most appropriate for enhancing the quality of higher education provision. The potential for quality enhancement is determined by the manner in which the evaluation is conducted and subsequent change implemented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Becket, N","Brookes, M"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":451617,"sim:weight":0.460923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":451618,"sim:weight":0.450631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.321343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539967,"sim:weight":0.244987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using an ethnographic approach, this thesis investigates the educational experiences of army children. Four year eight children from one school were observed and interviewed in order to build up in-depth case studies. In addition, the outcomes from discussions with their parents, teachers and other associated education and army professionals were explored. The emerging findings were subsequently compared with findings from a second research site. Working within a sociocultural theoretical framework, it was found that there was a clash of cultures between the world of the army and the world of the school. As a result, army children\u0027s needs were not sufficiently identified and understood and neither the army nor schools attended to the children\u0027s needs. Furthermore, the culture of the home was seen to have a strong effect on the educational experiences of the army child with the role of the mother being considered to be particularly important. Another important finding was that the mobile lifestyle also had a negative effect on the children\u0027s educational experiences. As a result, the children developed unique and individual coping strategies. The research has implications for both military and educational policy makers, as well as for the teachers and parents of army children, in terms of collaboration between army and local education authorities in order to improve the educational experiences of the army child. More generally, the research addresses the role of the home in supporting school experiences and suggests that further research into the effect of mobility on children\u0027s\neducational achievement is necessary.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clifton, G"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.368617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.363962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82298,"sim:weight":0.34405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.328528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.323837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.313574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.312847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.311889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82850,"sim:weight":0.303904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99933,"sim:weight":0.286192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83229,"sim:weight":0.267763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.261291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98688,"sim:weight":0.256656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.235613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98717,"sim:weight":0.215519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98927,"sim:weight":0.204254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A common form of feedback that is used widely in e-learning is the use of model answers. However, model answers are deficient in many respects. In particular, the notion of a \u0027model\u0027 answer implies the existence of a single correct answer applicable across multiple contexts with no scope for permissible variation. This reductive assumption is rarely the case with complex problems that are supposed to test students\u0027 higher-order learning. Nevertheless, the challenge remains of how to support students as they assess their own performance using model answers and other forms of non-verificational \u0027feedback\u0027. To explore this challenge, the research investigated a management development e-learning application and investigated the effectiveness of model answers that followed problem-based questions. The research was exploratory, using semi-structured interviews with 29 adult learners employed in a global organisation. Given interviewees\u0027 generally negative perceptions of the model-answers, they were asked to describe their ideal form of self-assessment materials, and to evaluate nine alternative designs. The results suggest that, as support for higher-order learning, self-assessment materials that merely present an idealised model answer are inadequate. As alternatives, learners preferred materials that helped them understand what behaviours to avoid (and not just \u0027do\u0027), how to think through the problem (i.e. critical thinking skills), and the key issues that provide a framework for thinking. These findings have broader relevance within higher education, particularly in postgraduate programmes for business students where the importance of prior business experience is emphasised and the profile of students is similar to that of the participants in this research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cox, B","Handley, K"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.409729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60331,"sim:weight":0.379886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.375332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.375261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.369551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821117,"sim:weight":0.355078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821113,"sim:weight":0.350447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.333102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270217,"sim:weight":0.313053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.279413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.270831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Schön subsequently presented architectural education as a paradigm for all professional education (1987). Schön identified a number of key elements in architectural education that together constituted his theories of \u0027reflective learning\u0027 and the \u0027reflective practitioner\u0027. Central to Schön\u0027s understanding of learning to design were two concepts. Firstly, the necessity for students to engage in studio-based projects that simulated the complexities of real life projects. Secondly, the importance of reflection in the design process that was constituted of: reflection-in-action, reflection-on-action and most critically reflection-on-action that allowed students to observe and re-align their thinking with the \u0027expert\u0027 thinking of their tutors. Arguably, Schön\u0027s notions of reflective learning have framed most of the discussions about architectural education to date. This paper will argue, somewhat paradoxically, that Schön was a remarkably unreflective thinker.

Study of the American-European relationship in recent years has been moved forward by the notion of Atlantic history and the study of the Atlantic world. The present volume makes a fresh contribution by refocusing attention on the question of the interdependence of Europe and America.\nOld World, New World addresses topics that are timely, given contemporary public events, but that are also of interest to early modern and modern historians. By turning attention from the Atlantic World in general to the relationship between America and Europe, as well as using Thomas Jefferson as a lens to examine this relationship, this book carves out its own niche in the history of the Atlantic world in the age of revolution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pearsall, S"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Issues for these women relate to feeling different as a result of cancer, fear of recurrence, feeling ‘out of sync’ and altered embodied subjectivity. Young women with breast cancer use three processes to integrate the changes that cancer brings, namely, balancing, normalising and changing. Our conceptual model also highlights young women’s needs, primarily for support, information, childcare, counselling and spiritual support. Areas of reproduction, fertility and sexuality were also of particular concern. The included papers have methodological limitations that impact on our findings, such as opportunistic data analyses,\nlack of theoretical frameworks and limited reference to socio-cultural factors.\nConclusion:\nThe conceptual model developed as a result of this meta-ethnography provides a basis for practitioners to address these young women’s concerns more adequately and comprehensively.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, E","McCann, L","Armes,  J","Richardson, A","Stark, D","Watson, E","Hubbard, G"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23875,"sim:weight":0.63225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.358701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98701,"sim:weight":0.283339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.265426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25947,"sim:weight":0.262579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.239765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.207314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56557,"sim:weight":0.193604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.189067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.186921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.182457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104038,"sim:weight":0.171428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104012,"sim:weight":0.166525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56993,"sim:weight":0.152061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.151713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99137,"sim:weight":0.126169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Multiple parity predictions to correct single errors based on the Hamming principles are used. The expressions for the parity prediction are derived from the input operands, and are based on the primitive polynomials of the fields. This technique, when compared with existing ones, gives better performance. It is shown that single error correction (SEC) multipliers over GF(2m) require slightly over 100% extra hardware, whereas with the traditional SEC techniques, this figure is more than 200%. Since single bit internal faults can cause multiple faults in the outputs, this has also been addressed here by using multiple Hamming codes with optimised hardware.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mathew, J","Jabir, A","Rahaman, H","Pradhan, D"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8932594,"sim:weight":0.291651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22848,"sim:weight":0.220729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25904,"sim:weight":0.176272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932504,"sim:weight":0.170543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997959,"sim:weight":0.16912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930535,"sim:weight":0.167174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71018,"sim:weight":0.161866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26422,"sim:weight":0.156264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997781,"sim:weight":0.154981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930627,"sim:weight":0.151169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23989,"sim:weight":0.147931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934025,"sim:weight":0.142471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933439,"sim:weight":0.133465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934810,"sim:weight":0.129986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930659,"sim:weight":0.123675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98721,"sim:weight":0.12002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The tool kit found at Jebel Faya has affinities to the late Middle Stone Age in northeast Africa, indicating that technological innovation was not necessary to facilitate migration into Arabia.

Its starting points are to restore and elevate social and moral purpose in leadership as first-order constructs that have theoretical and practical implications for existing and potential leader educators. This is not necessarily an easy thing to do. Asking educators and researchers of education leadership to define what they consider to be the core moral values underpinning leadership in educational settings usually results in some fairly bland, if fundamentally important statements about putting learners at the heart of leadership praxis, especially that which occurs in educational settings. In practice, numerous organisational mission statements attest to this rhetorical conviction. Yet, it is current policy contexts that place relations between leaders, teachers, and learners in contradictory ‘moral’ positions. Drives to improve student performance through increased competition in the market-place, intensified procedures for monitoring and evaluation, and frenetic commitments to ‘change’ as overarching leadership mantras have relegated Sergiovanni’s (1998) definition of pedagogical leadership ‘that invests in capacity building by developing social and academic capital for students and intellectual capital for teachers’ as second, even third order constructs.\nThis book intends to reverse the process and in doing so, it will relegate to second order, and by lively debate and illustrative vignettes, many, though not all of the hegemonic constructs that are prevalent in current ‘managerial’ times. This book will therefore define and challenge a paradox; as governments express commitment to an educational settlement that minimises exclusion, widens participation, and promotes ‘active’ citizenship, the much heralded vanguards of that settlement - leaders and managers - are being enjoined to reduce their thinking and action to technicist ‘manoeuvres’ (Grace, 2000:236) in which aspirations towards social justice can become more distant, strangely exotic even in their expression. As importantly, such technical manoeuvring is not accompanied by a reduction in leadership and management tasks and responsibilities. As more is demanded of organizations and their leaders in terms of responsibilities for learning in areas of health, sexuality, drug awareness, physical exercise and nutrition, citizenship, work experience, race equality, and skills in familial and social caring, questions arise about the extent to which ‘social justice’ constitutes a wide umbrella under which such interests might ‘shelter’ or whether social justice is to be considered ‘separately’ with attendant dangers to be seen as add-on and therefore potentially marginalized or distinct from the total enterprise that constitutes education and learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morrison, M"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.333092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.332804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.314635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.312449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.280699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper examines how nurses are prepared to be clinically competent and safe at registration, so that they are fit for practice and purpose. It follows up two papers on competence published in 1997 and 1998 and investigates subsequent developments.\nBackground. In 1979, major changes in nursing affected nurse education and preparation for competence. In the following two decades, it became clear that nurses lacked clinical skills. This paper examines subsequent changes and asks the question whether this crucial shortcoming has now been remedied. This paper considers the background and context of change in nursing and nurse education in the 1980s. It looks at the new ideology, to prepare the ‘knowledgeable doer’ and examines the\nconsequences of the change on nursing competency from the 1990s to the present day.\nMethods. This is a position paper. Professional policy documents from the English National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting, United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting and Nursing and Midwifery Council, government reports and legislation on nursing and relevant nursing literature are examined and critically analysed and conclusions drawn.\nConclusions. From 1923–1977, mandatory nursing syllabuses set by the General Nursing Council of England and Wales required the registered nurse to have acquired certain specific clinical skills. These were rigorously tested to an explicit standard set by the General Nursing Council before a nurse was awarded state registration. Twenty-five years later, the loss of this system for ensuring this competence and the\nimplications of this loss, have been widely recognised. As a result, many nurse training institutions have introduced clinical skills laboratories, simulation of practice and the Objective Structured Clinical Examination. However, to the authors’ surprise and contrary to their initial expectations, the Nursing and Midwifery Council has not made these systems uniform or mandatory and so still has no way of ensuring all nurse training is producing safe nurses in the United Kingdom.

UK investment decision-making is distinguished by the primacy attributed to portfolio benchmarking as an influence on investment strategy. The wider logic underpinning property benchmarking is subjected to critical appraisal.

The appraisal model relies upon the valuer/developer having an understanding of the future in terms of the future marketability of the completed development and the future cost of development. In some cases the developer has some degree of control over the possible variation in the variables. However, other variables are totally dependent upon the vagaries of the market at the completion date. To try to address the risk of a different outcome to the one expected the developer will often carry out a sensitivity analysis on the development. This paper aims to look at the processes for so doing and the role of the decision maker in the analysis.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach – Traditional sensitivity analysis has generally only looked at the best and worst scenarios and has focused on the anticipated or expected outcomes. This does not take into account uncertainty and the range of outcomes that can happen. A fuller analysis should include examination of the uncertainties in each of the components of the appraisal and account for the appropriate distributions of the variables. This requires a standardised approach and the use of a generic forecasting software package.\n\nFindings – There are numerous risks involved in the development of real estate. By allowing the decision maker to contribute to the assessment of these risks, the analysis provides the decision maker with a greater understanding of the critical variables and their impact upon the viability of the final scheme.\n\nOriginality/value – This analysis shows that developers can get a better understanding of the upside and downside risks associated with their project.","bibo:AuthorList":["Atherton, E","French, N","Gabrielli, L"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Atherton, N French and L Gabrielli.

Two key drivers are bringing change in the public sector: New Public Management; and the introduction of accruals accounting. New Public Management involves the empowerment of front-line staff to determine how public services\nare to be delivered. It gives them greater power over how budgets are to be spent, including over real estate assets. The central government authorities determine what services are to be produced and set and enforce standards. Top-down controls are reduced with incentives\nfor front-line staff to achieve performance targets. Power over real estate assets tends to shift to the service providers. Accruals accounting involves matching revenue against the costs of earning it so that surpluses or deficits can be calculated. Traditionally, the public sector has used cash accounting systems, which have resulted in them not paying the true economic cost of the assets they occupy. These changes raise questions about what assets ought to be owned, which disposed of, and whether renting is a better alternative for the public sector. They bring about changes in asset management practices. As a result, the\nmanagement of public lands has tended to become more closely aligned to management systems in the private sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Grover, R"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The results of dynamic analyses were that the speed of impact has less effect on the behaviour of the structure than the magnitude of the impacting force. The paper demonstrates that a non-linear pushover analysis is capable of predicting collapse. The results of a parametric study indicated that ultimate loads were largely independent of bay depths and only slightly dependent on bay width. The paper shows that under service design loads a cost-effective way of reducing the occurrence of collapse is by the insertion of cross-braced plan bracing inserted at the lowest loaded level. To ensure optimum results the pinned joints in the diagonal cross-bracing members and the column base-plate to ground connection must be able to absorb 1.5 mm plastic deformation along the direction of the member. It is also recommended that bolts in the column base-plate to ground connections should be placed in symmetric patterns about the column centroidal axis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ng, A L Y","Beale, R G","Godley, M H R"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99212,"sim:weight":0.235069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269982,"sim:weight":0.224282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99089,"sim:weight":0.197375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.186987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929844,"sim:weight":0.176463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108701,"sim:weight":0.155175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930220,"sim:weight":0.154154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.145803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26309,"sim:weight":0.131966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One consequence, radiation-induced genomic instability (RIGI), is a hallmark of tumorigenesis and is often assessed by measuring delayed chromosomal aberrations. We utilised a technique that facilitates transient immobilization of primary lymphocytes for targeted microbeam irradiation and have reported that environmentally relevant doses, e.g. a single 3He2+ particle traversal to a single cell, are sufficient to induce RIGI. Herein we sought to determine differences in radiation response in lymphocytes isolated from five healthy male donors. Primary lymphocytes were irradiated with a single particle per cell nucleus. We found evidence for inter-individual variation in radiation response (RIGI, measured as delayed chromosome aberrations). Although this was not highly significant, it was possibly masked by high levels of intra-individual variation. While there are many studies showing a link between genetic predisposition and RIGI, there are few studies linking genetic background with bystander effects in normal human lymphocytes. In an attempt to investigate inter-individual variation in the induction of bystander effects, primary lymphocytes were irradiated with a single particle under conditions where fractions of the population were traversed. We showed a marked genotype-dependent bystander response in one donor after exposure to 15% of the population. The findings may also be regarded as a radiation-induced genotype-dependent bystander effect triggering an instability phenotype.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kadhim, M A","Lee, R","Moore, S R","Macdonald, D A","Chapman, K L","Patel, G","Prise, K M"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":64141,"sim:weight":0.131891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.10032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.0825557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23818,"sim:weight":0.0669234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269993,"sim:weight":0.0620414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper shows that the Weibull distribution predicts correctly the probability of failure locally initiated by flaws if and only if the probability that a flaw will be critical is a power law or can be approximated by a power law of the applied stress.\nContrary to the common belief, on the basis of a theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations we show that in general, for non-interacting flaws randomly located in a stressed volume, the distribution of the minimum failure stress is not necessarily a Weibull distribution. For the simple cases of a single group of identical flaws or two flaw size groups each of which contains identical flaws, for example, the Weibull distribution fails to predict correctly the probability of failure. Furthermore, if in a particular load range, no new critical flaws are created by increasing the applied stress, the Weibull distribution also fails to predict correctly the probability of failure of the component. In all these cases however, the probability of failure is correctly predicted by the suggested alternative equation. This equation is the correct mathematical formulation of the weakest-link concept related to random flaws in a stressed volume. The equation does not require any assumption concerning the physical nature of the flaws and the physical mechanism of failure and can be applied in cases of locally initiated failure by non-interacting entities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Todinov, M"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109094,"sim:weight":0.234704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176886,"sim:weight":0.214717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.209244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.187566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933882,"sim:weight":0.160593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26443,"sim:weight":0.155155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929386,"sim:weight":0.153685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933163,"sim:weight":0.147748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934278,"sim:weight":0.147521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.140872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.138663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931825,"sim:weight":0.117038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931258,"sim:weight":0.105288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.0744694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Compulsory purchase legislation and laws on ownership were used to expropriate private property. After 1990 the newly elected democratic governments changed the constitutions to permit and protect private ownership of land. However, compulsory purchase is essential in a market economy to deal with certain aspects of market failure. These include the need to facilitate the provision of collective goods, such as infrastructure and utility networks, and regeneration where the state may need to disrupt a prisoners’ dilemma situation. In spite of their commitment to the inviolability of private property, the transitional economies have had to develop compulsory purchase procedures and means of assessing compensation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Grover, R"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The paper is based on research commissioned by the Investment Property Forum (IPF) and funded through the IPF Research Programme (2006-2009).\nDesign/methodology/approach – Interviews were undertaken with experts from the fields of property investment and building engineering. The interviews were undertaken with to identify: the current knowledge of EPCs in the property investment sector; key issues with practical implementation of the legislation; and perceptions of the potential impacts of legislation, particularly in relation to value stakeholder and behaviour.\nFindings – The paper finds that, although the regulations have been published, there is still a need for clarification in the marketplace with regard to some of the detail of regulations and the certification process. The following areas are of most concern to property investors: costs of surveys; potential difficulties with the process; and a shortage of assessors. With respect to these impacts it is becoming clear that investors who have not yet started considering the EPBD and its requirements within their strategy are likely to face difficulties in the short term. The most significant value-related impacts of EPBD are expected to be value differentiation of properties and “price chipping” against the rental or capital value of the property, where an occupier or potential purchaser will use the recommendations contained within an EPC to force a reduction in value. The latter is expected to emerge in the short term, whereas the former is expected to be realised over the medium to long term. Both these impacts have potentially significant implications for property investment holdings and also future investment behaviour.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dixon, T","Keeping, M","Roberts, C"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90061,"sim:weight":0.424445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.284963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.279492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.265115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91147,"sim:weight":0.24985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.220466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.204565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.192422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107788,"sim:weight":0.189701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12702,"sim:weight":0.180462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.165271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The result is waste and poorer level of productivity than are capable of being achieved if best practice were to be used. The paper focusses on two key drivers of change in the public sector namely the so-called New Public Management and the introduction of accruals accounting into the public sector. The New Public Management is a term used to describe a range of changes that involve the empowerment of front-line staff to determine how public services are to be delivered. The policies give them much greater power over how budgets are to be spent, including over real estate assets. Central government performs the role of determining what services are to be produced and of setting and enforcing standards for these. Top-down controls over expenditure, staffing, and assets are reduced with incentives for front-line staff\nto achieve performance targets but penalties if they fail to do so. Power over real estate assets tends to shift to the service providers, such as teachers and doctors. This opens up questions as to whether the most effective provision of real estate assets is by ownership or rental, as\nwell as the generation of performance targets for real estate. Accruals accounting is the system of accounting used by the private sector. It matches revenue against the costs of earning it so that profits or losses can be calculated. Traditionally the public sector has not used such a system but has used cash accounting ones. These have resulted in public bodies not paying the true economic cost of the assets they occupy. They have not had to provide for the depreciation, amortisation or impairment of real estate assets or to ensure that their use achieves a target rate of return on the capital employed. When these are required of public\nbodies, it raises questions about what assets ought to be owned and whether renting is an option. It brings about changes in management, such as the use of investment appraisal techniques to determine expenditure and explicit risk management methods. The combination\nof obliging public bodies to meet the full economic costs of the assets used and giving greater powers to front-line staff with incentives to achieve performance targets changes approaches to the management of public lands. The management of public lands tends to become more\nclosely aligned to management systems in the private sector and under-performing assets are identified and disposed of.","bibo:AuthorList":["Grover, R"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Our method is based on higher order conditional random fields and uses potentials defined on sets of pixels (image segments) generated using unsupervised segmentation algorithms. These potentials enforce label consistency in image regions and can be seen as a generalization\nof the commonly used pairwise contrast sensitive smoothness potentials. The higher order potential functions used in our framework take the form of the Robust Pn model and are more general than the Pn Potts model proposed recently in [3]. We prove that the optimal swap and expansion moves for energy functions composed of these potentials can be computed by solving a st-mincut problem. This enables the use of powerful graph cut based move making algorithms for performing inference in the framework. We test our method on the problem of multi-class object segmentation by augmenting the conventional CRF used for object segmentation with higher order potentials defined on image regions. Experiments on challenging data sets show that integration of higher order potentials quantitatively and qualitatively improves results leading to much better definition of object boundaries. We believe that\nthis method can be used to yield similar improvements for many other labelling problems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kohli, P","Ladicky, L","Torr, P H"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":20025,"sim:weight":0.511817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20024,"sim:weight":0.506904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":241183,"sim:weight":0.427279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18529,"sim:weight":0.420594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18547,"sim:weight":0.408851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20023,"sim:weight":0.375164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19669,"sim:weight":0.371053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18494,"sim:weight":0.369673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18487,"sim:weight":0.365916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":241269,"sim:weight":0.358304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18565,"sim:weight":0.350214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20513,"sim:weight":0.347352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":241169,"sim:weight":0.325438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21468,"sim:weight":0.324767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19619,"sim:weight":0.320795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":241247,"sim:weight":0.320502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147606,"sim:weight":0.310034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20572,"sim:weight":0.30992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21588,"sim:weight":0.306449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18561,"sim:weight":0.293659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The focus of this work was at the level of the academic school using a range of change practices including the appointment of school-based learning technologists and e-learning champions, supporting schools to write their own strategies, a pedagogical framework of engaging with e-learning, and curriculum development and evaluation of school-supported projects. It is clear that the implementation of the e‐learning strategy has led to a large and increasing proportion of our students experiencing blended learning. In addition, there are initial indications that this has enhanced some learning and teaching processes. Where there has been sustainable embedding of effective e-learning, the following levers were identified as particularly important: flexibility in practices that allow schools to contextualise their plans for change, the facilitation of communities of key staff and creating opportunities for staff to voice and challenge their beliefs about e-learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sharpe, R","Benfield, G","Francis, R"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Sharpe, G Benfield and R Francis.

However, recent developments in behavioural finance challenge this, and thus question the validity of the assumptions on which expected utility theory are based. However, existing studies on this matter have mainly focused on capital markets, and research in the property industry has tended to lag behind. Therefore, adopting UK property professionals as samples, this paper aims to explore the reliability of the invariance assumption of people\u0027s behaviour under expected utility theory.\nDesign/methodology/approach – To fulfil the aim of this paper, a questionnaire survey was undertaken among the property professionals in London during the second half of 2005. Benefited from the group administrative method 78 out of 99 questionnaires were returned, and this reflects an overall response rate of approximately 79 per cent.\nFindings – The research identifies that among the tested UK samples, property professionals change their preferences according to the way the questions are presented. In other words, the invariance assumption is not valid among UK property professionals. This paper then further investigates the possible factors that might influence people\u0027s decisions. It suggests that people would change their choices anyway, regardless of their gender, age, degree subjects or their working experience in the property industry. Therefore, further research is needed to find some other factors that might influence this particular behaviour among UK property professionals.\nOriginality/value – This paper draws the industry attention to the use of existing investment models, and suggests that an understanding of people\u0027s behaviour could help to improve decision making.","bibo:AuthorList":["Xu, Y","Dent, P"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.248739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316147,"sim:weight":0.220793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585490,"sim:weight":0.218501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98968,"sim:weight":0.205822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.184547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.177781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.176039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59026,"sim:weight":0.165546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.160835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.160404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.156287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85709,"sim:weight":0.139344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Large-bodied primates were once favored prey by Tikunas, but are now rarely hunted owing to the diminishing primate populations. We evaluate the effect of a hunting ban on woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagothricha) by the residents of Mocagua, using qualitative and quantitative methods.\nHunting records showed that from February 2005 to February 2009, a total of 25,142 kg of mammal bushmeat were harvested in Mocagua and San Martın. Primates constituted 345 kg of the total harvest. From 223 kg of large-bodied primates extracted for subsistence purposes, 160 kg were hunted in San Martı´n and 64 kg in Mocagua. Large-bodied primates made up 70% of the total primate biomass in Mocagua (398 kg/km2) and 22% in San Martın (199 kg/km2). From dietary records, we found bushmeat constituted 30% of protein consumption in Mocagua and 37% in San Martın. Primates were absent in records from Mocagua, and appeared only three times in those from San Martı´n suggesting\ninconsistencies with hunting data. Despite its moderate consumption, bushmeat was identified as a highly valued food source during focus group activities. Primate pet-keeping and part utilization were observed in San Martın but not in Mocagua, possibly as a consequence of fewer primates being hunted. We suggest that Mocagua provides an example of how community-based conservation strategies can be achieved, where opportunities for employment in tourism and alternative food sources are available.","bibo:AuthorList":["Parathian, H","Maldonado, A"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108766,"sim:weight":0.218867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15174,"sim:weight":0.183249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.146956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.14581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.14581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86207,"sim:weight":0.142215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108120,"sim:weight":0.133229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.132757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.132757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316052,"sim:weight":0.128919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.11793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.117336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108177,"sim:weight":0.115367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108959,"sim:weight":0.107595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58802,"sim:weight":0.107198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.094796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Then, using data from a large cohort enrolled on a first-year business studies programme in a UK university, a comparative analysis of the academic performance of home and international students reveals considerable differences, with the marks of the latter being substantially lower than those of the former. In order to establish whether a particular assessment method is culturally biased compared to others, following ordinary least squares estimation of regressions on each assessment method for the home and international student subsamples of the cohort, a Chow test is employed. The main finding indicates that assessment by examination penalises international students beyond differences in ability levels, as measured by multiple-choice test and coursework assignment scores. On the basis of this evidence, it is suggested that, in culturally mixed classes, the exclusive adoption of the end-of-course examination be avoided.","bibo:AuthorList":["DeVita, G"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, in a previous paper, Xu and Dent, identify that property professionals in both the UK and China do not behave in a rational manner as assumed by traditional finance models. This is because the sample in the study is risk seeking when the probabilities of receiving capital gains are low. This current paper aims to explore whether university training would influence the respondents’ risk preferences. A survey of undergraduate and postgraduate real estate students at Oxford Brookes University was used to investigate the potential of university training to improve people\u0027s decision making, so as to enhance the rationality of their behaviour.\nDesign/methodology/approach – A survey of undergraduate and postgraduate real estate students at Oxford Brookes University was conducted during the academic year 2007/2008 to investigate the potential of university training to improve people\u0027s decision making, so as to enhance the rationality of their behaviour. In total, there were 206 students participated in the survey (156 undergraduates and 52 postgraduates).\nFindings – This paper finds that preferences of Oxford Brookes University students seem likely to change once the same question is phrased differently. This preference is more relevant to the university training they received than their gender. After three years’ study at universities, students seem more likely to make rational decisions, i.e. similar to normative theory suggestions regarding the actions of rational people.\nOriginality/value – This paper is only a start of behavioural research of people\u0027s decision making, and further studies could also cover areas such as property experts\u0027 decision-making process or validity of other assumptions of expected utility theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Xu, Y","Dent, P"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":55554,"sim:weight":0.353909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653106,"sim:weight":0.271475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1559155,"sim:weight":0.260011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98929,"sim:weight":0.254553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.25447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.244994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98968,"sim:weight":0.230407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85602,"sim:weight":0.222268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.215964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.2033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27310,"sim:weight":0.179115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.154156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of the major causes for this lies in the home students\u0027 belief that assessed multicultural group work has a detrimental effect on their individual average mark. Using data from a large cohort enrolled on a first-year business studies programme of a UK university, this study employs regression analysis to empirically investigate the extent to which this belief is supported by the data. The results suggest that the performance of culturally mixed groups is neither a function of the individual ability of the least able group member, nor of the average ability of the members of the group. Instead, in this context, the group work mark is more likely to reflect the ability of the most able group member. The data also indicate that assessed multicultural group work has, on average, a positive rather than negative effect on the individual average mark of all students, evidence consistent with the synergistic effects expected to emerge in multicultural groups.","bibo:AuthorList":["DeVita, G"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It was found that students prefer to study at home, many using their own laptops to get online. Once online, students most frequently engaged in activities related to accessing and reading online learning materials. Students used a wide variety of communication tools to contact friends and peers but a narrower range to contact tutors, with a preference for e-mail.

Discussing methods or outcomes, as well as works produced by peers, involves idiosyncratic theorising based on an eclectic set of case studies and habitually eschews established academic theory. In this paper, I trace some historical and institutional factors that influence the controversial relationship between film theory and industry practice (Elliot 2000, Bell 2004, Hanney 2005)in UK Higher Education, involving action research to incorporate a student perspective. A questionnaire reveals general student preference for industry led learning outcomes drawn from publications by UK media industry sector skills council Skillset. These were ranked higher than outcomes quoted from the Quality Assurance Agency’s relevant academic subject benchmarks. Yet subsequent focus group discussions reveal that some more advanced students value theory to facilitate particular aims. In order to deal with diverging institutional guidance and support students more effectively, I argue that applying David Kolb\u0027s Experiential Learning Cycle to curricular planning supports a reconciliation of scholarly and entrepreneurial ambition. I propose to further develop a structured approach termed ‘Method of Reflective Film Analysis’ as a means to harness existing theory to clearly articulated individual research and production aims, and as a foundation for curriculum design, teaching and learning strategies as well as further research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schönfeld, C"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.33606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.312009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9631121,"sim:weight":0.302456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.300284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.286438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.269911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.253156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.237546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A planar endomorphism typically folds the phase space along curves J0 where the Jacobian of the map is singular. The critical locus,denoted J1, is the image of J0. It is often only piecewise smooth due to the presence of isolated cusp points that are persistent under perturbation. We investigate what\nhappens when the stable set Ws of a fixed point or periodic orbit interacts with J1 near such a cusp point C1. Our approach is in the spirit of bifurcation theory, and we classify the different unfoldings of the codimension-two singularity where the curve Ws is tangent to J1 exactly at C1. The analysis uses a local normal-form setup that identifies the possible local phase portraits. These local phase portraits give rise to\ndifferent global manifestations of the behaviour as organised by five different global bifurcation diagrams.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hobbs, C A","Osinga, H M"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":71553,"sim:weight":0.305973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26329,"sim:weight":0.283219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85311,"sim:weight":0.282677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24576,"sim:weight":0.23813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30755,"sim:weight":0.228639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26062,"sim:weight":0.221058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":381693,"sim:weight":0.220993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332856,"sim:weight":0.175729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268818,"sim:weight":0.152649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

More specifically, the Centre is helping to promote Brookes’ commitment to the development of research-based teaching and learning. In November 2006 an online survey of first-year undergraduate students was conducted with the primary objective of establishing the expectations of students with respect to a research-based curriculum. A total of 548 students replied to the questionnaire and display broadly the same personal and study characteristics as all 4,191 first-year undergraduates at Brookes.

Whilst no causal link was established between the presence of the wind farm and house price, there was some evidence to suggest that both noise and flicker from the turbine blades could blight certain property and that the view of countryside enjoyed by the occupier had some value which may be affected by a wind farm.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sims, S","Dent, P","Oskrochi, R"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15364,"sim:weight":0.468187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108820,"sim:weight":0.345811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176817,"sim:weight":0.340452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84355,"sim:weight":0.329078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":357178,"sim:weight":0.257226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85514,"sim:weight":0.203448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108778,"sim:weight":0.189297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.181553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98616,"sim:weight":0.174992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386779,"sim:weight":0.174063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.172948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2745396,"sim:weight":0.167614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.164532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.162909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108833,"sim:weight":0.15943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.158452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.149313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62636,"sim:weight":0.146404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109002,"sim:weight":0.136226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99903,"sim:weight":0.132389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Currently two approaches prevail in the racking industry to determine the shear stiffness of these frames. The Rack Manufacturers’ Institute (RMI) code uses a theoretical formula whereas the Federation Europeenne de la Manutention (FEM) code requires testing. There is a considerable difference in the stiffness values determined by the two approaches. A literature review showed that the stiffness predicted by the RMI code could be up to 20 times higher than the experimental stiffness. The shear stiffness of the frames is influenced by the bracing pattern and the connections between the elements. Local distortion of the thin walled open section upright, joint eccentricity and slip due to bolt clearances all affect the behaviour of the frames. The present paper describes experimental and numerical studies conducted at Oxford Brookes University to evaluate shear stiffness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sajja, S","Beale, R","Godley, M"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269982,"sim:weight":0.299887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99212,"sim:weight":0.21292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.21209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98745,"sim:weight":0.191267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.187312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930220,"sim:weight":0.157715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99263,"sim:weight":0.152608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99168,"sim:weight":0.152337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98541,"sim:weight":0.146641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98638,"sim:weight":0.145037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929844,"sim:weight":0.13687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99089,"sim:weight":0.136031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.129759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.0897206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Peat-swamp forest has recently been recognized as an important habitat for the Southern Bornean gibbon (Hylobates albibarbis), but information is scarce on the factors that link gibbon density to characteristics of this unique ecosystem. Our aims in this study were firstly to estimate gibbon density in different forest subtypes in a newly protected, secondary peat-swamp forest in the Sabangau Catchment, Indonesia, and secondly to identify which vegetation characteristics correlate with gibbon density. Data collection was conducted in a 37.1 km2 area, using auditory sampling methods and vegetation speed plotting. Gibbon densities varied between survey sites from 1.39 to 3.92 groups/km2. Canopy cover, tree height, density of large trees and food availability were significantly correlated with gibbon density, identifying the preservation of tall trees and good canopy cover as a conservation priority for the gibbon population in the Sabangau forest. This survey indicates that selective logging, which specifically targets large trees and disrupts canopy cover, is likely to have adverse effects on gibbon populations in peat-swamp forests, and calls for greater protection of these little studied ecosystems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hamard, M","Cheyne, S","Nijman, V"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":70813,"sim:weight":0.253066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62150,"sim:weight":0.250655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61296,"sim:weight":0.229924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60630,"sim:weight":0.229448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.207925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60227,"sim:weight":0.206085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108412,"sim:weight":0.191674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.184635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59935,"sim:weight":0.181896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.15456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.154559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62968,"sim:weight":0.148132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386270,"sim:weight":0.14522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62279,"sim:weight":0.144348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63716,"sim:weight":0.1411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.133435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61457,"sim:weight":0.131011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.120428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108092,"sim:weight":0.120106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61873,"sim:weight":0.108424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its population decline is inferred mainly due to vast habitat loss. Few recent data are available regarding its distribution or abundance. The aim of our study was to assess the conservation status of T. v. nestor throughout its known historical range by establishing presence/absence and correlating\nthese data with semi-structured interviews determining human perceptions and threats. Twenty-six sites were investigated, with presence of T. v. nestor being confirmed at 11 and indicated\nthrough questionnaires only at 2 additional sites. The present distribution of T. v. nestor is severely fragmented both locally and regionally. More than half of the populations comprised 1 or 2 groupsonly and, being isolated in a matrix of urban landscapes, are close to unviable. Conflicts between local people and T. v. nestor were identified at such sites, where reports of troops crop-raiding gardensand plantations were associated with negative perceptions. Consequences for crop-raiding langurs\nranged from shouting to (infrequently) shooting and killing by dogs. Negative views towards T.v. nestor were significantly related to the length of time they spent in anthropogenic landscapes, while more positive views were significantly associated with the length of time T. v. nestor spent in\nforested areas. Evidence of local extinctions means that the remaining, yet increasingly fragmented habitat of the highly arboreal T. v. nestor is critical for survival. Intervention to manage this human–wildlife conflict is vital. An integrated approach using international and local conservation\nauthorities is highly recommended.","bibo:AuthorList":["Parker, L","Nijman, V","Nekaris, K"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.173716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.170168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.170168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.169229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62510,"sim:weight":0.165223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.15814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86207,"sim:weight":0.155133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.154629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.154629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382177,"sim:weight":0.150425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.14805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58019,"sim:weight":0.138668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99092,"sim:weight":0.131456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15174,"sim:weight":0.118253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382175,"sim:weight":0.11793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.109445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108766,"sim:weight":0.104048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25053,"sim:weight":0.0877363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In Asia the unsustainable trade in wildlife has been identified as one of the main conservation challenges. Internationally, wildlife trade is regulated through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (CITES) to which all Southeast Asian nations are signatory. I obtained data on international trade in CITES-listed animals in the period 1998–2007. In all \u003e35 million animals (0.3 million butterflies; 16.0 million seahorses; 0.1 million other fish; 17.4 million reptiles; 0.4 million mammals; 1.0 million birds) were exported in this period, 30 million (~300 species) of them being wild-caught. In addition 18 million pieces and 2 million kg of live corals were exported. Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and China are the major exporters of wild-caught animals and the European Union and Japan are the most significant importers. Over this period exports in birds significantly decreased, trade in the other taxa either increased or remained stable. For all taxa but butterflies the vast majority of individuals represent wild-caught individuals. Records of illegal or undeclared international trade are scant but can be significantly larger than levels of official exports. It is concluded that there is an urgent need for better assessments of what levels of exploitation are sustainable (including exploring appropriate proxies for Non Detriment Findings), for initiatives to make regulatory mechanisms more effective (including the introduction of minimum mandatory standards and monitoring selected wildlife trade hubs), and for better licensing and registration. Funding for at least some of these initiatives can be obtained by imposing small levies on exports of CITES-listed wildlife.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nijman, V"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90542,"sim:weight":0.29736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.229884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60055,"sim:weight":0.221492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.214177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382177,"sim:weight":0.20516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385438,"sim:weight":0.187073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.185306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58019,"sim:weight":0.182326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.176197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.176197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.171921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.171921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494504,"sim:weight":0.163124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382175,"sim:weight":0.160834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99092,"sim:weight":0.159649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15174,"sim:weight":0.157446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.145478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513386,"sim:weight":0.135847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14726,"sim:weight":0.125367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The cryptic nature of these nocturnal primates has led to a lack of understanding of their distribution patterns and abundance. In short surveys, often few if any lorises are detected, meaning that the few available density estimates are from long-term studies. Based on new research in Sebangau National Park, Borneo, and compilation of survey data from other areas, we provide the first comparative abundance estimates for all five slow loris species: N. coucang occurred in significantly higher abundances (median encounter rate 0.80/km: n \u003d 15), than N. bengalensis (0.26/km; n \u003d 12), or N. javanicus (0.11/km: n \u003d 2), N. menagensis (0.02/km: n \u003d 3), and N. pygmaeus (0.13/km: n \u003d 4). Abundance estimates in Sebangau (0.19/km) did not increase with increasing survey effort, but for all species and studies combined, study duration was positively correlated with abundance estimates. We did not find a relation between abundance and body mass, nor between abundance and latitude. Long-term studies are more likely to be conducted at sites where the species of interest is particularly plentiful. The data suggest that slow lorises occur at low abundances throughout much of their range, and some in larger social groups than previously assumed. We recommend taking into account the species’ heterogeneous distribution (potentially requiring larger survey effort), their social structure, the use of red lights as opposed to white lights whilst surveying, and to make use of their vocalisations when surveying slow lorises.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nekaris, K","Blackman, G","Nijman, V"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99304,"sim:weight":0.29334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86207,"sim:weight":0.25245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.225358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108770,"sim:weight":0.222049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62510,"sim:weight":0.215089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.208953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.208952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61468,"sim:weight":0.201171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31144,"sim:weight":0.198042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108618,"sim:weight":0.186198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.171071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269921,"sim:weight":0.163124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15174,"sim:weight":0.126171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25053,"sim:weight":0.119693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62129,"sim:weight":0.112011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108088,"sim:weight":0.0838808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This opportunity is, however, being largely shunned thanks to the prominence of a marketisation discourse that has claimed the internationalisation agenda as its own, redefining it narrowly in commercially expedient terms. Adopting a broadly Foucauldian perspective on discourse, this article offers a critique of HE internationalisation in the UK. It begins with an analysis of the global trade in HE courses on international markets, arguing that it is inappropriate to treat curricula as though they were merely commodities reducible solely to exchange value. Having questioned the marketisation discourse, the article proceeds to expose the inadequacies of a piecemeal \u0027infusion approach\u0027 to curriculum internationalisation. Simply flavouring curricula with \u0027international\u0027 or \u0027global\u0027 elements fails to address more fundamental issues of the educational process posed by multicultural recruitment and teaching. The critique is founded on a questioning of the cross-cultural validity of purchaser/provider models in general and the student-as-customer metaphor in particular. A \u0027learning as eating\u0027 conception of education finds its apogee in Ritzer\u0027s McDonaldised university, with its programmatic reduction of HE, casualisation of teaching labour and \u0027product\u0027 standardisation. The article ends with a polemical call for a reclamation of the internationalisation agenda on the part of practitioners who are interested in creating culturally inclusive, fair and genuinely educational forms of multicultural HE teaching and assessment.","bibo:AuthorList":["DeVita, G","Case, P"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":16141,"sim:weight":0.430659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75202,"sim:weight":0.430659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16185,"sim:weight":0.41629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9430117,"sim:weight":0.38582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16182,"sim:weight":0.38582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43873,"sim:weight":0.294802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4900293,"sim:weight":0.28406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51515,"sim:weight":0.26465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99108,"sim:weight":0.250761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653284,"sim:weight":0.25006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.248227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.243338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.240917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154826,"sim:weight":0.240917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.240364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.239557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155856,"sim:weight":0.239123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2837,"sim:weight":0.23886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108468,"sim:weight":0.233995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.231764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here, we examine in tobacco leaves the structural relationship between Golgi and ER membranes using electron microscopy and demonstrate that Golgi membranes contain elements that are in close association and/or in direct contact with the ER. We further visualized protein trafficking between the ER and the Golgi using Golgi marker proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein. Using photobleaching techniques, we showed that Golgi membrane markers constitutively cycle to and from the Golgi in an energy-dependent and N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive manner. We found that membrane protein transport toward the Golgi occurs independently of the cytoskeleton\nand does not require the Golgi to be motile along the surface of the ER. Brefeldin A treatment blocked forward traffickingof Golgi proteins before their redistribution into the ER. Our results indicate that in plant cells, the Golgi apparatus is a dynamic membrane system whose components continuously traffic via membrane trafficking pathways regulated by brefeldin A– and N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive machinery.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brandizzi, F","Snapp, E L","Roberts, A G","Lippincott-Schwartz, J","Hawes, C R"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24400,"sim:weight":0.321377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65549,"sim:weight":0.15531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85386,"sim:weight":0.130509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98959,"sim:weight":0.117025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99284,"sim:weight":0.105224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although it is difficult to estimate the number of homeless people who are misusing drugs or the number of drug users who are homeless, UK and international literature indicate a significant overlap between the two groups. Homeless drug users (HDUs) tend to experience many life problems and their situation has been described as a double jeopardy [Neale, J. (2001). Homelessness amongst drug users: A double jeopardy explored. The International Journal of Drug Policy, 12, 353-369]. Compounding this, emerging data now show that HDUs are at increased risk of being infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The concept of social exclusion is critically reviewed as a means of understanding the experiences and needs of HDUs infected with HCV and, in light of this, policy and practice are discussed. It is argued that efforts to tackle broader social problems are indirectly assisting this vulnerable group, but more joined-up strategies and targeted measures are still required. These include tackling negative community and professional attitudes and discriminatory practices; more integrated service provision and professional training; and drawing HDUs with HCV into policy and practice debates as advisors, educators and collaborators. To conclude, suggestions for future research that would help to clarify some of the complexity surrounding the behaviours, experiences and service needs of HDUs with HCV are made.","bibo:AuthorList":["Neale, J"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":10479,"sim:weight":0.334857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269586,"sim:weight":0.304724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107315,"sim:weight":0.281569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.270044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22750,"sim:weight":0.260209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.237748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.237506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.237366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.22053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108065,"sim:weight":0.209185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.17154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper seeks to fill some of these knowledge gaps. Between January and May 2006, 75 current injectors were recruited and interviewed through three needle exchange programmes located in diverse geographical areas of West Yorkshire. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Framework. Findings showed that injectors were often positive about the help they received from generic health and social care services. Nonetheless, they identified a range of barriers relating to inability to access desired assistance, the burden of appointments, travel to services, stigma and negative staff attitudes, personal ill-health, lack of material resources, and anxieties about accessing support. Although some types of barriers were more evident at some services than at others and/or affected particular subgroups of injector more than others, the impact of any barrier was contingent on a range of factors. These included the attitudes of individual professionals, the circumstances and needs of individual injectors, the local availability of suitable alternative services, and the frequency with which a service needed to be accessed. In order to better understand and potentially reduce service barriers, findings are linked to broader conceptual and theoretical debates relating to social exclusion and Foucault\u0027s analyses of power and knowledge.","bibo:AuthorList":["Neale, J","Tompkins, C","Sheard, L"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.306698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.302002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998639,"sim:weight":0.284805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496274,"sim:weight":0.281322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.280271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109025,"sim:weight":0.261957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10062,"sim:weight":0.253169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.252267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.235119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.214698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107315,"sim:weight":0.211983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340178,"sim:weight":0.210784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.208206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56108,"sim:weight":0.207516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10479,"sim:weight":0.188199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Adult-centred frameworks for health maintenance and the promotion of well-being risk ignoring young people\u0027s conceptualizations and experiences of health and health-relevant behaviours. However, the current policy emphasis in the UK and elsewhere apparently seeks to position young people at the centre of their own health-related decisions. Building on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, this paper examines and critiques policies relating to young people in UK, European and worldwide contexts. This paper then introduces data from two qualitative studies conducted in the UK. These studies illustrate that young people\u0027s definitions of health often run counter to prevailing public health and health promotion discourses. Young people do, however, often exhibit strategies for managing their health, even though they are frequently restricted by the perceptions that adults have about their lives and behaviour. This paper argues that the new policy discourse is not yet being systematically turned into action to give all young people a voice. This is important to begin to understand young people\u0027s perspectives about what matters to them and what really influences their health behaviours.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wills, W J","Appleton, J V","Magnusson, J","Brooks, F"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The aim of the systematic review was to update previous research to determine whether screening for CRC using the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) reduces CRC mortality and to consider the benefits, harms, and potential consequences of screening.\nMETHODS: We searched eight electronic databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, AMED, SIGLE, and HMIC). We identified nine articles describing four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving over 320,000 participants with follow-up ranging from 8 to 18 yr. The primary analyses used intention to screen and a secondary analysis adjusted for nonattendance. We calculated the relative risks and risk differences for each trial, and then overall, using fixed and random effects models.\nRESULTS: Combined results from the four eligible RCTs indicated that screening had a 16% reduction in the relative risk (RR) of CRC mortality (RR 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78-0.90). There was a 15% RR reduction (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.92) in CRC mortality for studies that used biennial screening. When adjusted for screening attendance in the individual studies, there was a 25% RR reduction (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.84) for those attending at least one round of screening using the FOBT. There was no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.02) or all-cause mortality excluding CRC (RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: The present review includes seven new publications and unpublished data concerning CRC screening using FOBT. This review confirms previous research demonstrating that FOBT screening reduces the risk of CRC mortality. The results also indicate that there is no difference in all-cause mortality between the screened and nonscreened populations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hewitson, P","Glasziou, P","Watson, E","Towler, B","Irwig, L"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The review highlights the importance of transparent guideline development procedures and the need for robust primary research to inform future evidence-based models of follow-up care for men with prostate cancer.","bibo:AuthorList":["McIntosh, H M","Neal, R D","Rose, P","Watson, E","Wilkinson, C","Weller, D","Campbell, C"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5844569,"sim:weight":0.419002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88307,"sim:weight":0.291848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.215561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.213118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.20898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.197158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83172,"sim:weight":0.185492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.171059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.149312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.135555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These assessments are pivotal in uncovering need, safeguarding children and in determining levels of health intervention to be offered to children and their families by the health visiting service in the UK.\nObjectives\nThe central focus of this paper is to outline the critical attributes of the basic principles that underpin health visiting assessment practice that emerged as part of a case study enquiry.\nDesign\nA case study design informed by a constructivist methodology was used to examine health visitors’ professional judgements and use of formal guidelines in identifying health needs and prioritising families requiring extra health visiting support.\nSettings\nThe main study was conducted in three community Trust case sites in England, UK, with pilot work being undertaken in a fourth site.\nMethods and participants\nFifteen health visitors participated in the main study and data were collected during 56 observed home visits to families receiving extra health visiting support. Separate in-depth interviews were conducted with the health visitors, pre- and post-home contacts, while 53 client interviews also took place.\nResults/conclusions\nThe analysis suggests that there are certain fundamental elements associated with the majority of health visitor assessments and these have been termed assessment principles. These characteristics are integral to, and provide the basis upon which health visitors’ assessments are conducted and professional judgement is formed. They reflect the basic principles of health visiting assessment practice, which exist despite the constraints and realities of the practice context and can be differentiated from the activity centred methods of assessment processes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Appleton, J V","Cowley, S"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.324228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99137,"sim:weight":0.317681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654845,"sim:weight":0.272033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57679,"sim:weight":0.241103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98600,"sim:weight":0.237575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.233643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1541037,"sim:weight":0.214242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.208029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.205411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":294473,"sim:weight":0.200055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.175923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At follow-up, 33 months later, 14.4% of the sample had shared needles and/or syringes in the 3 months prior to interview; if the definition of equipment-sharing is extended to sharing filters, spoons or flush water, then 21.8% had shared in the same period. Logistic regression analyses were performed to establish the co-variables associated with equipment-sharing for those of the study population who were injectors at baseline and who had been interviewed at all four sweeps; separate additional analyses were performed for those receiving baseline treatment inside prison and for those receiving treatment outside prison. Variables occurring in the models independently associated with equipment-sharing included severity of drug dependence, poorer mental health and whether or not the interviewee\u0027s partner had a drug problem, with the last co-variable indicating the continuing importance of the social patterning of equipment sharing. Further, a very strong independent association was found between frequency of injecting and recent equipment-sharing: other things being equal, those injecting drugs most often are those who are most likely to share injecting equipment. This is not simply self-evidential; it also speaks to the importance of \u0027accidental\u0027 sharing. Theorising of this risk behaviour must not just emphasise the situated rationality of sharing, but must also embrace contingency.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bloor, M","Robertson, M","McKeganey, N","Neale, J"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91663,"sim:weight":0.312435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10479,"sim:weight":0.237476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109025,"sim:weight":0.235106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.205167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.174811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.169809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.165236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.163304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.159122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998639,"sim:weight":0.153368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83239,"sim:weight":0.146204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85332,"sim:weight":0.137057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.125459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67195,"sim:weight":0.100079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Little is understood about the impact of screening on the emotional well-being of women with a family history of breast cancer. This qualitative study explores the value that women at increased risk placed on screening, both pre- and post-cancer diagnosis and the impact of the diagnosis. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 12 women, aged 35-50, diagnosed with breast cancer while on an annual mammographic screening programme. Women described the strong sense of reassurance gained from screening prior to diagnosis. This faith in screening was reinforced by early detection of their cancer. Reactions to diagnosis ranged from devastation to relief at having finally developed a long-expected condition. Despite their positive attitudes about screening, not all women wanted to continue with surveillance. For some, prophylactic mastectomy was preferable, to reduce future cancer risk and to alleviate anxieties about the detection of another cancer at each subsequent screen. This study illustrates the positive yet diverse attitudes towards mammographic screening in this group of women with a family history of breast cancer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clements, A","Henderson, B","Tyndel, S","Evans, G","Brain, K","Austoker, J","Watson, E"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100417,"sim:weight":0.707558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10928,"sim:weight":0.604192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23820,"sim:weight":0.471554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98701,"sim:weight":0.453725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931032,"sim:weight":0.447883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99220,"sim:weight":0.439795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.394366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1594206,"sim:weight":0.336752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.303111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.275773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929976,"sim:weight":0.264199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85277,"sim:weight":0.246789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.218881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.146962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448025,"sim:weight":0.139772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These methods are motivated by the observations that the performance of minimization algorithms depends on: (a) the initialization used for the primal and dual variables; and (b) the number of primal variables involved in the energy function. Our first method (dynamic -expansion) works by ‘recycling’ results from previous problem instances.The second method simplifies the energy function by ‘reducing’ the number of unknown variables present in the problem. Further, we show that it can also be used to generate a good initialization for the dynamic -expansion algorithm by ‘reusing’ dual variables.\nWe test the performance of our methods on energy functions encountered in the problems of stereo matching, and colour and object based segmentation. Experimental results show that our methods achieve a substantial improvement in the performanceof -expansion, as well as other popular algorithms such as sequential tree-reweighted message passing, and max-product belief propagation.We also demonstrate the applicability of our schemes for certain higher order energy functions, such as the one described in [1], for interactive texture based image and video segmentation. In most cases we achieve a 10-15 times speed-up in the computationtime. Our modified -expansion algorithm provides similar performance to Fast-PD [2], but is conceptually much simpler. Both - expansion and Fast-PD can be made orders of magnitude faster when used in conjunction with the ‘reduce’ scheme proposed in this\npaper.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alahari, K","Kohli, P","Torr, P H"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19669,"sim:weight":0.59275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18499,"sim:weight":0.355427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":240478,"sim:weight":0.349906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20021,"sim:weight":0.33702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20023,"sim:weight":0.325264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20572,"sim:weight":0.308922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19927,"sim:weight":0.298537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20513,"sim:weight":0.297915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19535,"sim:weight":0.294682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21588,"sim:weight":0.294111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20024,"sim:weight":0.280208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18561,"sim:weight":0.279071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931813,"sim:weight":0.278499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21577,"sim:weight":0.276983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20025,"sim:weight":0.251489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934481,"sim:weight":0.24767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933744,"sim:weight":0.246045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84788,"sim:weight":0.238662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108372,"sim:weight":0.235642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.23288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In order to obtain a larger set of taxa (altogether 2719 species), we include also DNA sequences of two other mitochondrial genes: cytochrome b (cob) (4614 sequences, 2087 species) and 16S (708 sequences, 498 species). Our results confirm the existence of a wide gap between intra- and interspecies divergences for both cox1 and cob, and indicate that distance-based DNA barcoding provides sufficient information to identify and delineate bird species in 98% of all possible pairwise comparisons. This DNA barcoding gap was not statistically influenced by the number of individuals sequenced per species. However, most of the hybridising parapatric species pairs have average divergences intermediate between intraspecific and interspecific distances for both cox1 and cob.\nConclusions/Significance: DNA barcoding, if used as a tool for species discovery, would thus fail to identify hybridising parapatric species pairs. However, most of them can probably still assigned to known species by\ncharacter-based approaches, although development of complementary nuclear markers will be necessary to account for mitochondrial introgression in hybridising species.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aliabadian, M","Kaboli, M","Nijman, V","Vences, M"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":57876,"sim:weight":0.349236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.232319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32132,"sim:weight":0.214446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26936,"sim:weight":0.196708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99170,"sim:weight":0.188059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98876,"sim:weight":0.185104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62634,"sim:weight":0.180007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.168256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.157059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496524,"sim:weight":0.15672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393532,"sim:weight":0.148528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23530,"sim:weight":0.134689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60227,"sim:weight":0.1345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316331,"sim:weight":0.113389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108527,"sim:weight":0.10429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23870,"sim:weight":0.0936224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Future work should examine screening for treatment-specific sequelae and the quality of care for co-morbid disease.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khan, N","Ward, A","Watson, E","Austoker, J","Rose, P"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":88307,"sim:weight":0.571939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494383,"sim:weight":0.568759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23820,"sim:weight":0.316997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99220,"sim:weight":0.29525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.285564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931032,"sim:weight":0.270081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.211917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.186532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66882,"sim:weight":0.168439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91804,"sim:weight":0.164663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.160933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.149656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.14311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.14311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99012,"sim:weight":0.141883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.136431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.134731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.130208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The reduced order model is obtained by applying a projection of the coupled system matrices, from a higher dimensional to a lower dimensional subspace, whilst preserving essential properties of the coupled system. The basis vectors for projection are computed efficiently using the Arnoldi algorithm, which generates an orthogonal basis for the Krylov Subspace containing moments of the original system. The key idea of constructing a reduced order model via Krylov Subspaces is to remove the uncontrollable, unobservable and weakly controllable, observable parts without affecting the transfer function of the coupled system. Three computational test cases are analyzed, and the computational gains and the accuracy compared with the direct inversion method in ANSYS.\nIt is shown that the reduced order model decreases the simulation time by at least one order of magnitude, while maintaining the desired accuracy of the state variables under investigation. The method could prove as a valuable tool to analyze complex coupled structural–acoustic systems, and their subsequent optimization or sensitivity analysis, where, in addition to fast analysis, a fine frequency resolution is often required.","bibo:AuthorList":["Puri, R S","Morrey, D","Bell, A J","Durodola, J F","Rudnyi, E B","Korvink, J G"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.219287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26766,"sim:weight":0.21097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85525,"sim:weight":0.21057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.207947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28686,"sim:weight":0.199049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59004,"sim:weight":0.193131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26750,"sim:weight":0.192914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.189392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22852,"sim:weight":0.186718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795333,"sim:weight":0.185336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18157,"sim:weight":0.175833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99445,"sim:weight":0.165323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573416,"sim:weight":0.156075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98580,"sim:weight":0.140241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99129,"sim:weight":0.134333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An investigation using stated preference discrete choice experiments","bibo:abstract":"Objectives: To estimate the relative importance to patients of continuity of care compared with other aspects of a primary care consultation.\nMethods: We carried out a discrete choice experiment in Leicestershire and London on a strati¢ed random sample of 646 community dwelling adults taken from general practitioner (GP) registers, plus 20 interviews\nwith Punjabi, Urdu and Gujarati speakers.The attributes examinedwere: the type of professional consulted, relational continuity, informational continuity and access. Results: Individuals’ values changed according to their reason for making a primary care consultation. If consulting for minor familiar symptoms, individuals would be prepared to trade o¡ one extra day’s wait to see a GP rather than a nurse, 0.9 days for relational continuity, and1.6 days for informational continuity. If consulting for a newcondition they were uncertain about, they would be prepared to trade o¡ an additionalwait of 3.5 days to see a GP rather than a nurse, 2.4 days for relational continuity and 3.9 days for informational continuity. For a routine check-up, an individual would be prepared to trade o¡ an additional wait of 3.5 days to see a GP rather than a nurse, 4.2 days for relational continuity and 7.8 days for informational continuity.\nConclusions: Respondents stated their preference to wait longer to see a familar medical practitioner who was well informed about their casewhen they had a problem causing uncertainty or needed a routine checkup. They preferred quick access for likely minor ‘low impact’ symptoms. Appointment systems in general practice should be sufficiently flexible to meet these different preferences.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, D","Tarrant, C","Windridge, K","Bryan, S","Boulton, M","Freeman, G","Baker, R"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Methods: Semi-structured interviews (n \u003d 187) were conducted in two specialist community prescribing agencies and two residential rehabilitation agencies. Seventy-nine new treatment clients were interviewed, and 59 of these were re-interviewed three months later. Interviews were also conducted with 27 agency staff and 22 individuals who had referred the drug users into treatment. Findings: Difficulties in implementing user involvement in drug treatment decision making could be grouped under five broad headings: (1) the perceived characteristics, needs and expectations of drug users; (2) the attitudes of professionals; (3) the dynamics of treatment encounters; (4) treatment programme design; and (5) structural factors affecting service provision. Conclusions: While involving drug users in treatment decisions is achievable, the problems can be substantial and complex. More financial resources to increase the availability and accessibility of treatment options; improved communication between service providers and their clients; and an investment in education, training and skills development can all potentially promote client participation. Nonetheless, some constraints to full involvement in decision making are likely to be inevitable and even necessary.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fischer, J","Neale, J"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1926523,"sim:weight":0.27233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.272225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108284,"sim:weight":0.253067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.238098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10062,"sim:weight":0.222024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.218988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.187279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.173128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.15244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98998,"sim:weight":0.146014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.145588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.139222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For the goals of species identification in animals, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) has been introduced as standard marker. Making use of the difference in intra- and interspecific genetic variation – the DNA barcoding gap – cox1 can be used as a fast and accurate marker for the identification of animal species. For the Order Primates we compare the performance of cox1 (166 sequences; 50 nominal species) in species-identification with that of two other mitochondrial markers, 16S ribosomal RNA (412 sequences, 92 species) and cytochrome b (cob: 547 sequences, 72 species). A wide gap exist between intra- and interspecific divergences for both cox1 and cob genes whereas this gap is less apparent for 16S, indicating that rRNAgenes are less suitable for species delimitation in DNA barcoding. For those species where multiple sequences are available there are significant differences in the intraspecific genetic distances between different mitochondrial markers, without, however, showing a consistent pattern. We conclude that cox1 allows accurate differentiation of species and as such DNA barcoding may have an important role to play in comparative primatology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nijman, V","Aliabadian, M"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":57876,"sim:weight":0.327045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844599,"sim:weight":0.287636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32132,"sim:weight":0.21268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.197189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98876,"sim:weight":0.184534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108618,"sim:weight":0.174382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62634,"sim:weight":0.172246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26936,"sim:weight":0.168764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.158785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393532,"sim:weight":0.151245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393535,"sim:weight":0.121555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98777,"sim:weight":0.113189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Data from an ongoing, longitudinal, interview study (DORIS) of 1033 new attenders at a range of Scottish drug treatment facilities were analysed, 16 months on from sample recruitment, using forward stepwise logistic regression models. Dependence was measured at baseline and in subsequent interview sweeps using the five-item Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS). In addition to drug consumption measures, a range of non-drug consumption measures were used, including those measuring housing status, employment status and criminality. Respondents\u0027 SDS scores fell significantly over time, and SDS score at 16 months was a significant independent predictor of outcome measures such as reports of acquisitive crimes. However, SDS score at baseline was not an independent predictor of either drug consumption measures at 16 months or non-drug outcomes such as criminality at 16 months. Treatment services are increasingly designed to view drug use as a chronic condition, with dependence as its core property. However, while SDS score functions as a useful outcome measure, puzzlingly, severity of dependence does not predict future drug using careers in these data, the largest longitudinal cohort of Scottish drug users ever studied. Accordingly, the implications of these findings for the conceptualisation of drug use and for services planning and delivery are both unsettling and unclear.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bloor, M","Neale, J","Weir, C","Robertson, M","McKeganey, N"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.157389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.15337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2753332,"sim:weight":0.135215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.131467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108260,"sim:weight":0.131184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266223,"sim:weight":0.126798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22782,"sim:weight":0.124052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98646,"sim:weight":0.123609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99012,"sim:weight":0.121827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.0951998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Our aims were to visualise and analyse\nthe disposal route followed by aberrant proteins within a plant cell in vivo using fluorescent protein technology.\nA green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion was detected in the cytosol and the nucleoplasm in spite of the presence of an N-terminal secretory signal peptide. In contrast to secreted GFP, the fusion protein was retained in the cells where it was degraded slowly, albeit at a rate much higher than that of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained derivative GFP-HDEL. The fusion protein could not be stabilised by\ninhibitors of transport or the cytosolic proteasome. However, the protein is a strong lumenal binding protein (BiP) ligand. Complete signal peptide processing even after long-term expression in virus-infected leaves rules out the possibility that the documented accumulation in the cytosol and nucleoplasm is because of the bypassing of the translocation pores. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the fusion protein is disposed off from the ER via a retrograde translocation back to the cytosol. Moreover, accumulation in the nucleoplasm was shown to be microtubule dependent unlike the well-documented diffusion of cytosolically expressed GFP into the nucleoplasm. The apparent active transport of the GFP fusion into the nucleoplasm may indicate an as yet undiscovered feature of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and explain the insensitivity to degradation by proteasome inhibitors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brandizzi, F","Hanton, S L","Pinto daSilva, L L","Boevink, P","Evans, D","Oparka, K","Denecke, J","Hawes, C R"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24400,"sim:weight":0.261171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584827,"sim:weight":0.239162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99284,"sim:weight":0.160281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.128259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Methods: Women completed questionnaires one month prior to screening, and one and six months after receiving screening results. Factors measured were breast cancer worry, perceived risk, cognitive appraisals, coping, dispositional optimism, and background variables relating to screening history and family history. \nResults: Pre-screening cancer worry was the most important predictor of subsequent worry,explaining 56/61% and 54/57% of the variance at one and six months follow-up, respectively. Other salient pre-screening predictors included high perceived risk of breast cancer, appraisals of high relevance and threat associated with the family history, and low perceived ability to cope emotionally. Women who had previously been part of the screening programme and those with a relative who had recently died from breast cancer were also vulnerable to longer-term distress. Afalse positive screening result, pessimistic personality, and coping efforts relating to religion and substance use predicted outcomes of screening at one month follow-up, but were not predictive in the longer-term.\nConclusion: Early intervention to ameliorate high levels of cancer-related distress and negative appraisals would benefit some women as they progress through the familial breastscreening programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brain, K","Henderson, B J","Tyndel, S","Bankhead, C","Watson, E","Clements, A","Austoker, J"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.362037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23366,"sim:weight":0.299449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.285656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.260544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.139208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23804,"sim:weight":0.127933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22782,"sim:weight":0.127429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23811,"sim:weight":0.11423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22707,"sim:weight":0.094343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Where locality data are deficient, presence-only ecological niche modelling (ENM) can provide insights into a species\u0027 potential distribution, and can aid in conservation planning. Presence-only ENM is especially important for rare, cryptic and nocturnal species, where absence is difficult to define. Here we applied ENM to carry out an anthropogenic risk assessment and set conservation priorities for three threatened species of Asian slow loris (Primates: Nycticebus).\nLocation: Borneo, Java and Sumatra, Southeast Asia.\nMethods: Distribution models were built using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) ENM. We input 20 environmental variables comprising temperature, precipitation and altitude, along with species locality data. We clipped\npredicted distributions to forest cover and altitudinal data to generate remnant distributions. These were then applied to protected area (PA) and human land-use data, using specific criteria to define low-, medium- or\nhigh-risk areas. These data were analysed to pinpoint priority study sites, suitable reintroduction zones and protected area extensions.\nResults: A jackknife validation method indicated highly significant models for all three species with small sample sizes (n \u003d 10 to 23 occurrences). The distribution models represented high habitat suitability within each species\u0027 geographical range. High-risk areas were most prevalent for the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) on Java, with the highest proportion of low-risk areas for the Bornean slow loris (N. menagensis)\non Borneo. Eighteen PA extensions and 23 priority survey sites were identified across the study region.\nMain conclusions: Discriminating areas of high habitat suitability lays the foundations for planning field studies and conservation initiatives. This study highlights potential reintroduction zones that will minimize anthropogenic threats to animals that are released. These data reiterate the conclusion of previous research, showing MaxEnt is a viable technique for modelling species distributions with small sample sizes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thorn, J","Smith, D","Nijman, V","Nekaris, K"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99304,"sim:weight":0.385159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.226234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.226233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.225676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382175,"sim:weight":0.207012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62150,"sim:weight":0.205648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62510,"sim:weight":0.205454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62279,"sim:weight":0.204796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86207,"sim:weight":0.204569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.203789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58019,"sim:weight":0.203525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97692,"sim:weight":0.184573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.18301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61873,"sim:weight":0.169255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15554,"sim:weight":0.159874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269988,"sim:weight":0.142203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15174,"sim:weight":0.132748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Method Using known population prevalence as a background probability and diagnostic accuracy information for the AUDIT scale, we calculated the post-test probability of alcohol abuse or dependence for study participants. The difference in post-test probability between the study intervention and control groups indicates the effectiveness of the intervention to reduce alcohol use disorder rates. Findings In the illustrative analysis, at 12-month follow-up there was a mean AUDIT score difference of 2.2 points between the intervention and control groups: an effect size of unclear policy relevance. Using Bayes\u0027 Theorem, the post-test probability mean difference between the two groups was 9% (95% confidence interval 3–14%). Interpreted as a prevalence reduction, this is evaluated more easily by policy makers and clinicians. Conclusion Important information on the probable differences in real world prevalence and impact of prevention and treatment programmes can be produced by applying Bayes\u0027 Theorem to studies where diagnostic outcome measures are used.

In fact, capacity models of the writing process predict that the more automated students can make the transcription process then the more resources will be available for higher order writing processes. This study examined the impact of low level handwriting processes on undergraduate writing in pressurised and unpressurised tasks. Students completed a measure of handwriting fluency and provided samples of writing from exam conditions and a formative class essay. The results indicated that, compared to a class essay, exam writing was constrained by the low level writing skill of handwriting fluency. Surprisingly, it was found that the undergraduates were very slow writers whose writing speed was equivalent to published fluency data on 11-year-old schoolchildren. The relationships between handwriting fluency and writing quality were also very similar to those of published data on 11-year-old children, with handwriting fluency accounting for large amounts of the variance in writing quality and tutor marks for exam answers. The results of the current study indicate that lower level processes constrain the higher level performance of undergraduate students to a significant extent.

The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) not only set out to help such places but also to determine whether the aid was achieving the Fund\u0027s goals. In 1999, the HLF engaged Oxford Brookes University (OBU) to undertake a multi-year evaluation of the success of the THI programme. To date, the THI has provided over 170 pound million to 175 different locations throughout the United Kingdom. In 2004, an article outlining the methodology being used by the OBU team appeared in the academic literature. Seventeen representative sites had been selected and baseline reports prepared between 1999 and 2001. In 2007, the first series of follow-up studies were completed. This article addresses three questions: was it possible to gather the data that the researchers proposed when the evaluation was planned, was it possible to use that data to evaluate the degree to which the stated HLF goals for the programme were met and, finally, in what way is the research likely to be useful to the funding agency? The article presents findings from the research that relates economic, demographic, townscape and other characteristics of places to their potential to benefit from investment in heritage at the urban scale.

A generalized version and analytical expression for this important principle have also been formulated for multiple failure modes. It is argued that the traditional approach based on a risk matrix is suitable only for single failure modes/scenarios. In the case of multiple failure modes (scenarios), the individual risks should be aggregated and compared with the maximum tolerable risk. In this respect, a new method for risk-based design is proposed, based on limiting the probability of system failure below a maximal acceptable level at a minimum total cost (the sum of the cost for building the system and the risk of failure). The essence of the method can be summarized in three steps: developing a system topology with the maximum possible reliability, reducing the resultant system to a system with generic components, for each of which several alternatives exist including non-existence of the component, and a final step involving selecting a set of alternatives limiting the probability of system failure at a minimum total cost. An exact recursive algorithm for determining the set of alternatives for the components is also proposed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Todinov, M"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":22948,"sim:weight":0.327075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99361,"sim:weight":0.317779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108345,"sim:weight":0.257706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.24561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795333,"sim:weight":0.227923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.203646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.199386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25806,"sim:weight":0.193473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931792,"sim:weight":0.185089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.135845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The experimental result presented in the paper clearly indicates that the Weibull distribution with its strictly increasing function, is incapable of approximating a constant probability of failure over a loading region. New fundamental concepts have been introduced referred to as \u0027hazard stress density\u0027 and \u0027cumulative hazard stress density\u0027. These concepts helped derive an equation giving the probability of failure without making use of the notions \u0027flaws\u0027 and \u0027locally initiated failure by flaws\u0027. As a result, the derived equation is more general than earlier models. The cumulative hazard stress density is an important fingerprint of materials and can be used for determining the reliability of loaded components. It leaves materials to \u0027speak for themselves\u0027 by not imposing a power law dependence on the variation of the critical flaws which is always the case if the Weibull model is used. An important link with earlier models has also been established. We show that the cumulative hazard stress density is numerically equal to the product of the number density of the flaws with a potential to cause failure and the probability that a flaw will be critical at the specified loading stress. We show that, predictions of the probability of failure from tests related to a small gauge length to a large gauge length are associated with large errors which increase in proportion with the ratio of the gauge lengths. Large gauge length ratios amplify the inevitable errors in the probability of failure associated with the small gauge length to a level which renders the predicted probability for failure of the large gauge length meaningless. Finally, a general integral has been derived, giving the reliability associated with time interval and random loading of a material with flaws. The integral has been validated by a Monte Carlo simulation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Todinov, M"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.282988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22948,"sim:weight":0.259043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98541,"sim:weight":0.247059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.235662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26001,"sim:weight":0.214214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.209826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27903,"sim:weight":0.204032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99089,"sim:weight":0.199304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.196249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26443,"sim:weight":0.190779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795333,"sim:weight":0.188385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26442,"sim:weight":0.182653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.1791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.178667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.177439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86116,"sim:weight":0.176025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25819,"sim:weight":0.154853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26028,"sim:weight":0.152163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We investigate which environmental factors, both biotic and abiotic, constrain the current distribution of elephants. A spatially explicit habitat model is constructed to find core areas for conservation and to assess current threats.\nLocation:\nUlu Masen Ecosystem in the province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia.\nMethods: A stratified survey was conducted at 12 sites (300 transects) to establish the presence of elephants. Presence records formed the basis to model potential habitat use. Ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) is used to describe their niche and to identify key factors shaping elephant distribution. An initial niche model was constructed to describe elephant niche structure, and a second model focused on identifying core areas only. To assess the threat of habitat encroachment, overlap between the elephants\u0027 optimal niche and the occurrence of forest encroachment is computed.\nResults:\nElephants were recorded throughout the study area from sea level to 1600 m a.s.l. The results show that the elephant niche and consequently habitat use markedly deviates from the available environment. Elephant presence was positively related to forest cover and vegetation productivity, and elephants were largely confined to valleys. A spatially explicit model showed that elephants mainly utilize forest edges. Forest encroachment occurs throughout the elephants range and was found within 80% of the elephants\u0027 ecological niche.\nMain conclusions:\nIn contrast to general opinion, elephant distribution proved to be weakly constrained by altitude, possibly because of movement routes running through mountainous areas. Elephants were often found to occupy habitat patches in and near human-dominated areas.

The distribution of fluorescent Golgi-resident N-glycan processing enzymes and matrix proteins (golgins) with specific cis-trans-Golgi sub-locations was followed by confocal microscopy during disassembly and reassembly. The first event during Golgi disassembly was the loss of trans-Golgi enzymes and golgins from Golgi membranes, followed by a sequential redistribution of medial and cis-Golgi enzymes into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whilst golgins were relocated to the ER or cytoplasm. This event was confirmed by fractionation and immuno-blotting. The sequential redistribution of Golgi components in a trans-cis sequence may highlight a novel retrograde trafficking pathway between the trans-Golgi and the ER in plants. Release of Golgi markers from the ER upon BFA washout occurred in the opposite sequence, with cis-matrix proteins labelling Golgi-like structures before cis/medial enzymes. Trans-enzyme location was preceded by trans-matrix proteins being recruited back to Golgi membranes. Our results show that Golgi disassembly and reassembly occur in a highly ordered fashion in plants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schoberer, J","Runions, J","Hawes, C","Osterrieder, A"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24400,"sim:weight":0.235121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65881,"sim:weight":0.227834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931557,"sim:weight":0.111785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.0963879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929888,"sim:weight":0.0805236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Findings from some epidemiological studies suggest that diet and nutrition may be important modifiable risk factors for development of dementia. In order to evaluate the strength of the available evidence of an association of dietary factors with dementia including Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD), we systematically searched relevant publication databases and hand-searched bibliographies up to end July 2007. We included prospective cohort studies which evaluated the association of nutrient levels with the risk of developing dementia and randomized intervention studies examining the treatment effect of nutrient supplementation on cognitive function. One hundred and sixty studies, comprising ninety one prospective cohort studies and sixty nine intervention studies, met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. Of these, thirty-three studies (19 cohort and 14 randomized controlled trials) investigated the effects of folate, B-vitamins, and levels of homocysteine (a biomarker modifiable through B-vitamin supplementation) or fish/fatty acids and are the focus of the present report. Some observational cohort studies indicated that higher dietary intake or elevated serum levels of folate and fish/fatty acids and low serum levels of homocysteine were associated with a reduced risk of incident AD and dementia, while other studies reported no association. The results of intervention studies examining the effects of folic acid or fatty acid supplementation on cognitive function are inconsistent. In summary, the available evidence is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions on the association of B vitamins and fatty acids with cognitive decline or dementia, and further long-term trials are required.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dangour, A","Whitehouse, P","Rafferty, K","Mitchell, S","Smith, L"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999745,"sim:weight":0.301013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.283376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23977,"sim:weight":0.283376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1928153,"sim:weight":0.282249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269999,"sim:weight":0.260227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.243488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65499,"sim:weight":0.223069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.209245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65506,"sim:weight":0.196654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795331,"sim:weight":0.182171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.17452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.17452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99012,"sim:weight":0.173128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9995,"sim:weight":0.171678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.171664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.165179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8747712,"sim:weight":0.164586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.159678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22742,"sim:weight":0.151267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22728,"sim:weight":0.127151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two aspects that could usefully be improved are the ability to find the sources of error in a nascent model rapidly, and the generation of tenable hypotheses concerning solutions that would improve a model.

The \u0027mirror box\u0027 creates a visual illusion, which gives rise to a visual perception of a zero lag, symmetric movement between the two arms. The study incorporated two additional visual feedback conditions by placing a glass or opaque screen between the arms. During bilateral symmetric circular arm movements mirror visual feedback induced lower neuromuscular intensities in the shoulder muscles of the less impaired arm of children with SHCP compared to the other visual conditions. In addition, the mirror lead to shorter relative durations of eccentric and concentric activity in the elbow muscles of the more impaired arm, whereas no effects of visual feedback were found in a matched control group. These results suggest that replacing veridical visual information of the more impaired arm with a mirror reflection of the less impaired arm improves the motor control of children with SHCP during interlimb coupling. The effects of the availability of visual feedback in individuals with hemiparesis are discussed with reference to: (1) increase ipsilateral motor cortex excitability and (2) congruence between afferent (visual) feedback and the internal copy of the motor commands.","bibo:AuthorList":["Feltham, M","Ledebt, A","Deconinck, F","Savelsbergh, G"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1458927,"sim:weight":0.29177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.192567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":35502,"sim:weight":0.192537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447921,"sim:weight":0.184764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844460,"sim:weight":0.159197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.149851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.131807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.125669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98611,"sim:weight":0.121812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The time taken by it is roughly proportional to the total amount of change in the edge weights of the graph. Our experiments show that, when the number of changes in the graph is small, the dynamic algorithm is significantly faster than the best known static graph cut algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a new approach in order to effectively handle high traffic load and to improve web server’s performance. Our solution is to exploit networking techniques and to classify customers’ requests into different classes such that some requests are prioritised over others. We contend that such classification is financially beneficial to E-commerce services as in these services some requests are more valuable than others. For instance, the processing of “browse” request should get less priority than “payment” request as the latter is considered to be more valuable to the service provider. Our approach analyses the arrival process of distinct requests and employs a priority scheduling service at the network nodes that gives preferential treatment to high priority requests. The proposed approach is tested through various experiments which show significant decrease in the response time of high priority requests. This also reduces the probability of dropping high priority requests by a web server and thus enabling service providers to generate more revenue.","bibo:AuthorList":["Younas, M","Awan, I","Chao, K-M","Chung, J-Y"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69286,"sim:weight":0.339472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6296,"sim:weight":0.339199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108018,"sim:weight":0.322633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844290,"sim:weight":0.291331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69321,"sim:weight":0.272314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.247042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932706,"sim:weight":0.241928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933335,"sim:weight":0.24109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933440,"sim:weight":0.239468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932989,"sim:weight":0.236235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108624,"sim:weight":0.23261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932184,"sim:weight":0.205563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.19742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934654,"sim:weight":0.186712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.17494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934843,"sim:weight":0.169013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998240,"sim:weight":0.167518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930807,"sim:weight":0.153844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91436,"sim:weight":0.140478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this paper, a fuzzy risk assessment model is developed in order to evaluate the risk of web services in a situation where complete information is not available.

It is imperative to provide service consumers with facilities for selecting required web services according to their non-functional characteristics or quality of service (QoS). However, the selection process is greatly complicated by the distinct views of service providers and consumers on the services QoS. For instance, they may have distinct views of the service reliability-wherein a consumer considers that a service is reliable if its success rate is higher than 99%, while a provider may consider its service as reliable if its success rate is higher than 90%. The aim of this paper is to resolve such conflicts and to ensure consensus on the QoS characteristics in the selection of web services. It proposes a QoS Consensus Moderation Approach (QCMA) in order to perform QoS consensus and to alleviate the differences on QoS characteristics in the selection of web services. The proposed approach is implemented as a prototype tool and is tested on a case study of a hotel booking web service. Experimental results show that the proposed approach greatly improves the service selection process in a dynamic and uncertain environment of web services.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lin, W-L","Lo, C-C","Chao, K-M","Younas, M"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5700210,"sim:weight":0.72095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108018,"sim:weight":0.483615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5842429,"sim:weight":0.471141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933407,"sim:weight":0.364232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932989,"sim:weight":0.329444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933440,"sim:weight":0.305539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933335,"sim:weight":0.301281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.293875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98840,"sim:weight":0.253522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.247682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The most common joint configuration is the lap-shear joint, which has been investigated widely and several ideas have been proposed to improve its performance. For example, the introduction of fillets at the overlap ends or tapering of the substrates can reduce the peel stresses at the overlap end. Other approaches include the use of ‘reverse-bent’ substrates and ‘wavy joints’ to reduce peel stresses. This paper compares the stress distribution of the ‘reverse-bent’ and the ‘wavy joint’, with the stresses of the traditional lap-shear joint, using finite element analysis (FEA). A parametric study was carried out showing trends influencing stresses in the adhesive layer. Experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the assumptions used in, and the findings of, the FEA. The joint strength of ‘reverse-bent’ joints was found to be up to 40% higher compared to flat joints using various substrate materials, adhesives and overlap lengths.","bibo:AuthorList":["Broughton, J G","Fessel, G","Fellows, N A","Durodola, J F"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.492433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26504,"sim:weight":0.425095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.385595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495457,"sim:weight":0.350064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23209,"sim:weight":0.335568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31453,"sim:weight":0.284182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26503,"sim:weight":0.277826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5846375,"sim:weight":0.262145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26461,"sim:weight":0.245281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26003,"sim:weight":0.198549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98541,"sim:weight":0.164421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24911,"sim:weight":0.161432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.149823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.147188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98581,"sim:weight":0.133097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18164,"sim:weight":0.133009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Given the video streams acquired by two synchronized cameras the proposed algorithm synthesises images from a virtual camera in arbitrary position near the physical cameras. The new technique is based on an improved, dynamic-programming, stereo algorithm for efficient novel view generation. The two main contributions of this paper are: (i) a new four state matching graph for dense stereo dynamic programming, that supports accurate occlusion labelling; (ii) a compact geometric derivation for novel view synthesis by direct projection of the minimum cost surface. Furthermore, the paper presents an algorithm for the temporal maintenance of a background model to enhance the rendering of occlusions and reduce temporal artefacts (flicker); and a cost aggregation algorithm that acts directly in the three-dimensional matching cost space. The proposed algorithm has been designed to work with input images with large disparity range, a common practical situation. The enhanced occlusion handling capabilities of the new dynamic programming algorithm are evaluated against those of the most powerful state-of-the-art dynamic programming and graph-cut techniques. Four-state DP is also evaluated against the disparity-based Middlebury error metrics and its performance found to be amongst the best of the efficient algorithms. A number of examples demonstrate the robustness of four-state DP to artefacts in stereo video streams. This includes demonstrations of cyclopean view synthesis in extended conversational sequences, synthesis from a freely translating virtual camera and, finally, basic 3D scene editing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Criminisi, A","Blake, A","Rother, C","Shotton, J","Torr, P H"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":21188,"sim:weight":0.408419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":241187,"sim:weight":0.368546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56544,"sim:weight":0.295674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929808,"sim:weight":0.265715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86026,"sim:weight":0.234919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340552,"sim:weight":0.222274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98450,"sim:weight":0.221081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653040,"sim:weight":0.203858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147453,"sim:weight":0.203662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98583,"sim:weight":0.194055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23975,"sim:weight":0.192011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931836,"sim:weight":0.183939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931810,"sim:weight":0.183881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176864,"sim:weight":0.181113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734386,"sim:weight":0.179301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269940,"sim:weight":0.167667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98746,"sim:weight":0.151635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932895,"sim:weight":0.135446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

MRI studies have shown muscle morbidity in cervical cancer and prostate cancer. In breast cancer clinical observations and patient reports include muscle morbidity in a number of muscles acting at the shoulder. Several of these muscles lie in the field of surgery and radiotherapy. Timed interaction between muscles that stabilise the shoulder and those acting as prime movers is essential to achieve a smooth scapulohumeral rthythm during functional elevation of the arm.\nMethod: Cross-sectional study\nSeventy-four women treated for unilateral carcinoma of the breast were included in the study. All patients filled out the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). EMG activity of four muscles was recorded during scaption on the affected and unaffected side. Muscle cross sectional area and signal intensity was determined from MRI scans. The association between EMG and covariates was determined using multiple linear regression techniques.\nResults\nThree of the 4 muscles on the affected side demonstrated significantly less EMG activity, particularly when lowering the arm. Upper trapezius demonstrated the greatest loss in activity. Decreased activity in both upper trapezius and rhomboid were significantly associated with an increase in SPADI score and increased time since surgery. Pectoralis major and minor were significantly smaller on the affected side.\nConclusion\nMuscles affected in the long term are the muscles associated with pain and disability yet are not in the direct field of surgery or radiotherapy. Primary muscle shortening and secondary loss of muscle activity may be producing a movement disorder similar to the ‘Dropped Shoulder Syndrome’. Exercise programmes should aim not only for range of movement but also for posture correction and education of potential long-term effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shamley, D R","Srinanaganathan, R","Weatherall, R","Watson, M","Ostlere, S","Sugden, E"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":35502,"sim:weight":0.30146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.301444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99057,"sim:weight":0.251509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.216696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99126,"sim:weight":0.207413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.189509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99487,"sim:weight":0.187405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.181752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.162863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.157405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269991,"sim:weight":0.149716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98479,"sim:weight":0.142879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99077,"sim:weight":0.12156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The shape of each segment is represented using a binary matte and its appearance is given by the rgb value for each point belonging to the matte. Included in the model are the effects of image projection, lighting, and motion blur. Furthermore, spatial continuity is explicitly modeled resulting in contiguous segments. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not use reference frame(s) for initialization. The two main contributions of our method are: (i) A novel algorithm for obtaining the initial estimate of the model by dividing the scene into rigidly moving components using efficient loopy belief propagation; and (ii) Refining the initial estimate using α β-swap and α-expansion algorithms, which guarantee a strong local minima.

In contrast to traditional dense stereo where the parametrization is image based, here we advocate a parametrization by a height field over any base surface. In practice, the base surface is a coarse approximation to the true geometry, e.g., a bounding box, visual hull or triangulation of sparse correspondences, and is assigned or computed using other means. A dense set of sample points is defined on the base surface, each with a fixed normal direction and unknown height value. The estimation of heights for the sample points is achieved by a belief propagation technique.

It is the first world history of eugenics and an indispensable core text for both teaching and research in what has become a sprawling but ever more important field. Eugenics has accumulated generations of interest as part of the question of how experts think about the connections between biology, human capacity and policy. In the past and the present, eugenics speaks to questions of race, class, gender and sex, evolution, governance, nationalism, disability, and the social implications of science. In the current climate, where the human genome project, stem cell research, and new reproductive technologies have proven so controversial, the history of eugenics has much to teach us about the relationship between scientific research, technology, and human ethical decision-making.\nThis volume offers both a nineteenth-century context for understanding the emergence of eugenics and a consideration of contemporary manifestations of, and relationships to eugenics. It is the definitive text for students and researchers to consult for careful and up-to-date summaries, new substantive fields where very little work is currently available (e.g. eugenics in Iran, South Africa, and South East Asia); transnational thematic lines of inquiry; the integration of literature on colonialism; and connections to contemporary issues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turda, M"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Bringing together contributions from internationally acknowledged\nexperts, the book highlights themes, current issues and key debates in the history of deviance and bad behaviour, including:\n■ marital cruelty and adultery\n■ infanticide\n■ murder\n■ the underworld\n■ blasphemy and moral crimes\n■ fraud and white-collar crime\n■ the death penalty and punishment.\nIndividual case studies of violent and non-violent crime are used to explore the human means and motives behind criminal practice. Through these, the book illuminates society\u0027s wider attitudes and fears about criminal behaviour and the way in which these influence the law and legal system over time. This fascinating book is essential reading for students and teachers of history, sociology and criminology, as well as anyone interested in Britain\u0027s criminal past.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kilday, A-M","Nash, D"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Consequently, a variety of initiatives and projects are being undertaken aimed at improving assessment. However, many of the concepts and theories underpinning assessment practice are complex and interrelated, which can mean that relatively simple and apparently minor changes can have major, and often unintended, consequences. This paper was initially prepared to foreground an internal document providing diagnosis and recommendations for change to assessment strategy and policy in a post‐1992 university. It draws on a wide body of literature and research studies to distil and discuss key issues, which should inform assessment decisions. These key issues provide a framework to examine assessment policy and practice and enable the alignment of assessment policy with the beliefs and values of an institution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Price, M","Carroll, J","O\u0027Donovan, B","Rust, C"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A historical analysis of existing provisions aimed at legislating against racial hatred and blasphemy is adopted, in order to determine whether the creation of this new offence is justified and necessary. We conclude that although the new offence may fulfil an important symbolic role in a post September 11th environment, in its current form the legislation has not taken sufficient account of the precedent of racial hatred and blasphemy laws, or of more general questions about the criminalisation of hatred.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nash, D","Bakalis, C"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

While considering the nature of the population of dyslexic students as a whole, it also looked for potential sub-groups with a view to differentiating support needs and usage.\nThe research considered data for past dyslexic students of the institution, over nearly a decade, in the context of national data (HESA and UCAS) to establish the nature of the population being investigated. A range of measures were completed by current students of the institution, addressing: aspects of experiences of dyslexia; personality; learning mode preferences; and support use, including DSA Needs Assessment recommendations. These findings, in conjunction with WAIS intelligence test indices scores (where available from\ndyslexia assessments), were statistically analysed where appropriate. The research concluded with interviews of selected participants.\nThe main findings included a trend of late identification of women. Evidence of the impact of dyslexia recognition and support during compulsory schooling was seen in subsequent support use and outcomes. How students attributed outcomes at school was important for self-concept and motivation, although this was not always related to recognition of dyslexia or support. The Perceptual Organisation Index of the WAIS-III test was central to grouping participant cases. Patterns were seen in use of higher education support, relating to age of identification as dyslexic, age when starting the course and\ngender.\nThe implications include the way Learning Mode preference awareness has a role in developing self-awareness and meta-cognitive skill. Study environment requirements are an area of student needs that would benefit from further investigation. Feedback on Needs Assessment recommendations highlights the need for more training opportunities and better ways to introduce students to assistive technology before recommendations were made. Better understanding of support use patterns has implications for support resource\nmanagement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Eld, M"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Accordingly, the text assumes a certain level of basic knowledge about the English jurisdiction, and English traditions in law-making. The discussion of criminal law and procedure aims to be comparative, seeking to bring out those areas where Manx law and English law may differ, rather than detailing areas of similarity. This Part of the text, in particular, might well appear incomprehensible to those coming from other disciplines, including those with a general interest in Manx culture, rather than Manx law.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edge, P"],"dc:date":"1997","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We conducted a study on the Panamanian owl monkey (Aotus\nzonalis) between May and July 2008 at three localities in Chagres National Park, located east of the Panama Canal, using the line transect method to quantify abundance and distribution. Vegetation surveys were also conducted to provide a baseline quantification of the three habitat types. We observed 33 individuals within 16 groups in two out of the three sites. Population density was highest in Campo Chagres with 19.7 individuals/km2 and intermediate densities of 14.3 individuals/km2 were observed at Cerro Azul. In la Llana A. zonalis was not found to be present. The presence of A. zonalis in Chagres National Park, albeit\nat seemingly low abundance, is encouraging.

It looks to the debates surrounding constituent power – the ‘power of the people’ – in order to understand different possibilities for the discourse. Using continental political philosophy and critical legal theory, Human Rights and Constituent Power presents a very different conception of human rights, more at home on the riotous streets than in courtrooms and parliaments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wall, I"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is the most important initiative to monitor and regulate the international trade of wildlife but its credibility is dependent on the quality of the trade data. We report on the performance of CITES reporting by focussing on the commercial trade in non-native reptiles and amphibians into Thailand as to illustrate trends, species composition and numbers of wild-caught vs. captive-bred specimens.\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nBased on data in the WCMC-CITES trade database, we establish that a total of 75,594 individuals of 169 species of reptiles and amphibians (including 27 globally threatened species) were imported into Thailand in 1990–2007. The majority of individuals (59,895, 79%) were listed as captive-bred and a smaller number (15,699, 21%) as wild-caught. In the 1990s small numbers of individuals of a few species were imported into Thailand, but in 2003 both volumes and species diversity increased rapidly. The proportion of captive-bred animals differed greatly between years (from 0 to \u003e80%). Wild-caught individuals were mainly sourced from African countries, and captive-bred individuals from Asian countries (including from non-CITES Parties). There were significant discrepancies between exports and imports. Thailand reports the import of \u003e10,000 individuals (51 species) originating from Kazakhstan, but Kazakhstan reports no exports of these species. Similar discrepancies, involving smaller numbers (\u003e100 individuals of 9 species), can be seen in the import of reptiles into Thailand via Macao.\nConclusion/Significance\nWhile there has been an increase in imports of amphibian and reptiles into Thailand, erratic patterns in proportions of captive-bred specimens and volumes suggests either capricious markets or errors in reporting. Large discrepancies with respect to origin point to misreporting or possible violations of the rules and intentions of CITES.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nijman, V","Shepherd, C R"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90542,"sim:weight":0.309351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60125,"sim:weight":0.249782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62227,"sim:weight":0.228377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86207,"sim:weight":0.184032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58019,"sim:weight":0.171893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382175,"sim:weight":0.170725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382177,"sim:weight":0.169635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97600,"sim:weight":0.165693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.164273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.164273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.162219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.162219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.156438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60055,"sim:weight":0.156061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58415,"sim:weight":0.144967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99092,"sim:weight":0.134012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15174,"sim:weight":0.120095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108766,"sim:weight":0.101923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26013,"sim:weight":0.0893193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26012,"sim:weight":0.0893193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The public act of a wedding for these groups is not only exclusive, we argue, but pays little heed to the private needs of participants nor the private ritual significance such acts necessarily include. Moreover, the exclusion of religious elements is both difficult to interpret and police. We examine the nature and limitations of the provisions and guidance on the Civil Partnership Act and argue that maintenance of a standardised secularism within public law, as in marriage law and the Civil Partnership Act, is anachronous in a modern plural state. This article challenges the division between public secular acts and private acts of ritual and personal significance. We suggest that private actors import religious elements and meanings into secular ceremonies and that guidance to registrars officiating in civil ceremonies does not provide absolute prohibitions to couples using religiously significant elements of ritual or practice. We conclude that the Act continues practices of unjustified differential treatment and that reform to a more inclusive legal framework is both possible and necessary.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edge, P","Corrywright, D"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1558568,"sim:weight":0.434983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96409,"sim:weight":0.376223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84888,"sim:weight":0.317074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107053,"sim:weight":0.315381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76118,"sim:weight":0.303954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.280912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108203,"sim:weight":0.272687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77960,"sim:weight":0.27066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77596,"sim:weight":0.247302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445930,"sim:weight":0.245648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99216,"sim:weight":0.241834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176810,"sim:weight":0.24062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.234779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.201926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58704,"sim:weight":0.19187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.190342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.182245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.182245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.152644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Understanding Walking and Cycling (UWAC) project, funded by the EPSRC, has examined the factors influencing everyday travel decisions and proposes a series of policy measures to increase levels of walking and cycling for short trips in urban areas. A wide range of both quantitative and qualitative data were collected in four English towns (Lancaster, Leeds, Leicester and Worcester), including a questionnaire survey, spatial analysis of the built environment, interviews (static and whilst mobile) and detailed ethnographies. Key findings of the research are that whilst attitudes to walking and cycling are mostly positive or neutral, many people who would like to engage in more active travel fail to do so due to a combination of factors. These can be summarised as:\nConcerns about the physical environment, especially with regard to safety when walking or cycling;\nThe difficulty of fitting walking and cycling into complex household routines\n(especially with young children);\nThe perception that walking and cycling are in some ways abnormal things to do. It is suggested that policies to increase levels of walking and cycling should focus not only on improving infrastructure (for instance through fully segregated cycle routes along main roads and restriction on vehicle speeds), but also must tackle broader social, economic, cultural and legal factors that currently inhibit walking and cycling. Together, such changes can create an environment in which driving for short trips in urban areas is seen as abnormal and walking or cycling seem the obvious choices.

This article explores the re-emergence of a sacrificial imaginary in Canadian culture through an examination of seemingly irreconcilable accounts that have emerged of the Canadian security state – one that reads ‘Canada’ through the story of the torture and repatriation of Canadian citizen, Maher Arar, and one that tells the story of ‘Canada at War’ through the warrior\u0027s return. It examines both in terms of the tensions and instabilities they reveal in the Western liberal imaginary and in terms of the ways in which they collectively operate to redefine the aesthetic borders of the Canadian political community.

The book\u0027s title is borrowed from McLuhan\u0027s apt metaphor, but questions its underlying assumptions. The contributors recast some of the basic elements of the complex phenomenon of the so-called globalization. Trade laws, industrial relations, economic and political systems are analyzed in a critical perspective. Moreover, environment and sustainable development, languages\u0027 rights, education, mobility and migrations are discussed in view of contemporary changes that societies are undergoing throughout the world. The vulnerability of societies caught up in new networks of interdependence due to reduced distances also are put to the fore, in the context of the new accelerated circulation of information, ideas, goods, and human beings. Provacative reading for scholars interested in a multinational, Euro-Atlanticist perspective on globalization.\nThe international discourse is most recently focused on some negative outgrowths of world economy, especially after the Seattle Round (December 1999) and its unexpected uprising of protests. The researches of the Center for Euro-Atlantic Studies (University of Genoa), in cooperation with scholars from Europe, Canada and the United States, offer in this collection of essays a multinational contribution which is part of their work in progress on the multifaceted issue of the contemporary global village. The book features some optimistic outcomes, and some worries about what the new millennium will not achieve, despite the common and transnational efforts, that is to say a fair re-distribution of resources to reach what R. W. Fogel defines a post-modern equality, based on values as well as on material wealth. In sum, the essayists wonder if some of the hidden promises of globalization will develop in a better new century.","bibo:AuthorList":["Axford, B"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.342316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.316129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.316101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":658869,"sim:weight":0.292492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.282213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447739,"sim:weight":0.278886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89658,"sim:weight":0.267301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.2646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.256215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.223191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.178721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930821,"sim:weight":0.175665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It assesses whether a plan or project, ‘in combination’, could affect the ‘integrity’ of sites of international nature conservation importance in Europe. It is very precautionary: plans or projects that could affect site integrity may not be adopted unless a series of stringent requirements—testing of alternatives, proof of overriding need, and provision of compensation—are met.\nAppropriate assessment of plans began to be carried out in England in early 2006. Since then, various guidance documents have been published, but there is still considerable debate about just what methodology should be used, how to test impacts on site ‘integrity’, what avoidance and mitigation measures are adequate, who should be responsible for these measures etc., and even about what the process should be called. The first legal challenges based on appropriate assessment of plans are emerging.\nAppropriate assessments are showing that many English plans could affect European sites, either directly through land take, or indirectly by, for instance, reducing water levels or increasing recreational disturbance. The question now is how to respond to the clash between people\u0027s aspirations for new homes and economic growth, and wildlife conservation. This article discusses the legal requirements and emerging guidance on appropriate assessment of plans in England, how it relates to strategic environmental assessment, the current status of these assessments, and emerging issues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Therivel, R"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":56186,"sim:weight":0.386032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84377,"sim:weight":0.260212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84647,"sim:weight":0.253263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.248339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63476,"sim:weight":0.246302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89869,"sim:weight":0.243568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382177,"sim:weight":0.242996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84388,"sim:weight":0.238153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84635,"sim:weight":0.230392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.22152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84410,"sim:weight":0.218934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84240,"sim:weight":0.217708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.216957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14762,"sim:weight":0.206995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58415,"sim:weight":0.201063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382175,"sim:weight":0.200225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58126,"sim:weight":0.198583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58019,"sim:weight":0.198509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61873,"sim:weight":0.192977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84299,"sim:weight":0.188787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

But little attention has been paid to how NHRIs actually apply treaty standards at the national level. This article argues that recent innovations in human rights treaties—whereby national-level institutions are assigned an explicit role in treaty implementation—crystallise developments in the practice of NHRIs and treaty bodies over the past 15 years or so. NHRIs invoke international standards in their monitoring and case-handling, they audit legislation for compliance with international law and, after an initial period of unclarity, they have become increasingly involved in independent reporting to treaty monitoring bodies. An analysis of 69 founding statutes of NHRIs shows a growing trend to assign these institutions mandates derived from international standards. Despite some marginal differences in the practice of NHRIs in ‘monist’ and ‘dualist’ jurisdictions, traditional doctrinal distinctions in the incorporation of international law appear to have little impact on the role that these institutions play.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carver, R"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176810,"sim:weight":0.390745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100174,"sim:weight":0.311804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85632,"sim:weight":0.292596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929884,"sim:weight":0.282849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99223,"sim:weight":0.274316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99009,"sim:weight":0.269509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108067,"sim:weight":0.230421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85570,"sim:weight":0.22772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108926,"sim:weight":0.195612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269950,"sim:weight":0.190578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Memory had long been held to be part of the consciousness that divided humans from the animal world, but mid-nineteenth-century scientific theories questioned what part there remained for the moral and spiritual in the physiological operations of the brain. The exegetical, devotional and liturgical practices of the Christian Church had been predicated upon a particular understanding of the part played by memory in spiritual development, and this way of thinking was harder to discard than the dogma for those educated within its traditions. George Eliot’s desire to retain a spiritual role for memory within a physiological account of its workings can be seen both in her protagonists’ moral development and in the reading habits her fiction endeavours to foster. In the firmly post-Darwinian world of Hardy’s Jude the Obscure, memory can no longer be held to act as a moral force, but Hardy continues to blame and lament Christian epistemology for its false promise. Modernist fiction reflected recent physiological and psychological thinking in representing memory as less susceptible to personal control and so drained it of moral significance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jay, E"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Instead of summarizing existing knowledge scholars working in the field aim at opening fresh discussion; instead of emphasizing settled consensus they direct their readers to areas of enlivened and unresolved debate.\nThe deepest periodic division in English literary history has been between the medieval and the early modern, not least because the cultural investments in maintaining that division are exceptionally powerful. Narratives of national and religious identity and freedom; of individual liberties; of the history of education and scholarship; of reading or the history of the book; of the very possibility of persuasive historical consciousness itself: each of these narratives (and more) is motivated by positing a powerful break around 1500.\nNone of the claims for a profound historical and cultural break at the turn of the fifteenth into the sixteenth centuries is negligible. The very habit of working within those periodic bounds (either medieval or early modern) tends, however, simultaneously to affirm and to ignore the rupture. It affirms the rupture by staying within standard periodic bounds, but it ignores it by never examining the rupture itself. The moment of profound change is either, for medievalists, just over an unexplored horizon; or, for Early Modernists, a zero point behind which more penetrating examination is unnecessary. That situation is now rapidly changing. Scholars are building bridges that link previously insular areas. Both periods are starting to look different in dialogue with each other.\nThe change underway has yet to find collected voices behind it. Cultural Reformations volume aims to provide those voices.

Compared to present low encounter rates of orangutans, it is striking how many orangutan each day historic collectors like Alfred Russel Wallace were able to shoot continuously over weeks or even months. Does that indicate that some 150 years ago encounter rates with orangutans, or their densities, were higher than now?\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe test this hypothesis by quantifying encounter rates obtained from hunting accounts, museum collections, and recent field studies, and analysing whether there is a declining trend over time. Logistic regression analyses of our data support such a decline on Borneo between the mid-19th century and the present. Even when controlled for variation in the size of survey and hunting teams and the durations of expeditions, mean daily encounter rates appear to have declined about 6-fold in areas with little or no forest disturbance.\nConclusions/Significance\nThis finding has potential consequences for our understanding of orangutans, because it suggests that Bornean orangutans once occurred at higher densities. We explore potential explanations—habitat loss and degradation, hunting, and disease—and conclude that hunting fits the observed patterns best. This suggests that hunting has been underestimated as a key causal factor of orangutan density and distribution, and that species population declines have been more severe than previously estimated based on habitat loss only. Our findings may require us to rethink the biology of orangutans, with much of our ecological understanding possibly being based on field studies of animals living at lower densities than they did historically. Our approach of quantifying species encounter rates from historic data demonstrates that this method can yield valuable information about the ecology and population density of species in the past, providing new insight into species\u0027 conservation needs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meijaard, E","Welsh, A","Ancrenaz, M","Wich, S A","Nijman, V","Marshall, A J"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Importantly, three-dimensional domains of gene expression can be analyzed with single-cell precision. We used this technique for a detailed examination of phloem cells in the wild type and mutants. We were also able to recognize phloem sieve elements and their differentiation state in any tissue type and visualize the structure of sieve plates. We show that in the altered phloem development mutant, a hybrid cell type with phloem and xylem characteristics develops from initially normally differentiated protophloem cells. The simplicity of sieve element data collection allows for the statistical analysis of structural parameters of sieve plates, essential for the calculation of phloem conductivity. Taken together, this technique significantly improves the speed and accuracy of the investigation of plant growth and development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barthelemy, J","Palauqui, J","Truernit, E","Bauby, H","Dubreucq, B","Grandjean, O","Runions, J"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.197997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98959,"sim:weight":0.173603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266832,"sim:weight":0.162919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24401,"sim:weight":0.133433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98849,"sim:weight":0.123341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99061,"sim:weight":0.0728471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At the same time, the multi-directional focus of the current identity literature, together with the rather loose application of the term “identity”, leaves some observers sceptical about the validity and utility of identity as an analytical concept. With this backdrop, the article seeks to articulate an essential mechanism by which identity functions as a source of a state\u0027s foreign policy: A concept of state identity generates a specific value (a pro attitude toward a certain kind of action), which in turn determines a state\u0027s preference for a particular foreign policy option. This causal mechanism is then demonstrated by the empirical analysis of Japan\u0027s foreign policy toward post-Cold War regional institution-building. Further, by placing the identity mechanism within the value-action framework of general foreign policy, the study raises concern about the conditions by which identity becomes a prominent factor, that is to say when identity matters. Along this line, the study highlights the context-dependent and versatile natures of identity\u0027s function, and therefore, it cautions against overly deterministic approaches toward the role of identity in foreign policy and international relations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ashizawa, K"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Any Romantic sanitization of Ireland’s rugged terrain for the purposes of tourism belied the fractious memorial inheritances of the country’s disenfranchised population. Indeed, the Gothic had emerged, at least in part, to serve as a form of exfoliant of past injustice; as Leslie Fiedler observes, the Gothic “had been invented to deal with the past and with history from a typically Protestant and enlightened point of view.” 2 Fiedler’s point resonates with both late nineteenth- and late twentieth-century narrations of Irish history.\nThe Gothic in Ireland reveals that the past is not easily confined to the composed rhetoric and streamlined contours of historical writing. The Irish landscape, punctuated with the fragments of edifices, bespeaks a culture of discontinuous and unsettled histories. Political writings and speeches before and during the nineteenth century frequently figure Ireland as a haunted country. For example, William O’Brien’s speech before the Cork Young Ireland Society in 1885 is saturated in Gothic rhetoric. O’Brien invokes the dead generations, and asserts defiantly that\nWhen the framers of the penal laws denied us books, and drew their thick black veil over Irish history, they forgot that the ruins they had themselves made were the most eloquent schoolmasters, the most stupendous memorials of a history and a race that were destined not to die.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flannery, E"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109083,"sim:weight":0.309609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929875,"sim:weight":0.309384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108250,"sim:weight":0.290442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1395099,"sim:weight":0.230099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.229809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734362,"sim:weight":0.205656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.201315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.201069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108972,"sim:weight":0.196324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.192531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.192204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109172,"sim:weight":0.19215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316069,"sim:weight":0.177036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98801,"sim:weight":0.171303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98728,"sim:weight":0.164573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109002,"sim:weight":0.151262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This sheds light on both special purpose structures and “domestic” settlement, allowing fresh insights into the development of increasingly sedentary communities and the social systems they supported. The development of sedentary communities is a central part of the Neolithic process in Southwest Asia. Architecture and ideas of homes and households have been important to the debate, although there has also been considerable discussion on the role of communal buildings and the organization of early sedentarizing communities since the discovery of the tower at Jericho. Recently, the focus has been on either northern Levantine PPNA sites, such as Jerf el Ahmar, or the emergence of ritual buildings in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B of the southern Levant. Much of the debate revolves around a division between what is interpreted as domestic space, contrasted with “special purpose” buildings. Our recent evidence allows a fresh examination of the nature of early Neolithic communities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Finlayson, B","Mithen, S","Najjar, M","Smith, S","Maričević, D","Pankhurst, N","Yeomans, L"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":65999,"sim:weight":0.486324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65434,"sim:weight":0.482112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":267579,"sim:weight":0.440302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1458977,"sim:weight":0.398191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29210,"sim:weight":0.36759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266282,"sim:weight":0.330846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270450,"sim:weight":0.226527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65960,"sim:weight":0.206718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108609,"sim:weight":0.201577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15353,"sim:weight":0.201308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109144,"sim:weight":0.199569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109121,"sim:weight":0.196006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1459030,"sim:weight":0.183162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108591,"sim:weight":0.178259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108593,"sim:weight":0.177607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86193,"sim:weight":0.172069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109096,"sim:weight":0.166514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108546,"sim:weight":0.164384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108550,"sim:weight":0.163383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90566,"sim:weight":0.161246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

How many institutions does it take to protect human rights? – Lessons from the European experience","bibo:abstract":"The question of whether to establish a single national human rights institution (NHRI) with a broad mandate or multiple specialized institutions is a pressing one in several European countries, yet has been largely neglected in the academic literature. Many states have gradually acquired specialized institutions, addressing particular grounds of discrimination or the rights of different vulnerable groups. Often for reasons of cost, the wisdom of having many institutions is being questioned, and several countries – the United Kingdom (UK), Sweden, Croatia, for example – have merged multiple institutions or are considering such a step.\nInternational and European human rights standards provide little guidance on the choice between single and multiple institutions, meaning that the decision is essentially a pragmatic one. On several grounds a single NHRI is likely to prove more able to protect and promote the rights of vulnerable groups. It will provide a unified legal framework, be cost-effective, be readily accessible to those who need to use it, and present a clear profile to the public and to the authorities.\nAdvocates of multiple institutions correctly point to the need for human rights bodies that are sensitive to the particular needs of different vulnerable groups and politically and culturally accessible. Yet the reality is that not all vulnerable groups can benefit from such separate institutions and the economies provided by a single institution with a broad mandate will provide the best service, provided that they come with inbuilt guarantees of attention to the interests of all groups.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carver, R"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176810,"sim:weight":0.374138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99308,"sim:weight":0.328082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.327496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266688,"sim:weight":0.282478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108067,"sim:weight":0.249104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104012,"sim:weight":0.23249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.231147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90432,"sim:weight":0.228783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269950,"sim:weight":0.213986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is particularly relevant for large-scale, whole-house refurbishment programmes tasked with achieving deep cuts in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Evidence from pre-refurbishment occupancy can influence which interventions are chosen and increase their efficacy. A critical review is undertaken of a portfolio of short- and long-term occupant feedback techniques for evaluating occupants\u0027 perception of comfort, satisfaction, behaviour, and expectations. A number of these occupant feedback techniques are then tested empirically at the pre-refurbishment stage for two discrete case-study house types as part of ongoing research. The evidence reveals wide gaps between modelled and actual energy consumption; poor indoor CO2 and daylight levels, low operating internal temperatures, as well as problematic noise transmission. Such findings influence the selection of suitable user-centred low-carbon refurbishment interventions and ensure that there is a robust learning process for building owners, occupants, designers, and building managers. To optimize time, cost, and occupant involvement, it is important that feedback from occupants on building performance focuses on \u0027need-to-know\u0027 rather than \u0027nice-to-have\u0027 factors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chandiwala, S","Gupta, R"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.226788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271233,"sim:weight":0.207709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.175097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.171034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98594,"sim:weight":0.161758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67390,"sim:weight":0.156334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90036,"sim:weight":0.141736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25055,"sim:weight":0.135864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12702,"sim:weight":0.118652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107788,"sim:weight":0.117838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.100787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Within this context, it is possible to see that Tyndale was not a Lollard, and yet his work displays a clear and unambiguous engagement with many of Lollardy\u0027s central concerns, including the aspiration that individual Christians study scripture and debate with fellow believers its meaning as it relates to the godly life.

Harcourt (1999) hypothesized that in insular Southeast Asia, slow lorises and tarsiers showed a checkerboard distribution on 12 small (\u003c12,000 km2) islands, i.e., only one or the other occurs, and attributed this to extreme levels of competition between these 2 largely faunivorous primates. Further, he predicted slow lorises were able to persist on smaller islands than tarsiers. We re-evaluated these findings using an expanded dataset including 49 islands where tarsiers or slow lorises occur. Tarsiers and slow lorises live on islands of similar size (median size of ca. 300–900 km2), and both taxa inhabit an equal proportion of small, medium, and large islands. On small islands within their area of sympatry tarsiers occur on 1 island, slow lorises on 8, both genera on 3, and we can assume they have become extinct from 11 small islands since the Last Glacial Maximum. Sizes of islands where tarsiers or slow lorises have become extinct do not differ from islands where they are still extant. We show that slow lorises occur on more islands in insular Southeast Asia than perhaps previously assumed, but these islands are not smaller on average than islands where tarsiers occur. A checkerboard distribution between these taxa is not evident. More studies are needed at the macroecological level to assess the importance of biogeographic history in explaining their present-day distribution patterns.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nijman, V","Nekaris, K"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":64159,"sim:weight":0.153888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385536,"sim:weight":0.132906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62602,"sim:weight":0.129596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.120899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.117339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.117339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86207,"sim:weight":0.106047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59935,"sim:weight":0.103159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269921,"sim:weight":0.0984946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108618,"sim:weight":0.0938871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108684,"sim:weight":0.0923868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31144,"sim:weight":0.0906092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99304,"sim:weight":0.0895901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.0832616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26935,"sim:weight":0.0726932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85198,"sim:weight":0.0694638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This hard law response to the power of sacred places was dropped following a negative consultation, where respondents stressed the impact on, to use United States (“U.S.”) terminology, the free exercise of religion. Instead, the U.K. government has sought to exercise soft power to effect theological change in some Islamic communities – again to use U.S. terminology, moving from restricting free exercise to establishing religion. Although the latter strategy avoids a frank conflict with religious rights, it risks creating the establishment of religion through an Anglican Islam. Such an establishment would not be unconstitutional in U.K. terms, but does merit greater public discussion than has currently been the case, particularly since the form of establishment being adopted seems considerably more intrusive to the established religious community than the current establishment of the Church of England.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edge, P"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.299355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108348,"sim:weight":0.271644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176810,"sim:weight":0.259173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929831,"sim:weight":0.255961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.251576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23349,"sim:weight":0.224384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86060,"sim:weight":0.214774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107298,"sim:weight":0.199891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108965,"sim:weight":0.181691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98927,"sim:weight":0.132695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, labelling has been accused of distorting competitive conditions by promoting discrimination between imported and domestic like products and by misleading consumers about certain types of products. The problem is qualitatively different from other types of trade dispute because labelling speaks directly to the consumer and her role within freely operating markets. The conflict has become entrenched in textual and ideological disagreements and demands a new approach that acknowledges the importance of providing consumers with information about the environmental implications of their purchasing decisions, while continuing to protect the rights of exporting WTO Members. This article explores the nature of consumer information labelling in regulatory theory and environmental law and policy, and develops an analytical framework that may help to break the current deadlock. This points towards the use of a proportionality approach with particular emphasis on the distance between consumers and the transboundary impacts of their purchasing choices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cheyne, I"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":71886,"sim:weight":0.270384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109132,"sim:weight":0.236565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108980,"sim:weight":0.223895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108539,"sim:weight":0.205845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.204448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2752605,"sim:weight":0.185926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67097,"sim:weight":0.174662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85356,"sim:weight":0.166096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98762,"sim:weight":0.164082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Chaotic systems are unstable and aperiodic, making them naturally harder to identify and to predict. Recently, many researchers have been looking at ways to utilize the characteristics of chaos in communication systems and have actually achieved quite remarkable results. This field of communication is called chaotic communication. Chaotic communication signals are spread spectrum signals, which utilize large bandwidth and have low power spectrum density. In traditional communication systems, the analogue sample functions sent through the channel are weight sums of sinusoid waveforms and are linear. However, in chaotic communication systems, the samples are segments of chaotic waveforms and are nonlinear. This nonlinear, unstable and aperiodic characteristic of chaotic communication has numerous features that make it attractive for communication use. It has wideband characteristic, it is resistant against multi-path fading and it offers a cheaper solution to traditional spread spectrum systems. In chaotic communications, the digital information to be transmitted is placed directly onto a wide-band chaotic signal. This paper provides an overview of chaotic communication, chaotic modulation schemes such as: chaos shift keying (CSK), differential chaos shift keying (DSK), additive chaos modulation (ACM) and multiplicative chaos modulation (MCM). Synchronized chaotic systems and direct chaotic communication are also described in this paper.","bibo:AuthorList":["Riaz, A","Ali, M"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The slow progressive chemical recombination of ceramics with environmental moisture (rehydroxylation) provides the basis for archaeological dating. Rehydroxylation rates are described by a (time)1/4 power law. A ceramic sample may be dated by first heating it to determine its lifetime water mass gain, and then exposing it to water vapour to measure its mass gain rate and hence its individual rehydroxylation kinetic constant. The kinetic constant depends on temperature. Mean lifetime temperatures are estimated from historical meteorological data. Calculated ages of samples of established provenance from Roman to modern dates agree excellently with assigned (known) ages. This agreement shows that the power law holds precisely on millennial time scales. The power law exponent is accurately 1 4, consistent with the theory of fractional (anomalous) ‘single-file’ diffusion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, M","Carter, M","Hall, C","Hoff, W","Ince, C","Savage, S","McKay, B","Betts, I"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1493405,"sim:weight":0.236464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65996,"sim:weight":0.218217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66020,"sim:weight":0.191835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85086,"sim:weight":0.18695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340554,"sim:weight":0.184479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85418,"sim:weight":0.177947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.174696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109121,"sim:weight":0.166379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176859,"sim:weight":0.161657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.161332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.161332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108593,"sim:weight":0.159595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98997,"sim:weight":0.158655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65961,"sim:weight":0.151981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66901,"sim:weight":0.135817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61637,"sim:weight":0.135549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.134742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108243,"sim:weight":0.126105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1398017,"sim:weight":0.122306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108521,"sim:weight":0.118344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In our previous work, a graphic extension of BNF (GEBNF) was proposed to define the abstract syntax of graphic modeling languages. From a GEBNF syntax definition, a first order predicate logic language can be induced so that meta-modeling can be performed formally by specifying a predicate on the domain of syntactically valid models. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical foundation of this meta-modeling approach. We first formally define the semantics of GEBNF syntax definitions as algebras that contain no junk and satisfy constraints derived from GEBNF syntax rules. The semantics of the induced logic is then formally defined by regarding such algebras as models. We then formally prove that well-formed syntax definitions together with syntax morphisms form a category, where syntax morphisms represent the translations between modeling languages. The models (i.e. algebras) in a modeling language and the homomorphisms between them also form a category. Finally, we prove that the functors from GEBNF syntax definitions to the categories of models and to sentences in the induced first order logic form an institution. Therefore, GEBNF and its induced logics form a valid formal specification language for models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhu, H"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8932650,"sim:weight":0.217564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934451,"sim:weight":0.215871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87405,"sim:weight":0.211696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513401,"sim:weight":0.210897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999162,"sim:weight":0.206122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997462,"sim:weight":0.200602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932227,"sim:weight":0.187464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934408,"sim:weight":0.186953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573418,"sim:weight":0.185116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99029,"sim:weight":0.181539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934405,"sim:weight":0.169971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933370,"sim:weight":0.169971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332869,"sim:weight":0.169486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57140,"sim:weight":0.143279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826914,"sim:weight":0.11965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931886,"sim:weight":0.103897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1509268,"sim:weight":0.0849215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":35778,"sim:weight":0.0847953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Hence, it was surprising that Davies and Cuetos (2005) observed a Spanish-speaking aphasic patient, MJ, who showed some capacity to read words aloud - producing many semantic errors -alongside an inability to read nonwords. MJ’s symptoms are congruent with deep dyslexia. We investigated whether her reading could be improved through therapy addressing those deep dyslexic symptoms (de Partz, 1986).--Aims--We expected to see joint improvement in word and nonword reading if therapy aimed at facilitating improvement in nonword reading succeeded, due to the consistency of the orthography. We hypothesized that occurrence of semantic paralexias in reading should decrease as reading skills improved. Alternatively, if therapy had led to the establishment of a lexical-semantic reading strategy not available to the patient before injury then we anticipated the possibility that semantic errors could actually increase in occurrence as more therapy was received over time.--Methods and procedures--Our study began 18 months after MJ’s brain injury, and continued over two years. Training was given in completing spelling-sound mappings at the level of grapheme-phoneme correspondences, syllables and words, in phoneme awareness and the combination of phonemes, and in word-picture association. We tested oral reading with the same word and nonword stimuli at four time points through the period of our investigation. We analyzed accuracy and error types.--Outcomes and results--By the end of our investigation, MJ presented near-normal word reading and greatly improved, though still impaired, nonword reading. Production of semantic errors disappeared. Thus, adding to some previous case studies (Friedman, 1996), our patient’s symptoms evolved from those typical of deep dyslexia to those typical of phonological dyslexia.--Conclusions--\nOur findings show that, even in a language with a transparent orthography, readers can be aided by therapy addressing both lexical and non-lexical reading. The implication is that premorbid reading in a transparent orthography may depend on lexical and non-lexical reading. This conclusion is supported by the superior improvement of word compared to nonword reading, and by the decline in production of semantic paralexias accompanying the improvement in reading performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, R","Cuetos, Fernando","Rodriguez-Ferreiro, Javier"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83622,"sim:weight":0.614893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107452,"sim:weight":0.506846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82441,"sim:weight":0.464275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108924,"sim:weight":0.43055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933572,"sim:weight":0.31389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.31389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.262574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98933,"sim:weight":0.251751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85134,"sim:weight":0.243264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108964,"sim:weight":0.234216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The ability of a structural joint to maintain satisfactory long-term performance, often in severe environments, is an important requirement of a structural adhesive joint, as the joint should be able to support design loads, under service conditions, for the planned life time of the structure. A number of factors determining the durability of structural adhesive joints have been identified and can be grouped in three categories: environment, materials and stresses. The environment is dominated by temperature and moisture. The materials category includes the adherend, the adhesive, and the inter-phase between them both. The last category refers to the stresses to which the bond is subjected during or after exposure to service environment, affecting both longevity and residual strength.

Although less prestigious than an event such as the Olympic Games, Europe\u0027s cities still actively compete for the right to stage a cultural festival with considerable implications for their status and economies. Since its relatively inconspicuous introduction in 1985 as a brief summer event held in Athens (see Table 1), the festival has steadily grown in size, prestige and income generation. In the case of Liverpool, it is anticipated that during 2008 the city will stage more than 350 separate events, which will attract an extra two million visitors and boost the local economy by an estimated £100 million.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gold, J","Gold, M"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108754,"sim:weight":0.295201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67025,"sim:weight":0.280067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10761,"sim:weight":0.263416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.221498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98711,"sim:weight":0.206813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23709,"sim:weight":0.173108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.172682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23774,"sim:weight":0.167453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This small-scale action research study examines the use of a structured selfassessment tool to deepen reflection. Data are drawn from a group of student teachers who kept reflective journals during an initial teacher training programme over one academic year. They used the tool, which provided a framework of questions about their reflective process, to assess and develop their reflective writing. In this article we discuss the effectiveness of the approach and how it promoted deeper reflection. The results indicate that the change seemed to happen through four mechanisms: revisiting reflections, using structure, taking responsibility and metacognition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Samuels, M N","Betts, J"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58825,"sim:weight":0.526054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653925,"sim:weight":0.478809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109088,"sim:weight":0.410748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.359123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98603,"sim:weight":0.336475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.304342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.267602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821113,"sim:weight":0.267391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15247,"sim:weight":0.266306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.264388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.260772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98881,"sim:weight":0.240595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23668,"sim:weight":0.221597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98717,"sim:weight":0.220604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They interact with children in family history, bear authority in histories of women, gender and marriage, use the role to demonstrate virility, and the capacity for household mastery and citizenship in the history of masculinity, and are metaphors in political culture. Yet there is little sustained work on what constituted the key attributes of fatherhood before 1830. This article shows that the ideal father in the period c.1750 to 1830 was tenderly affectionate, sensitized and moved by babies; he provided hugs, material support and a protective guiding hand. Engrossed in his offspring to the exclusion of much else apart from his wife and national duties, he offered his children a moral example and instruction and possessed a deep understanding of his children\u0027s personalities. The genesis of this imagined fatherhood lay in fundamental eighteenth-century concerns about social, class, gender and familial relationships, and national strength. His form and the language used to describe him owed much to the combined forces of the culture of sensibility and of general Christian ideals antedating Evangelical revival.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bailey, J"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.297654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99496,"sim:weight":0.296923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108648,"sim:weight":0.279551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176807,"sim:weight":0.276041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316123,"sim:weight":0.267474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.266857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108669,"sim:weight":0.265629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734374,"sim:weight":0.254548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108355,"sim:weight":0.24855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.244037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930364,"sim:weight":0.218339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.211962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316069,"sim:weight":0.209159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.207467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.206956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176806,"sim:weight":0.205335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108999,"sim:weight":0.203559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.200321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":315976,"sim:weight":0.197669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108988,"sim:weight":0.196958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The qualitative formal study by applying formal specification in SLABS and Scenario Calculus has proven that mature and optimal communities always form and become stable when agents behave based on the collective knowledge of the communities, whereas community formation does not always reach maturity and optimality if agents behave solely based on individual knowledge, and the communities are not always stable even if such a formation is achieved. The quantitative experimental study by simulation has shown that the convergence time of agent communities depends on several parameters of the system in certain complicated patterns, including the number of agents, the number of community organizers, the number of knowledge categories, and the size of the knowledge in each category.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhu, H","Wang, F","Wang, S"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8998147,"sim:weight":0.386028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827052,"sim:weight":0.34547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25806,"sim:weight":0.334682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932184,"sim:weight":0.332599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932030,"sim:weight":0.3211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997844,"sim:weight":0.311155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.30913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14761,"sim:weight":0.283786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86796,"sim:weight":0.280609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66949,"sim:weight":0.261434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931240,"sim:weight":0.251343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70126,"sim:weight":0.250625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933069,"sim:weight":0.247105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446687,"sim:weight":0.242423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.229828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.229008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.199457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While a belief function corresponds to a polytope of probabilities consistent with it, the related interval probability is geometrically represented by a pair of upper and lower simplices. Starting from the interpretation of the pignistic function as the center of mass of the credal set of consistent probabilities, we prove that relative belief of singletons, relative plausibility of singletons and intersection probability can all be described as foci of different pairs of simplices in the region of all probability measures. The formulation of frameworks similar to the Transferable Belief Model for such Bayesian transformations appears then at hand.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cuzzolin, F"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15527,"sim:weight":0.448414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":240751,"sim:weight":0.210396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":239062,"sim:weight":0.203845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9620380,"sim:weight":0.201024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20956,"sim:weight":0.197408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19444,"sim:weight":0.196889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20362,"sim:weight":0.184424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930910,"sim:weight":0.174324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99210,"sim:weight":0.171853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20593,"sim:weight":0.170688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19953,"sim:weight":0.155133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69506,"sim:weight":0.150269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.143305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86312,"sim:weight":0.138872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268953,"sim:weight":0.134007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448009,"sim:weight":0.129422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933882,"sim:weight":0.127318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19892,"sim:weight":0.11968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66122,"sim:weight":0.119457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108126,"sim:weight":0.109405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, stereo reconstruction using global inference algorithms, such as graph cuts, has not been able to incorporate second-order priors because the triple cliques needed to express them yield intractable (nonsubmodular) optimization problems. This paper shows that inference with triple cliques can be effectively performed. Our optimization strategy is a development of recent extensions to \\alpha--expansion, based on the “ QPBO” algorithm. The strategy is to repeatedly merge proposal depth maps using a novel extension of QPBO. Proposal depth maps can come from any source, for example, frontoparallel planes as in \\alpha-expansion, or indeed any existing stereo algorithm, with arbitrary parameter settings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Woodford, O J","Torr, P H","Reid, I D","Fitzgibbon, A W"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":21467,"sim:weight":0.271355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18494,"sim:weight":0.259792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18529,"sim:weight":0.246028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18499,"sim:weight":0.222761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19669,"sim:weight":0.188641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20572,"sim:weight":0.185567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18442,"sim:weight":0.185074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999573,"sim:weight":0.181529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56544,"sim:weight":0.175656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98450,"sim:weight":0.158547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176871,"sim:weight":0.157265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929808,"sim:weight":0.154936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20513,"sim:weight":0.149553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.14485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20023,"sim:weight":0.143181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931174,"sim:weight":0.141791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931792,"sim:weight":0.140996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19892,"sim:weight":0.135771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20956,"sim:weight":0.135052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21797,"sim:weight":0.125434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Depending on their location, some nodes may be better placed than others to offer a relay function and this may lead to early exhaustion of the battery energy of these nodes. To address this problem, this paper investigates the use of a battery capacity threshold to protect overused nodes and maximise the lifetime of the network. The network lifetime is evaluated as a function of the threshold level using a 25 node network model. The results of the model show that if the threshold level is high, this leads to route blockage. Conversely if the threshold is too low then the more heavily used nodes will rapidly exhaust the battery capacity. The optimum threshold level is found to be approximately 30% of the maximum battery capacity, giving an improvement in the network lifetime of about 78%.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khan, D","Ball, P","Childs, G"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5842182,"sim:weight":0.560298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5839399,"sim:weight":0.401484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26670,"sim:weight":0.393019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5842631,"sim:weight":0.366398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5700162,"sim:weight":0.337927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931241,"sim:weight":0.324679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931258,"sim:weight":0.307139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5843813,"sim:weight":0.277368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708349,"sim:weight":0.261343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Results from static stress analysis and experimental testing demonstrated that significant improvements could be achieved. This paper presents results of further work carried out to assess the fatigue performance of reverse-bent joints. Substrates with different yield and plastic deformation characteristics were used and the effects of different overlap lengths on strength were examined. The results of this research show that the improvements obtained under static tests conditions translate to even higher benefits in fatigue.

In contrast, most other young adult smokers felt relatively unaffected by SFL, describing unexpected social benefits. Although there was high compliance, reports of illegal smoking were more frequent among young, ethnic minority smokers, with descriptions of venues involved suggesting they are ethnically distinct and well hidden. Half of respondents reported stopping smoking in their own homes after SFL, but almost all were Somali or Turkish.

The convergence of 802.16 and PON networks can take the mobility feature of wireless communications and the bandwidth advantage of optical networks jointly. Dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) plays an important role in each of these two networks for QoS assurance. In converged 802.16 and PON networks, the integration of the DBA schemes in both networks plays an even more critical role, since bandwidth request/grant mechanisms used in 802.16 and PON are different and the performance of the integrated DBA directly determines the overall system performance. In this paper, we investigate integrated dynamic bandwidth allocation schemes and their signaling overhead. First, this paper starts with discussing the converged network architecture and especially the issues on integrating optical network unit (ONU) and 802.16 base station (BS). Second, it proposes a slotted DBA (S-DBA) scheme and its performance analytic model. The S-DBA scheme takes into account the specific features of the converged network, aiming to reduce signaling overhead caused by cascaded bandwidth requests and grants. The simulation results show that the proposed S-DBA scheme can effectively reduce signaling overhead and increase channel utilization.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ou, S","Yang, K","Chen, H-H"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.19041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5842149,"sim:weight":0.175177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5847623,"sim:weight":0.174347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931965,"sim:weight":0.111646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795328,"sim:weight":0.110374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While alcohol use among older people is well documented, use of illicit drugs continues to be perceived as behaviour of young people and is a\nneglected area of research. This is the first published qualitative research on the experiences of older drug users in the United Kingdom.\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Merseyside, in 2008, with drug users aged 50 and over recruited through drug treatment services. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and analysed thematically. Only health status and health service contact are reported\nhere.\nResults: Nine men and one woman were interviewed (age range: 54 to 61 years); all but one had been using drugs continuously or intermittently for at least 30 years. Interviewees exhibited high levels of physical and mental morbidity; hepatitis C was particularly prevalent. Injecting-related\ndamage to arm veins resulted in interviewees switching to riskier injecting practices. Poor mental health was evident and interviewees described their lives as depressing. The death of drug-using friends was a common theme and social isolation was apparent. Interviewees also described a\ndeterioration of memory. Generic healthcare was not always perceived as optimal, while issues relating to drug specific services were similar to those arising among younger cohorts of drug users, for example, complaints about inadequate doses of prescribed medication.\nConclusion: The concurrent effects of drug use and ageing are not well understood but are thought to exacerbate, or accelerate the onset of, medical conditions which are more prevalent in older age.

Personal care was described in three different contexts—a continuing relationship, a single consultation, and from the practice as a whole. The extent to which a continuing relationship was important for personal care was determined by the reason for consulting, as well as patients\u0027 consulting history and lifestyle.\nConclusions Patients, general practitioners, primary care nurses, and administrative staff hold similar views on the meaning of personal care, despite differences of emphasis reflecting their different roles. Personal care is promoted by but not always dependent on a continuing provider-patient relationship; human communication and individualised care emerged as important in making care personal whatever the context. Most respondents valued relationships in primary care and had clear ideas about when care in the context of a relationship was most valuable.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tarrant, C","Windridge, K","Boulton, M","Baker, R","Freeman, G"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Previous proteomic studies of the endomembrane system have been hindered by contaminating proteins, making it impossible to assign proteins to organelles. Here we have used the localization of organelle proteins by the isotope tagging technique in conjunction with isotope tags for relative and absolute quantitation and 2D liquid chromatography for the simultaneous assignment of proteins to multiple subcellular compartments. With this approach, the density gradient distributions of 689 proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana were determined, enabling confident and simultaneous localization of 527 proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuolar membrane, plasma membrane, or mitochondria and plastids. This parallel analysis of endomembrane components has enabled protein steady-state distributions to be determined. Consequently, genuine organelle residents have been distinguished from contaminating proteins and proteins in transit through the secretory pathway.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dunkley, T P J","Hester, S","Shadforth, I P","Runions, C J","Weimar, T","Hanton, S L","Griffin, J L","Bessant, C","Brandizzi, F","Hawes, C R","Watson, R B","Dupree, P","Lilley, K S"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24400,"sim:weight":0.211987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.19805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929888,"sim:weight":0.184381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584827,"sim:weight":0.179409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.177714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.16175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5842587,"sim:weight":0.141832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.111719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An odds ratio of 1.38 (95% confidence interval: 1.20, 1.58; heterogeneity, 50.5%) was found for the A1A1 + A1A2 versus the A2A2 genotype. Sensitivity analyses suggested lack of ethnic matching as a possible source of heterogeneity; a small, significant association was detected in studies with ethnic-matched controls (odds ratio \u003d 1.26, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.56; heterogeneity, 37%). Significant associations were also found in analyses restricted to studies reporting use of blinding and those with adequate screening of controls for alcohol dependency.

Papers were reviewed where they had included an evaluation, of people with SCI, of the psychometric properties of an outcome measure, which included functional or mobility domains.Information was extracted concerning item generation, ease and intended method of use and scale properties, in particular: reliability, validity and responsiveness. Conclusions were reached concerning the psychometric properties of each instrument. RESULTS:Eight outcome measures were identified (plus adapted versions). Five had originally been developed specifically for evaluating patients with SCI (chiefly reflecting clinicians\u0027 perspectives), the remaining three had not. The psychometric properties of the instruments varied, with some mixed/contradictory evidence likely relating to differing study sample sizes, characteristics and variable quality.

We evaluated the relationship between exposure to alcohol advertising, marketing and portrayal on subsequent drinking behaviour in young people by systematic review of cohort (longitudinal) studies. Methods: studies were identified in October 2006 by searches of electronic databases, with no date restriction, supplemented with hand searches of reference lists of retrieved articles. Cohort studies that evaluated exposure to advertising or marketing or alcohol portrayals and drinking at baseline and assessed drinking behaviour at follow-up in young people were selected and reviewed. Results: seven cohort studies that followed up more than 13,000 young people aged 10 to 26 years old were reviewed. The studies evaluated a range of different alcohol advertisement and marketing exposures including print and broadcast media. Two studies measured the hours of TV and music video viewing. All measured drinking behaviour using a variety of outcome measures. Two studies evaluated drinkers and non-drinkers separately. Baseline non-drinkers were significantly more likely to have become a drinker at follow-up with greater exposure to alcohol advertisements. There was little difference in drinking frequency at follow-up in baseline drinkers. In studies that included drinkers and non-drinkers, increased exposure at baseline led to significant increased risk of drinking at follow-up. The strength of the relationship varied between studies but effect sizes were generally modest. All studies controlled for age and gender, however potential confounding factors adjusted for in analyses varied from study to study. Important risk factors such as peer drinking and parental attitudes and behaviour were not adequately accounted for in some studies. Conclusion: data from prospective cohort studies suggest there is an association between exposure to alcohol advertising or promotional activity and subsequent alcohol consumption in young people. Inferences about the modest effect sizes found are limited by the potential influence of residual or unmeasured confounding.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, L","Foxcroft, D"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1495073,"sim:weight":0.474578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.327123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58210,"sim:weight":0.267305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83480,"sim:weight":0.205824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.185969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.185969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60467,"sim:weight":0.183883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.144114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.141577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108088,"sim:weight":0.0925816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A mixed methods design blending both quantitative and qualitative data was used in the study carried out in two phases over a nine-month period in 2005. Quantitative data were collected through: the SFP 10-14 Parent/Caregiver Survey Questionnaire, the SFP 10-14 Young Persons\u0027 Survey Questionnaire and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Questionnaire data were compared at the beginning of the SFP 10-14 programmes (weeks 1-2) and at the end of the programmes (week 7). In addition, two focus group meetings were held with families who had undertaken the SFP 10-14 programme; and three focus group meetings were conducted with facilitators of SFP 10-14 programmes. Once quantitative and qualitative data had been analysed separately, a synthesis of the main findings from both approaches was then completed. Following the programmes, parents reported significant changes in communication limit setting, emotional management, prosocial behaviour and drugs/alcohol use. Total difficulties scores were also significantly different pre- and post SFP 10-14 programmes. For the young people, communication, and emotional management were improved and their drugs/alcohol use was less. Their total difficulties scores were also significantly different. Qualitative evidence indicated that families who participated in the study found the SFP 10-14 useful in preventing young people\u0027s alcohol and drug use in terms of: learning more about alcohol and drugs, using knowledge and skills to reduce behaviours that might lead to alcohol and drug use and, for young people, dealing with peer pressure that might lead to drug and alcohol use. Parents/caregivers and young people reported that the SFP 10-14 had played a part in improving family functioning through strengthening the family unit. The findings from this exploratory study suggest that the SFP 10-14 may be a useful primary prevention intervention in helping to prevent drug and alcohol misuse in young people.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coombes, L","Allen, D","Marsh, M","Foxcroft, D"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.235593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83505,"sim:weight":0.214202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83254,"sim:weight":0.202346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.179451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26615,"sim:weight":0.147577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Our code is a modern implementation of this method, presented in a modular fashion as a FORTRAN 90 module containing the relevant subroutines. The code is robust, with the novel feature that the algorithm implements an adaptive contour procedure, choosing contours that avoid the violent oscillatory and exponential natures of the integrand and modifying its choice as necessary. In many cases, the subroutines are efficient and provide results of high accuracy.

These challenges and their global import have been outlined in their broadest terms by members of a ‘Los Angeles School’. In this paper we try to develop the detail of some of these challenges in ways that might allow for comparative analysis. We begin by considering three analytical dimensions along which distinctively postsuburban settlements might be identified. These dimensions are not without their limitations but we regard them as a heuristic device around which to centre ongoing comparative research. We then go on to highlight three political contradictions attending postsuburban growth which appear to flow from some of these defining dimensions. To the extent that such postsuburban growth and politics are distinctive, they pose important challenges to established theories of urban politics.

Certainly, the familiar trapping mechanism of a potential well combined with some dissipative processes is not a good candidate for particles like WIMPs which are supposed to be very slippery. However, in each of the Lagrange regions, L4 and L5, of large planets the potential has a maximum which together with the Coriolis force provides an effective trapping mechanism without the need of any kind of friction. This is a purely inertial and gravitational mechanism with no assumptions on other possible interactions. Hence if the density of dark matter is not negligible in this part of the universe, a direct experiment to be considered is the establishment of a satellite in orbit around one of the stable Lagrange points, L4 or L5, of Jupiter.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ciulli, S","Sebu, C"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99177,"sim:weight":0.253856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2311136,"sim:weight":0.217298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5847137,"sim:weight":0.203404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84813,"sim:weight":0.196836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270131,"sim:weight":0.187693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":656257,"sim:weight":0.182318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929386,"sim:weight":0.171176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2309348,"sim:weight":0.158354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98537,"sim:weight":0.158249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176870,"sim:weight":0.152289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176882,"sim:weight":0.147019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86033,"sim:weight":0.143328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25806,"sim:weight":0.142308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.140923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23605,"sim:weight":0.1311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86037,"sim:weight":0.122639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In addition to their application to modular decomposition, reaction correlation coefficients have a number of other interesting properties, including a convenient means for identifying disconnected subnetworks in a system and potential applications to metabolic engineering.\nThe method computes reaction correlation coefficients from an orthonormal basis of the null-space of the stoichiometry matrix. We show that reaction correlation coefficients are uniquely defined, even though the basis of the null-space is not.\nOnce a complete set of reaction correlation coefficients is calculated, a metabolic reaction tree can be determined through the application of standard programming techniques.

Blasphemy laws are used to discipline unruly populations, to emphasize governmental authority and, latterly in the West, to protect the religious beliefs of others. To those accused of it as a crime it has appeared unnecessary, anachronistic and oppressive. Victims of the crime have seen laws as their only protection against individuals seeking to undermine not simply beliefs but wider standards of morality and behaviour within society. These victims of the crime have also used the concept of blasphemy to reassert their own identities around specific moral imperatives. Blasphemy has a history which reaches into issues of conflict, religious belief, freedom of expression, and is bound up with the growth and development of new media.\nThis four-volume edition draws together a wide variety of rare primary sources relating to blasphemy from the Enlightenment through to the modern era.

The reasons are numerous, ranging from its application under the Nazi regime to its post-1945 application in the Scandinavian countries, the recent sterilization of the Roma in the Czech Republic, and China\u0027s birth planning policies.1 Yet it is only in the past two decades that our knowledge about sterilization policies and practices has improved—both in their historical context, and with respect to their practical implementation.2\nAfter the First World War, the prospect of introducing coercive eugenic measures gained acceptance, especially in Northern and Western Europe. Within the economic crises and political instability that characterized the late 1920s, eugenic sterilization attracted considerable attention from both the medical profession and social reformers interested in protecting the nation from alleged biological degeneration and social decline.3 Many of their justifications were then taken over by intellectuals and government officials, and used in support of the biopolitical projects of the 1940s. Supporters of eugenic sterilization maintained that they were rendering the utmost service to society: defending future generations from social and biological degeneration. Whether such authors thought in terms of purifying the nation of “defective genes”, or protecting it from mixing with “racially inferior” elements, there was widespread agreement that sterilization practices were necessary.\nThe extensive acceptance of eugenic sterilization is also reflected in its geographical diffusion: it was as passionately debated in Britain, the United States and Germany as in Brazil, Poland and Romania. Yet, while the Western European, North American and Latin American cases are well researched, little is known about debates in Eastern European countries.4 As Maria Bucur, Kamila Uzarczyk and Magdalena Gawin suggest, the history of eugenics in Eastern Europe has not only been unfairly neglected but has much to offer in terms of understanding the connection between science, political ideals and national contexts.5 This article hopes to enrich this emerging scholarship by concentrating on a hitherto neglected topic: eugenic sterilization in inter-war Romania.\nThe Romanian case meaningfully demonstrates the increasingly intertwined relationship between eugenic sterilization as medical praxis and eugenic sterilization as political discourse geared towards the political engineering of a biologically defined community. This relationship came about as a result of both international and domestic circumstances, including the wide diffusion of eugenic ideas throughout most European countries and the US following the First World War. The practices of sterilization in these countries indicate an overwhelming preoccupation with women\u0027s reproductive rights, combined with concerns about social categories such as criminals and/or medical categories such as the mentally ill. In inter-war Romania, on the other hand, debates on eugenic sterilization were predominantly stimulated by a particular fear of the degeneracy of the Romanian nation. For many supporters of sterilization, the concept of the nation served as a unifying principle linking their preoccupation with hygiene to concepts of eugenics, social progress and economic sustainability. Not to inquire into the debate on sterilization would not only render the history of Romanian eugenics during the inter-war period incomplete but would also leave the relationship between concepts of national health and totalitarian biopolitics unexplored.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turda, M"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.218815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.188822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108067,"sim:weight":0.178726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.176138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316095,"sim:weight":0.173605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.16055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.155293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56993,"sim:weight":0.14571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.137693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109140,"sim:weight":0.133474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recently the historical literature on coroners has been enriched by macro-studies. Despite this important research, the social lives of coroners and their daily interactions remain relatively neglected in standard historical accounts. This article redresses that issue by examining the working life of the coroner for Oxford during the late-Victorian era. Edward Law Hussey kept very detailed records of his time in office as coroner. New research material makes it feasible to trace his professional background, from doctor of the sick poor, to hospital house surgeon and then busy coroner. His career trajectory, personal interactions, and professional disputes, provide an important historical prism illuminating contemporary debates that occupied coroners in their working lives. Hussey tried to improve his medico-legal reach and the public image of his coroner\u0027s office by reducing infanticide rates, converting a public mortuary, and acquiring a proper coroner\u0027s court. His campaigns had limited success because the social scene in which he worked was complicated by the dominance of health and welfare agencies that resented his role as an expanding arm of the Victorian information state.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hurren, E"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316071,"sim:weight":0.473637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225641,"sim:weight":0.258559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.252594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316094,"sim:weight":0.170954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51463,"sim:weight":0.160517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99222,"sim:weight":0.159007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108898,"sim:weight":0.157376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.152527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.15239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316062,"sim:weight":0.141868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108808,"sim:weight":0.131788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.121879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54706,"sim:weight":0.111684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both pauper cadavers and body parts were used to train doctors in human anatomy at a time when student demand always exceeded the economy of supply. An added problem was that the trade in dead bodies was disrupted by a city coroner for Oxford in a bid to improve his professional standing. Disputes about medico-legal authority over the pauper corpse meant that the Anatomy Department failed to convince the local poor in the city center to sell their loved ones\u0027 remains for dissection on a regular basis. Adverse publicity was a constant financial headache for anatomists. Consistently, they had to pay higher prices for cadavers than their competitors did.

The papers collectively point to the fact that although families and communities could be a source of support for women in crisis, they were also the route by which many instances of infanticide were revealed. In addition, the evidence here suggests that the signifi cance of religious cohesiveness to family and community relations may, in some contexts, have encouraged infanticide to occur, due to a pressure to maintain respectability in religiously observant communities. The fact that the crime occurred regardless of the moral climate in each nation suggests that women faced with the reality of bearing a bastard weighed it against the possible consequences of committing infanticide and decided to take the risk. Thus the role of religious belief in the actions of married and unmarried infanticidal women emerges as a unifying contextual theme that is likely to stimulate further research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kilday, A-M","Watson, K"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316062,"sim:weight":0.223647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.219708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.216899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.213936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57213,"sim:weight":0.207402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.20371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108302,"sim:weight":0.20106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58879,"sim:weight":0.197933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.193653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108741,"sim:weight":0.186206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446416,"sim:weight":0.185846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.171291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.168948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.166391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.145081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56993,"sim:weight":0.139177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108250,"sim:weight":0.104698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It has recently been reported that an optimal exercise intensity for fat oxidation (FATmax) exists; we hypothesize that continuous exercise training at this specific intensity can lead to greater improvements in fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity than a eucaloric interval training program.\nMethods: In a counterbalanced, crossover design, eight sedentary, obese, but otherwise healthy male participants performed two 4-wk blocks of endurance training, either at a predetermined intensity eliciting maximal fat oxidation (TPCON) or at 5-min intervals of ± 20% FATmax (TPINT). During the week preceding the exercise training and 48 h after the final exercise bout, an OGTT, V·O2max test, steady-state exercise, and measurements of body composition were undertaken. Diet was controlled the day before all trials (50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein; ~2900 kcal·d-1). Variables were compared using two-way repeated-measures analyses of variance.\nResults: It was shown that fat oxidation rates were increased by 44% after TPCON (0.24 ± 0.01 vs 0.35 ± 0.03 g·min-1, P \u003c 0.05) but not after TPINT, and the whole-body insulin sensitivity index was increased by 27% after TPCON (P \u003c 0.05). These changes occurred despite no change in body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), percent body fat (%BF), or V·O2max.\nConclusions: A continuous exercise training protocol that can elicit high rates of fat oxidation increases the contribution of fat to substrate oxidation during exercise and can significantly increase insulin sensitivity compared with a eucaloric interval protocol.","bibo:AuthorList":["Venables, M","Jeukendrup, A"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98686,"sim:weight":0.429763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81181,"sim:weight":0.412833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91081,"sim:weight":0.338209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496751,"sim:weight":0.315718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385545,"sim:weight":0.299661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26489,"sim:weight":0.274435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.252497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.232277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929822,"sim:weight":0.224739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.224335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.187305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23821,"sim:weight":0.182212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.175008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23873,"sim:weight":0.175008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.145316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Gas exchange measurements and heart rate (HR) recordings were performed throughout exercise. Fat oxidation rates were calculated using stoichiometric equations. Maximal fat oxidation rates were significantly higher during running compared with cycling (0.65 ± 0.05 v 0.47 ± 0.05 g · min−1). However, the intensity, which elicited maximal fat oxidation, was not significantly different between the cycle ergometer and treadmill test (62.1 ± 3.1 v 59.2 ± 2.8% Vo2max, respectively). Fat oxidation rates were significantly higher during the treadmill test compared with the cycle ergometer test from 55 to 80%Vo2max. Maximal oxygen uptake and maximal HR were significantly higher during the treadmill test. It was concluded that fat oxidation rates were higher during walking compared with cycling. Maximal fat oxidation was 28% higher when walking compared with cycling, but the intensity, which elicits maximal fat oxidation, is not different between these 2 exercise modes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Achten, J","Venables, M","Jeukendrup, A"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5844299,"sim:weight":0.269434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81181,"sim:weight":0.25234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385545,"sim:weight":0.228617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848229,"sim:weight":0.187651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91090,"sim:weight":0.181538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86379,"sim:weight":0.179325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.179153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998837,"sim:weight":0.177913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.159678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711556,"sim:weight":0.150965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.14224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.113422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23873,"sim:weight":0.113422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using humans as a particularly tractable model species, we conducted treadmill experiments to test the validity of tri-axial accelerometry loggers, designed for use with animals in the field, to estimate rate of oxygen consumption (VO2: an indirect measure of metabolic rate) and speed during locomotion. The predictive power of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) obtained from loggers attached to different parts of the body was compared to that of heart rate (fH). When subject identity was included in the statistical analysis, ODBA was a good, though slightly poorer, predictor of VO2 and speed during locomotion on the flat (mean of two-part regressions: R2\u003d0.91 and 0.91, from a logger placed on the neck) and VO2 during gradient walking (single regression: R2\u003d0.77 from a logger placed on the upper back) than was fH (R2\u003d0.96, 0.94, 0.86, respectively). For locomotion on the flat, ODBA was still a good predictor when subject identity was replaced by subject mass and height (morphometrics typically obtainable from animals in the field; R2\u003d0.92 and 0.89) and a slightly better overall predictor than fH (R2\u003d0.92 and 0.85). For gradient walking, ODBA predicted VO2 more accurately than before (R2\u003d0.83) and considerably better than did fH (R2\u003d0.77). ODBA and fH combined were the most powerful predictor of VO2 and speed during locomotion. However, ODBA alone appears to be a good predictor and suitable for use in the field in particular, given that accelerometry traces also provide information on the timing, frequency and duration of locomotion events, and also the gait being used.","bibo:AuthorList":["Halsey, L","Shepard, E","Hulston, C","Venables, M","White, C","Jeukendrup, A","Wilson, R"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15552,"sim:weight":0.166392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.164567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.164404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.149178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932895,"sim:weight":0.148258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.147299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386034,"sim:weight":0.145027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86101,"sim:weight":0.144983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.13724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57891,"sim:weight":0.134879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269921,"sim:weight":0.126952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.119685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63694,"sim:weight":0.115289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27306,"sim:weight":0.113892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.110926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23821,"sim:weight":0.101151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25995,"sim:weight":0.0995188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.096568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23873,"sim:weight":0.096568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22837,"sim:weight":0.0914456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It was hypothesised that exercise intensity is of primary importance to the regulation of fat oxidation and that gender, body composition, physical activity level, and training status are secondary and can explain part of the observed interindividual variation. For this purpose, 300 healthy men and women (157 men and 143 women) performed an incremental exercise test to exhaustion on a treadmill [adapted from a previous protocol (Achten J, Venables MC, and Jeukendrup AE. Metabolism 52: 747–752, 2003)]. Substrate oxidation was determined using indirect calorimetry. For each individual, maximal fat oxidation (MFO) and the intensity at which MFO occurred (Fatmax) were determined. On average, MFO was 7.8 ± 0.13 mg·kg fat-free mass (FFM)–1·min–1 and occurred at 48.3 ± 0.9% maximal oxygen uptake (O2 max), equivalent to 61.5 ± 0.6% maximal heart rate. MFO (7.4 ± 0.2 vs. 8.3 ± 0.2 mg·kg·FFM–1·min–1; P \u003c 0.01) and Fatmax (45 ± 1 vs. 52 ± 1% O2 max; P \u003c 0.01) were significantly lower in men compared with women. When corrected for FFM, MFO was predicted by physical activity (self-reported physical activity level), O2 max, and gender (R2 \u003d 0.12) but not with fat mass. Men compared with women had lower rates of fat oxidation and an earlier shift to using carbohydrate as the dominant fuel. Physical activity, O2 max, and gender explained only 12% of the interindividual variation in MFO during exercise, whereas body fatness was not a predictor. The interindividual variation in fat oxidation remains largely unexplained.","bibo:AuthorList":["Venables, M","Achten, J","Jeukendrup, E"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":81181,"sim:weight":0.306359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98686,"sim:weight":0.239074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.228452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23873,"sim:weight":0.228452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385545,"sim:weight":0.213713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.203783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99057,"sim:weight":0.188425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.182743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496751,"sim:weight":0.163454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.143509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1928141,"sim:weight":0.141884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.141545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.132815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Subjects were given each of the three drinks according to a randomization schedule, approximately balanced for first-order carryover effects. At the beginning of each of the three study periods, the volunteers were fitted with an intraoral appliance containing two human enamel blocks. During each study period, volunteers exercised for 75 min·d-1 (5 repetitions of 15 min of exercise, with 5-min rests between exercise repetitions), 5 d·wk-1 for 3 wk. Each day, drink aliquots of 200 mL were consumed during a 5-min period before exercise and after every 15-min bout of exercise, followed by a final 400-mL aliquot ingested over a 10-min period: a total of 1400 mL per study day. Dental erosion was measured as tissue loss from the enamel blocks by profilometry at the end of each study period.\nResults: Water, PCE, and CCE produced 0.138 µm (SD 0.090 µm), 0.138 µm (SD 0.038 µm), and 4.238 µm (SD 3.872 µm) of enamel loss, respectively.

The objective of the present study was to determine GR to a high GI (glucose) and low GI (maltitol) test drink in subjects of different ethnic origin. In a randomized, single-blind crossover trial, 10 whites, 10 South Indians and 10 Chinese subjects consumed either glucose or maltitol test drink containing 50 g of one of the test products on different occasions. Capillary blood glucose samples were taken at 15 and 10 minutes before and 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after consumption of the test drink. The incremental area under the curve of glucose and maltitol were not significantly different between the 3 groups.

Berry polyphenols may influence carbohydrate metabolism and absorption and hence postprandial glycaemia. To date, studies related to polyphenol effects on the glycaemic response have been completed only in liquids using either monosaccharides or disaccharides. It remains to be determined whether berries known to be rich in polyphenols can reduce the glycaemic response (GR) to a solid polysaccharide meal. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether berries alter postprandial hyperglycaemia and consequently the GR to a starchy food. Blood glucose was tested on seven occasions, on three occasions using a reference food and on four occasions using pancakes supplemented with either raspberries or blueberries or control pancakes containing similar amounts of fructose and glucose. Results showed that there were no differences in GR (blueberry 51·3 (sem 5·7); raspberry 54·7 (sem 5·6); blueberry control 43·9 (sem 4·2); raspberry control 41·8 (sem 6·4)), GR area under the curve or satiety index between any of the tests.

Nine healthy subjects were recruited for measuring the glycemic response and GI. Subjects were served portions of the test foods (50 g of available carbohydrates) and a reference food (50 g of glucose) on separate occasions. Capillary blood glucose was measured up to 120 min after consuming the spaghetti. The total glycemic response was calculated geometrically as the incremental areas under the curve (IAUC) using the trapezoid rule. The GI was calculated geometrically by expressing the IAUC for the test food as a percentage of each subject’s average IAUC for the glucose.\nResults\nThe IAUC for spaghetti with and without β-glucan was significantly less compared with glucose. The GG spaghetti had IAUC values similar to the spaghetti without β-glucan concentrate. The BB spaghetti showed IAUC values lower than that of the spaghetti without β-glucan. In particular, the spaghetti with 10% BB had an IAUC 52% lower (P ≤ 0.017) than the spaghetti with β-glucan. The GI values for spaghetti with GG were statistically similar to the control. The GI of BB spaghetti decreased with increasing BB concentrations. In particular, the GI of 10% BB spaghetti was 54% lower (P ≤0.02; GI \u003d 29) than that of the control (GI \u003d 64).\nConclusion\nThe BB concentrate significantly decreases the IAUC and GI of spaghetti at a dose of 10%.

The objective of this study was to confirm these in vitro findings in an in vivo model. We hypothesized that the degree of habitual mastication will influence individuals\u0027 in vivo blood glucose response (glycemic response, or GR) to carbohydrate foods. Eleven participants came in on six nonconsecutive days to the laboratory and evaluated 2 test foods (rice and spaghetti). Their GR was measured for the subsequent 120 minutes. Mastication parameters were determined using surface electrode electromyography. The particle size distribution of individuals\u0027 masticated food was also determined. The intraindividual number of chews per mouthful did not significantly differ for rice and spaghetti (29.9 and 33, respectively), although masticated particle size distribution did (P \u003c .001). Significant correlations between the degree of breakdown during mastication and the GR were observed for rice, but none for spaghetti. Individuals\u0027 peak GR (at 45 minutes) correlated significantly with the particles size distribution of their masticated rice (P \u003d .002), and also with the total incremental area under the curve for the GR (r \u003d −0.72; P \u003d .012) and the incremental area under the curve for the first 45 (r \u003d −0.74; P \u003d .010) and 60 minutes (r \u003d 0.73; P \u003d .010) postconsumption.

Where the ‘match’ between tutor and student expectations is effective, students will find clarity, comprehensible language, clearly structured guidance, and thoughtful, communicative guidance. Where there is a ‘mismatch’ between tutor and student expectations, students perceive these qualities to be absent, and are less clear about what they have to DO.

This chapter presents an overview of learner experience research that is being conducted within the e-learning field, and the aspirations for this growth area. Three trends in learner experience research are identified. First, a shift towards research that is more holistic, including that which examines the impact on their study of the pervasive use of technology in learners’ lives; second, attempts to conceptualise the observed variation in learners’ experience, and third, a more strategic use of learner experience research. Policymakers and managers are watching this field closely and looking for evidence that\ncan help inform decisions they need to make about how best to support learners within their institutions and sectors (Melville, 2009). This chapter explains the role of learner experience work on such decision making, with case studies of institutional transformation selected from members of the Evaluation of Learners’ Experiences of E-learning special interest group (ELESIG).","bibo:AuthorList":["Sharpe, R"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5224603,"sim:weight":0.486025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.392051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.316328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98881,"sim:weight":0.29984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98641,"sim:weight":0.26571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60331,"sim:weight":0.265575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.261648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.245594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Developments in Web 2.0 technology could potentially offer a solution. This paper explores the experience of full‐time undergraduate students using a wiki to support group assessments. The results suggest that student preference for traditional face‐to‐face co‐operative working is a key limiting factor to the effective introduction of on‐line tools. The paper questions whether wikis can enhance the experience of collaborative working in the absence of strategies for developing students’ collaboration skills and without addressing their motivation to use wikis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Witney, D","Smallbone, T"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5846971,"sim:weight":0.596113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.331627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.308942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930635,"sim:weight":0.2792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9867,"sim:weight":0.226641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Of particular interest is the construction of a raft of initiatives heavily reliant on the continued participation of citizens for their functioning; a reliance persistently justified by claims to uncertainty, even ignorance, among political elites. To better understand these initiatives and their implications, this article introduces the concept of stakeholder security to refer to the conscription of ordinary individuals into the state\u0027s security apparatuses; a conscription that positions citizens precariously as simultaneously technologies, subjects and objects of security.

The formin family of actin binding proteins are involved in nucleating MFs in Arabidopsis thaliana. They all contain formin homology domains in the intracellular, C-terminal half of the protein that interacts with MFs. Formins in class I are usually targeted to the plasma membrane and this is true of Formin1 (AtFH1) of A. thaliana. In this study, we have investigated the extracellular domain of AtFH1 and we demonstrate that AtFH1 forms a bridge from the actin cytoskeleton, across the plasma membrane and is anchored within the cell wall. AtFH1 has a large, extracellular domain that is maintained by purifying selection and that contains four conserved regions, one of which is responsible for immobilising the protein. Protein anchoring within the cell wall is reduced in constructs that express truncations of the extracellular domain and in experiments in protoplasts without primary cell walls. The 18 amino acid proline-rich extracellular domain that is responsible for AtFH1 anchoring has homology with cell-wall extensins. We also have shown that anchoring of AtFH1 in the cell wall promotes actin bundling within the cell and that overexpression of AtFH1 has an inhibitory effect on organelle actin-dependant dynamics. Thus, the AtFH1 bridge provides stable anchor points for the actin cytoskeleton and is probably a crucial component of the signalling response and actin-remodelling mechanisms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martinière, A","Gayral, P","Hawes, C","Runions, J"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.201396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24400,"sim:weight":0.163691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26718,"sim:weight":0.13003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.127537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the present study, we compared the effects of objects that either loomed or receded in depth. The results of two experiments showed that whereas both motion types benefited from attentional prioritization, as judged by their search slopes, looming objects elicited shorter response times (RTs). We conclude that both motion types attract attention during search; however, the RT advantage for looming motion seems to reflect a processing enhancement that occurs outside of selection and is conferred on the basis of motion direction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skarratt, P A","Cole, G G","Gellatly, A"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":262354,"sim:weight":0.423632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9135,"sim:weight":0.421017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.248038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98778,"sim:weight":0.16618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98776,"sim:weight":0.164947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85539,"sim:weight":0.151122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.140895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.136543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26675,"sim:weight":0.12807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.125478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98730,"sim:weight":0.119172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98836,"sim:weight":0.116456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26757,"sim:weight":0.094095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This effect was replicated. Further comparisons were made between ERP responses to AV speech in which the visual and auditory components were in or out of synchrony, to test whether the effect is associated with the operation of integration mechanisms, as has been claimed, or occurs because of other factors such as attention.\nMethod: ERPs were recorded from participants presented with recordings of unimodal or AV speech syllables in a detection task.\nResults: Comparisons were made between AO and AV speech and between synchronous and asynchronous AV speech. Synchronous AV speech produced an N1/P2 with lower peak amplitudes than with AO speech, unaccounted for by linear superposition of visually evoked responses onto auditory-evoked responses. Asynchronous AV speech produced no amplitude reduction.\nConclusion: The dependence of N1/P2 amplitude reduction on AV synchrony validates it as an electrophysiological marker of AV integration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pilling, M"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In a control task, binocular depth rendered the direction of cylinder rotation unambiguous to monitor participants\u0027 performance and attention during the experimental task. A particular direction of rotation was perceptually stable, on average, for 33.5 s in participants without psychiatric diagnosis. Euthymic, bipolar participants showed a slightly slower rate of switching between the two percepts (percept duration 42.3 s). Under a parametric analysis of the best-fitting model for individual participants, this difference was statistically significant. However, the variability within groups was high, so this difference in average switch rates was not big enough to serve as a trait marker for bipolar disorder. We also found that low-level visual capacities, such as stereo threshold, influence perceptual switch rates. We suggest that there is no single brain location responsible for perceptual switching in all different ambiguous figures and that perceptual switching is generated by the actions of local cortical circuitry.","bibo:AuthorList":["Parker, A J","Brunskill, E","Scarna, A","Krug, K","Goodwin, G M"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.189968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98778,"sim:weight":0.180163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98622,"sim:weight":0.164379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":267116,"sim:weight":0.157897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98981,"sim:weight":0.149741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.149608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176864,"sim:weight":0.146791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.143361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.136258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.130485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.129412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69994,"sim:weight":0.115544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85539,"sim:weight":0.107799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Clinical considerations concerned with the use of behavioural therapy are also highlighted (eg, the role of behaviour therapy as an adjunct to other treatments, its use with special populations, and how it might be delivered to families).","bibo:AuthorList":["Wiggs, L"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.384485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447650,"sim:weight":0.383465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108088,"sim:weight":0.358283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24685,"sim:weight":0.346484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17905,"sim:weight":0.341041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316186,"sim:weight":0.218395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5846010,"sim:weight":0.217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.210229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.209444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.204514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82102,"sim:weight":0.191397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448025,"sim:weight":0.183334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83154,"sim:weight":0.162764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22750,"sim:weight":0.160026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23467,"sim:weight":0.142847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.130427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269586,"sim:weight":0.123225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The advantage of free gaze has been attributed to the use of ocular proprioception or efference signals for online control. The time course of this process, however, is not established, and it is unclear how far in advance gaze can move and still be used to parameterize subsequent movements. In this experiment, the authors considered the advantage of prescanning targets for both pointing and reaching movements. The authors manipulated the visual information and examined the extent to which prescanning of targets could compensate for a reduction in online visual feedback. In comparison with a conventional reaching/pointing condition, the error in pointing was reduced, the eye-hand lead decreased, and both the hand-closure time and the size of the maximum grip aperture in reaching were modulated when prescanning was allowed. These results indicate that briefly prescanning multiple targets just prior to the movement allows the refinement of subsequent hand movements that yields an improvement in accuracy. This study therefore provides additional evidence that the coordinate information arising from efference or ocular-proprioceptive signals can, for a limited period, be buffered and later used to generate a sequence of movements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilmut, K","Wann, J"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98836,"sim:weight":0.297745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84328,"sim:weight":0.266185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65391,"sim:weight":0.262184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65366,"sim:weight":0.226937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69994,"sim:weight":0.209908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109108,"sim:weight":0.1997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.19795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.195058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98730,"sim:weight":0.193445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.178038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.165479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447921,"sim:weight":0.16056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85300,"sim:weight":0.156305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98631,"sim:weight":0.148884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26082,"sim:weight":0.146849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26675,"sim:weight":0.142817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Improvements to the 2nd edition of the test (M-ABC-2) include an extension of the age range and reduction in the number of age bands as well as revision of tasks. The total test score provides a measure of motor performance, which can be used to help make a diagnosis of DCD. M-ABC-2 also provides 3 sub-scales for Manual Dexterity, Aiming and Catching and Balance but the validity of these conceptually derived sub-scales has not previously been reported.\nAim\nTo examine the factor structure of the M-ABC-2 test across the three age bands (AB): AB1 (3–6-year olds), AB2 (7–10-year olds) and AB3 (11–16-year olds).\nMethod\nData from the 2007 standardisation sample (N \u003d 1172) were used in this study. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and structural equation modelling (LISREL 8.8) were employed to explore the relationship between the tasks within each of the 3 age bands. A model trimming approach was used to arrive at a well fitting model.\nResults\nIn AB1 a complex factor structure emerged providing evidence for an independent general factor, as well as specific factors representing the 3 test components. In AB2 a final model emerged with four correlated factors, an additional distinction being drawn between static and dynamic balance. In addition, a 2nd order general factor explained a considerable amount of variance in each primary factor. In AB3 CFA supported the 3-factor structure of the M-ABC-2, with only modest correlations between each factor.\nConclusions\nThe confirmatory factor analyses undertaken in this study further validate the structural validity of the M-ABC-2 as it has developed over time. Although its tasks are largely associated with the three sub-components within each age band, there was also clear evidence for a change in the factor structure towards differentiation in motor abilities with age.\nResearch highlights\nThe factor analyses undertaken support the structure of the Movement ABC 2 Test. Results suggest a developmental process towards specialization in movement abilities.The results have clinical as well as theoretical significance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schulz, J","Henderson, S E","Sugden, D A","Barnett, A L"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447921,"sim:weight":0.27394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99405,"sim:weight":0.250745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.234426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99037,"sim:weight":0.216114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23601,"sim:weight":0.190696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.164987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26759,"sim:weight":0.150544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.149384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.142258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.139748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.0970709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Research has demonstrated that the decision to rotate the shoulders is body scaled (Warren \u0026 Whang, 1987) and that the visuo-motor system generates a rotation proportional to aperture size (Higuchi, Cinelli, Greig, \u0026 Patla, 2006). The current study considered how shoulder angle and movement speed are tailored to aperture size in nine adults. Aperture sizes were classified into shoulder/aperture ratios (SA ratio), including two for which participants had to rotate (0.9/1.1) and two for which participants could pass freely (1.5/1.7). During the initial approach phase (first 3 s), shoulder rotation and movement speed were invariant across SA ratio. Later in the movement, angle of shoulder rotation and the magnitude and timing of the reduction in speed were proportional to SA ratio. The timing of the reduction in speed was progressively later in the movement as SA ratio increased, suggesting early adjustments of movement, such as the timing of the reduction in speed are tightly tuned to the ratio between aperture size and shoulder width, even when no later body adjustments are needed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilmut, K","Barnett, A L"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.187699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":35502,"sim:weight":0.187668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.18329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85026,"sim:weight":0.178683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.140008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.137105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.131576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.115134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446658,"sim:weight":0.113774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

First, it considers the meaning of religion with particular reference to Nicholson v Grainger PLC and suggests that this may represent a step in the wrong direction in defining ‘belief’. It then looks at cases which have involved religious individuals seeking to manifest religion at work in terms of religious dress. It critically examines the way the concept of proportionality has been used to decide these cases, and suggests that at times courts are stepping beyond their usual boundaries in determining religious issues, with particular reference to comments by the courts on issues such whether particular beliefs are ‘core beliefs’. The third area of discussion is the question of whether discrimination by religious individuals on grounds of sexual orientation should be tolerated. The case law (Ladele v Islington Borough Council) is considered in detail. In conclusion, the article assesses whether a hierarchy is developing between different grounds of discrimination protection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vickers, L"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1445930,"sim:weight":0.371069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.275176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176810,"sim:weight":0.272441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1458972,"sim:weight":0.272271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58704,"sim:weight":0.263502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84868,"sim:weight":0.210756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.199267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86047,"sim:weight":0.186263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.181056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227169,"sim:weight":0.177902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To a large extent the definitions of discrimination are uniform in relation to the different grounds of discrimination. In accordance with the Directive, new Regulations have been introduced in the UK prohibiting discrimination on grounds of religion or belief (the Religion and Belief Regulations) and sexual orientation, and amendments have been made to some aspects of the law governing discrimination on grounds of race, sex and disability. Age discrimination is subject to regulations which came into force in October 2006. One common aspect of these new laws and amendments is that the concept of harassment is specifically defined, instead of being viewed as a form as discrimination.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vickers, L"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Most obviously employees need protection when speaking about immediate threats to health and safety or serious financial malpractice, but they also need protection when participating in debate on matters that are in the public interest. The book suggests that the rights of employees to participate in debate on matters of public interest are vital to a healthy democratic system. The book begins with a study of the philosophical basis for protecting the right to free speech and considers the extent to which that right should survive entry to the workplace. It establishes a principled basis upon which to determine the proper scope of the employee\u0027s right to free speech, taking into account the rights of both employers and employees. The impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the law under article 10 ECHR is assessed, together with the question of when the exercise of free speech by an employee breaches the contract of employment. The book contains a detailed treatment of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, the rules on unfair dismissal, and the special position of employees working in the civil service, local government, and the NHS. Throughout the discussion of these issues, an assessment is made of the extent to which the current law complies with the proposed model for protection of employee speech.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vickers, L"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84868,"sim:weight":0.453592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176810,"sim:weight":0.354254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85632,"sim:weight":0.312864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316057,"sim:weight":0.261213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266688,"sim:weight":0.255312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58704,"sim:weight":0.24079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108067,"sim:weight":0.238551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Data were collected during 115 encounters between May 2006 and January 2008. Individual responses were recorded during the first minute of visual contact. The most common responses were “ignore” for arboreal chimpanzees and “monitor” for terrestrial individuals. Chimpanzees rarely responded with “flight”. Adult males were seen disproportionately often relative to adult females, and accounted for 90% of individual responses recorded for terrestrial animals. Entire encounters were also categorized based on the predominant response of the chimpanzee party to researcher proximity. The most frequent encounter type was “ignore” (36%), followed by “monitor” (21%), “intimidation” (18%) and “stealthy retreat” (18%). “Intimidation” encounters occurred when chimpanzees were contacted in dense forest where visibility was low, provoking intense alarm and agitation. Adult males occasionally acted together to repel researchers through aggressive mobbing and pursuit. Chimpanzee behavior during encounters reflects the familiar yet frequently agonistic relationship between apes and local people at Bulindi. The chimpanzees are not hunted but experience high levels of harassment from villagers. Human-directed aggression by chimpanzees may represent a strategy to accommodate regular disruptions to foraging effort arising from competitive encounters with people both in and outside forest. Average encounter duration and proportion of encounters categorized as “ignore” increased over time, whereas “intimidation” encounters decreased, indicating some habituation occurred during the study. Ecotourism aimed at promoting tolerance of wildlife through local revenue generation is one possible strategy for conserving great apes on public or private land. However, the data imply that habituating chimpanzees for viewing-based ecotourism in heavily human-dominated landscapes, such as Bulindi, is ill-advised since a loss of fear of humans could lead to increased negative interactions with local people.

Movements of the upper and lower lip were recorded during non-verbal movements, single words, syllable sequences, and sentence repetition.

In the subset of 71 children who had an IQ score within normal range, those implanted at or before 42 months had age-appropriate reading both 5 and 7 years post-implant. This was not the case for children implanted after 42 months. Reading progress at the two post-implant assessment intervals were found to be highly related.\nConclusions\nAge at implantation was a significant factor in the development of reading skills in this group. In children implanted below the age of 42 months, reading progress was in line with chronological age, which has not been the case previously with profoundly deaf children. With earlier implantation more common in present groups, and improved technology, there is every reason to be optimistic about the influence of cochlear implantation on the development of reading skills in deaf children","bibo:AuthorList":["Archbold, S","Harris, M","O’Donoghue, G","Nikolopoulos, T","White, A","Lloyd Richmond, H"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The deaf children varied in their language backgrounds and preferred mode of communication. All children were given a range of literacy, cognitive and language-based tasks every 12 months. Deaf and hearing children made similar progress in literacy in the beginning stages of reading development and then their trajectories began to diverge. The longitudinal correlates of beginning reading in the deaf children were earlier vocabulary, letter-sound knowledge, and speechreading. Earlier phonological awareness was not a longitudinal correlate of reading ability once earlier reading levels were controlled. Only letter name knowledge was longitudinally related to spelling ability. Speechreading was also a strong longitudinal correlate of reading and spelling in the hearing children. The findings suggested that deaf and hearing children utilize slightly different reading strategies over the first 2 years of schooling.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kyle, F E","Harris, M"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5846008,"sim:weight":0.550585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99261,"sim:weight":0.507808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83413,"sim:weight":0.428719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85363,"sim:weight":0.416122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107452,"sim:weight":0.370905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83412,"sim:weight":0.344594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82639,"sim:weight":0.322742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82441,"sim:weight":0.313647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82397,"sim:weight":0.295514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108924,"sim:weight":0.268754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Generations of academics and critics have maintained the image of Franz Kafka as a tortured seer whose works defy interpretation. In Excavating Kafka James Hawes reveals the truth that lies beneath the image of a middle-European Nostradamus with a typographically irresistible name. The real Franz Kafka was no angst-ridden paranoid but a well-groomed young man-about-town who frequented brothels, had regular sex with a penniless-but-pretty girl and subscribed to upmarket pornography (published by the very man who published Kafka’s first stories).\nExcavating Kafka debunks a number of key facets of the Kafka-Myth, including the idea that Kafka was the archetypal genius neglected in his lifetime; that he was stuck in a dead-end job and struggling to find time to write; that he was tormented by fear of sex; that he had a uniquely terrible, domineering father who had no understanding of his son’s needs; that his literature is mysterious and opaque; that he constructs fantasy-worlds in which innocent everymen live in fear of mysterious and totalitarian powers-that-be.\nWritten with the panache of a supremely gifted comic writer, Excavating Kafka is an engaging and involving reassessment of a major figure of literary modernism that will be welcomed and enjoyed by students of Kafka and by general readers alike.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hawes, J"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The target item may be indicated by a cue/mask surrounding but not overlapping it. Report of the target is reduced when mask offset trails target offset rather than being simultaneous with it. We report 5 experiments investigating whether OSM can be obtained if the search display is on view for a period of up to 830 ms but cueing of the target location is delayed. The question of interest is whether OSM must reflect the initial response of the visual system to target onset or whether it can arise in other ways, possibly during the transition from a pre-attentive representation of the target item to an attentional representation of it. Our results show that OSM decreases in strength as target duration increases. An explanation is suggested in terms of the object individuation hypothesis (Lleras \u0026 Moore, 2003).","bibo:AuthorList":["Gellatly, A","Pilling, M","Carter, W","Guest, D"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We present new behavioural and neurophysiological evidence for the psychological reality of sound-symbolism. In a categorisation task that captures the processes involved in natural language interpretation, participants were faster to identify novel objects when label–object mappings were sound-symbolic than when they were not. Moreover, early negative EEG-waveforms indicated a sensitivity to sound-symbolic label–object associations (within 200 ms of object presentation), highlighting the non-arbitrary relation between the objects and the labels used to name them. This sensitivity to sound-symbolic label–object associations may reflect a more general process of auditory–visual feature integration where properties of auditory stimuli facilitate a mapping to specific visual features.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kovic, V","Plunkett, K","Westermann, G"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The legacy of colonial rule, including the abortive attempt at a West Indies Federation, resulted not only in a profound mistrust of any form of political union but also established the ideal of island self-government as the centre of the region\u0027s political culture. This is clearly manifest in the institutional structure and governance of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM), which is based on the principles of intergovernmentalism. Notwithstanding some recent changes to that institutional structure, such as the introduction of the Caribbean Court of Justice, Member States remain firmly committed to the pursuit of regional integration through cooperation and association without any transfer of their sovereign decision-making powers. It will be argued, however, that this will not only make it increasingly difficult to achieve the economic objectives of CARICOM, but will also make it increasingly difficult to maintain the fragile sense of regional unity, originally forged in the crucible of colonial rule, in a post-colonial world as new alliances both within and without the region begin to emerge.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Brien, D"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930218,"sim:weight":0.318828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99208,"sim:weight":0.218805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109143,"sim:weight":0.21822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28872,"sim:weight":0.216427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99400,"sim:weight":0.204798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.177822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734370,"sim:weight":0.164471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ,) which has been vested with a compulsory and exclusive jurisdiction to interpret and apply the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, is intended to bridge this implementation gap. This has aroused expectations that the CCJ will play a role similar to that played by the ECJ in promoting legal integration. However, it is important to recognise that the ECJ has functioned within a particular jurisdictional framework and has benefited from the contribution of a diverse range of actors within the wider European legal community. It cannot, therefore, be assumed that the CCJ will be able to replicate the role played by the ECJ. The aim of this article is, accordingly, to review the jurisdictional framework within which the CCJ will function; to explore how this is likely to affect its relationship with the wider legal community within CARICOM; and, finally, to consider how this will impact upon legal integration within the region generally.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Brien, D","Morano-Foadi, S"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1458991,"sim:weight":0.281414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930218,"sim:weight":0.274036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68891,"sim:weight":0.268815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108761,"sim:weight":0.260511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269950,"sim:weight":0.248735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":658869,"sim:weight":0.243114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99175,"sim:weight":0.216992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99092,"sim:weight":0.166753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Eleven categories of information need were identified. There was a predominant focus on breast or prostate cancer, leaving a knowledge gap in relation to other cancers. Few papers moved beyond the diagnosis and initial treatment phase, and most did not distinguish between met and unmet needs. Those that did, indicated that partners/family members are more likely to have unmet needs for information about supportive care than for medical information. The concept of ‘information need’ was generally poorly developed and theorised in the papers.\nConclusion: Establishing the information needs of partners and family members of cancer patients is an important, but as yet neglected, area of research.

However, whether the observed dual-task-related gait changes are systematically related to methodological variations remains unclear and researchers still lack knowledge of what cognitive task to use in different groups for clinical purposes or for research. We systematically reviewed experimental studies that measured gait performance with and without performing concurrent cognitive task. Our results suggest that cognitive tasks that involve internal interfering factors seem to disturb gait performance more than those involving external interfering factors. Meta-analysis results show that the overall effect of different cognitive tasks was prominent in gait speed. In healthy participants, meta-regression analysis suggests strong associations between age and speed reduction under dual-task conditions and between the level of cognitive state and speed reduction under dual-task conditions. Standardizing research methodologies, as well as improving their ecological validity, enables better understanding of dual-task-related gait changes in different populations and improves, in turn, our understanding of neural mechanisms and gait control in general in content.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Yahya, E","Dawes, H","Smith, L","Dennis, A","Howells, K","Cockburn, J"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.176446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.175851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.172686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108964,"sim:weight":0.170382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.154832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":35502,"sim:weight":0.154757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23814,"sim:weight":0.154484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23711,"sim:weight":0.133646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26501,"sim:weight":0.123395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.123042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.103216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.0869855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Almost all women (97%) understood that the purpose of mammographic screening was to allow the early detection of breast cancer. However, 20% believed that a normal mammogram result meant there was definitely no breast cancer present, and only 4% understood that screening has not been proven to save lives in women under the age of 50 years. Women held positive views on mammography but did not appear to be well informed about the potential disadvantages.

We explored consultation and prescribing behaviour for depression and anxiety amongst cancer survivors in British primary health care.\nMethods\nThis study uses data on 26,213 survivors of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer at least 5 years post-diagnosis, matched to four controls without cancer, from the UK General Practice Research Database. We compared consultations for depression and anxiety, and prescribing for anti-depressants and anxiolytics between cancer survivors and controls.\nResults\nMultivariate, matched regression models showed no difference in consulting for depression or anxiety between any cancer survivors and matched controls. However, breast cancer (odds ratio (OR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.22) and prostate cancer survivors (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16–1.47) were more likely to receive a prescription for an antidepressant. Breast cancer survivors (IRR 2.49, 95% CI 1.82–3.42) and prostate cancer survivors (IRR 2.84, 95% CI 1.94–4.17) who died received significantly more antidepressants than controls who died. There were no differences in anxiolytic prescribing for colorectal and prostate cancer survivors compared to controls. However, breast cancer survivors nearing the end of life received a greater number of anxiolytic prescriptions compared to controls (IRR 1.84, 95% CI 1.36–2.49).\nConclusions\nIn this cohort of cancer survivors, there were no differences in consultation behaviour for depression and anxiety compared to controls. However, breast and prostate cancer survivors access more antidepressants, and those nearing the end of life received the highest volume of prescriptions. Breast cancer survivors at the end of life also receive more anxiolytics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khan, N","Ward, A","Rose, P","Watson, E"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":88307,"sim:weight":0.590184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1458981,"sim:weight":0.320721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1486879,"sim:weight":0.265438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99220,"sim:weight":0.209877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.149953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795128,"sim:weight":0.121692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91804,"sim:weight":0.119741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2753332,"sim:weight":0.117991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.114942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.112716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98878,"sim:weight":0.111791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99244,"sim:weight":0.107605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.103469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.103469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99012,"sim:weight":0.0904258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98945,"sim:weight":0.0876265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In order to express these receptors separately in heterologous systems, we have engineered pentameric concatenated (α4)2(β2)3 and (α4)3(β2)2 receptors.\nExperimental approach: α4 and β2 subunits were concatenated by synthetic linkers into pentameric constructs to produce either (α4)2(β2)3 or (α4)3(β2)2 receptors. Using two-electrode voltage-clamp techniques, we examined the ability of the concatenated constructs to produce functional expression in Xenopus oocytes. Functional constructs were further characterized in respect to agonists, competitive antagonists, Ca2+ permeability, sensitivity to modulation by Zn2+ and sensitivity to up-regulation by chaperone protein 14-3-3.\nKey results: We found that pentameric concatamers with a subunit arrangement of β2_α4_β2_α4_β2 or β2_α4_β2_α4_α4 were stable and functional in Xenopus oocytes. By comparison, when α4 and β2 were concatenated with a subunit order of β2_β2_α4_β2_α4 or β2_α4_α4_β2_α4, functional expression in Xenopus oocytes was very low, even though the proteins were synthesized and stable. Both β2_α4_β2_α4_β2 and β2_α4_β2_α4_α4 concatamers recapitulated the ACh concentration response curve, the sensitivity to Zn2+ modulation, Ca2+ permeability and the sensitivity to up-regulation by chaperone protein 14-3-3 of the corresponding non-linked (α4)2(β2)3 and (α4)3(β2)2 receptors respectively. Using these concatamers, we found that most α4β2-preferring compounds studied, including A85380, 5I-A85380, cytisine, epibatidine, TC2559 and dihydro-β-erythroidine, demonstrate stoichiometry-specific potencies and efficacies.\nConclusions and implications: We concluded that the α4β2 nicotinic ACh receptors produced with β2_α4_β2_α4_β2 or β2_α4_β2_α4_α4 pentameric constructs are valid models of non-linked (α4)2(β2)3 and (α4)3(β2)2 receptors respectively.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carbone, A","Moroni, M","Groot-Kormelink, P","Bermudez-Diaz, I"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1513163,"sim:weight":0.103704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.0950758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99159,"sim:weight":0.0943288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98640,"sim:weight":0.0838173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268784,"sim:weight":0.0726192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80825,"sim:weight":0.0707128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80948,"sim:weight":0.0652547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We addressed this issue by examining the effects of DHβE and a range of aromatic Erythrina alkaloids on [3H]cytisine binding and receptor function in conjunction with homology models of the α4β2 nAChR, mutagenesis, and functional assays. The lactone group of DHβE and a hydroxyl group at position C-16 in aromatic Erythrina alkaloids were identified as major determinants of potency, which was decreased when the conserved residue Tyr126 in loop A of the α4 subunit was substituted by alanine. Sensitivity to inhibition was also decreased by substituting the conserved aromatic residues α4Trp182 (loop B), α4Tyr230 (loop C), and β2Trp82 (loop D) and the nonconserved β2Thr84; however, only α4Trp182 was predicted to contact bound antagonist, suggesting α4Tyr230, β2Trp82, and β2Thr84 contribute allosterically to the closed state elicited by bound antagonist. In addition, homology modeling predicted strong ionic interactions between the ammonium center of the Erythrina alkaloids and β2Asp196, leading to the uncapping of loop C. Consistent with this, β2D196A abolished sensitivity to inhibition by DHβE or erysodine but not by epierythratidine, which is not predicted to form ionic bonds with β2Asp196. This residue is not conserved in subunits that comprise nAChRs with low sensitivity to inhibition by DHβE or erysodine, which highlights β2Asp196 as a major determinant of the receptor selectivity of Erythrina alkaloids.","bibo:AuthorList":["Iturriaga-Vasquez, P","Carbone, A","Garcia-Beltran, O","Livingstone, P","Biggin, P","Cassels , B","Wonnacott, S","Zapata-Torres, G","Bermudez-Diaz, I"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The α4 and β2 nAChR subunits assemble into two alternate stoichiometries, (α4)2(β2)3 and (α4)3(β2)2, which differ in their functional properties and sensitivity to chronic exposure to nicotine. Here, we investigated the sensitivity of both receptor stoichiometries to modulation by Zn2+. We show that Zn2+ exerts an inhibitory modulatory effect on (α4)2(β2)3 receptors, whereas it potentiates or inhibits, depending on its concentration, the function of (α4)3(β2)2 receptors. Furthermore, Zn2+ inhibition on (α4)2(β2)3 nAChRs is voltage-dependent, whereas it is not on (α4)3(β2)2 receptors. We used molecular modeling in conjunction with alanine substitution and functional studies to identify two distinct sets of residues that determine these effects and may coordinate Zn2+. Zn2+ inhibition is mediated by a site located on the β2(+)/α4(−) subunit interfaces on both receptor stoichiometries. α4H195 and β2D218 are key determinants of this site. Zn2+ potentiation on (α4)3(β2)2 nAChRs is exerted by a site that resides on the α4(+)/α4(−) of this receptor stoichiometry. α4H195 on the (−) side of the ACh-binding α4 subunit and α4E224 on the (+) side of the non-ACh-binding α4 subunit critically contribute to this site.

The percentage overlap between the lesion and the corticospinal tract was calculated for each patient. Walking performance was determined by measures of 10 m speed, spatiotemporal parameters, percentage recovery of centre of mass (CoM), walking symmetry and 2-min endurance walk prior to and following 4 weeks of treadmill training with PBWS that emphasised normal fast walking. Lesion overlap measures weakly correlated with walking performance measures. Spatiotemporal and performance measures changed in response to training, but spatial symmetry and mechanical energy recovery did not. Walking speed at entry to the study predicted change in response to training of 10 m walk time and swing time asymmetry. Age and lesion overlap did not add to prediction of outcome models. The extent of lesion overlap with the corticospinal tract was not strongly associated with either walking performance or response to gait retraining, despite the correlation of these parameters with upper limb recovery.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dawes, H","Enzinger, C","Johansen-Berg, H","Bogdanovic, M","Guy, C","Collett, H","Izadi, H","Stagg, C","Wade, D","Matthews, P"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.188424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98611,"sim:weight":0.17344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.166125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":35502,"sim:weight":0.166078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.162365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.161037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5847038,"sim:weight":0.157182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.127315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99445,"sim:weight":0.124837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269969,"sim:weight":0.106114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We radio-tracked 6 adult individuals between April and November 2007 in the Analamazaotra Special Reserve. Tree holes were 1-9 m high (median: 7 m), in living trees measuring 26-54 cm in diameter at breast height (median: 32 cm), and could be a limiting resource. Each individual used 4 or 5 tree holes and had high nest fidelity. Animals most often slept socially in mixed-sex groups of 2-6 individuals and occasionally shared a tree hole with white-tailed tree rats (Brachytarsomys albicauda). We identified two sleeping groups: one composed of 2 adult males, 2 adult females and 2 juveniles; one composed of at least 2 adult females and 2 juveniles. Although tree holes were generally group exclusive, some intergroup sleeping was observed. Tree holes could have antipredator and thermoregulatory functions. Further research into sleeping hole availability, nest use and the degree of niche separation or competition between sympatric Cheirogaleidae and other tree hole users (e.g. endemic rodents) is needed to assess better the conservation needs of these species.","bibo:AuthorList":["Biebouw, K","Bearder, S","Nekaris, K"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.173457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269988,"sim:weight":0.15249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.148696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.130665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.130665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108684,"sim:weight":0.125889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59935,"sim:weight":0.123107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108770,"sim:weight":0.122409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108618,"sim:weight":0.11458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108390,"sim:weight":0.113602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99161,"sim:weight":0.108956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.103991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86207,"sim:weight":0.0894437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.0826786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62129,"sim:weight":0.0693491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108766,"sim:weight":0.0668306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15174,"sim:weight":0.0665141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25053,"sim:weight":0.0661976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The methodology draws on in-depth interviews and participant observation of significant actors in the tourism sector. The research findings suggest that understanding the intricate political system and power structure in a society is the key to understanding sustainable tourism policy development, planning and implementation. In the case of North Cyprus, policy development was found to be a product of political influence (referred to as ego-driven politics in the text), specifically the use of public resources as an instrument for political power, retention and that the politicisation of the public sector is the underlying cause of the weakened progress in sustainable tourism development. It is therefore essential to have a clear understanding of political issues, key political actors’ interests and how to mitigate personal interests to facilitate and maintain sustainable tourism development in such small states.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yasarata, M","Altinay, L","Burns, P","Okumus, F"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This hypothesis is tested in two experiments using modifications of the dot mask paradigm developed by Lleras and Moore (2003). Target—mask individuation is manipulated by the presentation of additional display items that influence the linking apparent motion seen between a target and a spatially separated mask (Experiment 1), and by the use of placeholders that maintain the target object’s presence during mask presentation (Experiment 2). Results in both cases are consistent with the updating hypothesis in showing significantly reduced masking when the conditions promoted target—mask individuation. However, in both experiments, some masking was still present under conditions of individuation, an effect we attribute to attentional capture by the mask.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pilling, M","Gellatly, A"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5849485,"sim:weight":0.375073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.263702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85539,"sim:weight":0.185639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98776,"sim:weight":0.173616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84704,"sim:weight":0.166862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98836,"sim:weight":0.157704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86501,"sim:weight":0.152308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85300,"sim:weight":0.141493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98778,"sim:weight":0.138381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98730,"sim:weight":0.137953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98622,"sim:weight":0.127905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99071,"sim:weight":0.123645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.120781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85049,"sim:weight":0.113763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.111556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26757,"sim:weight":0.089547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Addressing the many and rich connections between political and religious dissent in the long eighteenth century, the volume also acknowledges the work of Professor James E.

Contributors also address issues of modernity and the ways in which a \u0027modern\u0027 society can draw its inspiration from both religion and secularity, as well as engaging with the seventeenth-century idea of the synthesis of religion and politics and its evolution into a system in which religion and politics were interdependent but separate.\nOffering a broadly-conceived interpretation of current research from a more comprehensive perspective than is often the case, the historiographical implications of this collection are significant for the development of ideas of the nature of the Enlightenment and for the nature of religion, society and politics in the eighteenth century.

From the Puritan divine and scholar Roger Morrice, active at the beginning of the period, to Dean Shipley who died in the reign of George IV, the individuals chosen chart a shifting world of enlightenment and revolution whilst simultaneously reaffirming the tremendous influence that religion continued to bring to bear.\nFor, whilst religion has long enjoyed a central role in the study of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century British history, scholars of religion in the eighteenth century have often felt compelled to prove their subject\u0027s worth. Sitting uneasily at the juncture between the early modern and modern worlds, the eighteenth century has perhaps provided historians with an all-too-convenient peg on which to hang the origins of a secular society, in which religion takes a back-seat to politics, science and economics. Yet, as this study makes clear, in spite of the undoubted innovations and developments of this period, religion continued to be a prime factor in shaping society and culture.\nBy exploring important connections between religion, politics and identity, and asking broad questions about the character of religion in Britain, the contributions put into context many of the big issues of the day. From the beliefs of the Jacobite rebels, to the notions of liberty and toleration, to the attitudes to the French Wars, the book makes an unambiguous and forceful statement about the centrality of religion to any proper understanding of British public life between the Restoration and the Reform Bill.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gibson, W"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Talbot also repeatedly opposed the idea of a split between High and Low Churchmen, which had its origin in political abuse rather than theological principle. This study of Talbot’s thought suggests that churchmen were able to embrace both High and Low Church principles and thus demands a reconceptualisation of the presumption of exclusivity in the two\nparties.

Excommunicants could not qualify for membership of municipal corporations under the Test and Corporation Acts. Towards the end of Charles II’s reign, as fear of protestant dissent grew, excommunication was, however, used to deny voters the right to exercise their franchise. There was a concerted attempt, encouraged by the king, to ensure the election of a compliant tory parliament through the use of excommunication in elections in borough seats. The attempt, reliant on bishops and spiritual courts, represented the high water mark of the ‘ confessional state ’. Of questionable legality, the exclusion of excommunicants from the right to vote was short-lived. The accession of James II, and his Catholicizing policies, created new alliances between Anglicans and dissenters and eroded the willingness of bishops to use excommunication as an electoral instrument. In 1689, the Toleration Act removed the principal cause of the persecution of dissent. The use of excommunication, nevertheless, represented an important attempt to unite the church and state for electoral reasons.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gibson, W"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108379,"sim:weight":0.221358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108759,"sim:weight":0.208389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385493,"sim:weight":0.198868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108752,"sim:weight":0.195604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914776,"sim:weight":0.193868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108724,"sim:weight":0.188238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394200,"sim:weight":0.187936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108340,"sim:weight":0.181637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108367,"sim:weight":0.181361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108654,"sim:weight":0.170967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108353,"sim:weight":0.170302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29218,"sim:weight":0.168934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.164099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53398,"sim:weight":0.156006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108600,"sim:weight":0.153864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58420,"sim:weight":0.152296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108972,"sim:weight":0.150614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59086,"sim:weight":0.149959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108273,"sim:weight":0.140812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.139332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

By contrast, less attention has been paid to former users’ bodies. The aim of this paper therefore is to focus upon the embodied aspects of recovery from heroin use. To this end, we deploy the notions of bodily ‘dys-appearance’ and ‘habitual action’ as sensitising concepts to undertake an analysis of data generated by 40 qualitative interviews carried out with 21 men and 19 women who are overcoming their addiction to heroin in England. Analytically, we distinguish between using bodies and recovering bodies. In the case of the former, ‘habitual action’ is relatively urgent and routinised; in the case of the latter, however, habitual action is more difficult to maintain because the bodily dys-appearances associated with the transition from heroin use are relatively more multifaceted and unfamiliar. The body techniques associated with embodied reproduction of using and recovering bodies can be pre-cognitive, easily overlooked and yet, embedded as they are in mundane, everyday activities, they constitute a crucial part of the process of recovery from heroin.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pickering, L","Neale, J","Pickering, L"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":10479,"sim:weight":0.297489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.199867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.187394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.185297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.166053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98701,"sim:weight":0.16595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.164097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.161681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.161492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.160816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.146716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.130113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930935,"sim:weight":0.102196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These techniques have been applied to the β-globin locus, revealing a complex pattern of interactions with regions along the chromosome that the gene resides on. However, biochemical and microscopy data on the nature of β-globin interactions with other chromosomes is contradictory. Therefore we developed a novel 4C variant, Complete-genome 3C by vectorette amplification (4Cv), which allows an unbiased and quantitative method to examine chromosomal structure. We have used 4Cv to study the microenvironment of the β-globin locus in mice and show that a significant proportion of the interactions of β-globin are inter-chromosomal. Furthermore, our data show that in the liver, where the gene is active, β-globin is more likely to interact with other chromosomes, compared to the brain where the gene is silent and is more likely to interact with other regions along the same chromosome. Our data suggest that transcriptional activation of the β-globin locus leads to a change in nuclear position relative to the chromosome territory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pink, R","Eskiw, C","Caley, D","Carter, D"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23870,"sim:weight":0.231073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5839013,"sim:weight":0.213948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99410,"sim:weight":0.170783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.149422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26719,"sim:weight":0.143607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.140894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98669,"sim:weight":0.111852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.0992983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In terms of energy stored as body fat, and over a prolonged period, an increase in thermogenesis can have a substantial impact on obesity.\nObjectives: To determine the effect of capsaicin on satiety and diet-induced thermogenesis.\nDesign: Rice and rice plus tabasco sauce was fed to 10 subjects using a two-way cross over design. Height, weight, waist and hip circumference and, body fat content of the subjects were measured together with blood pressure, heart rate, energy expenditure (thermogenesis), and satiety which was measured using visual analogue scale.\nOutcomes: Using the area under the curve of thermogenesis versus time, DIT was greater but not significantly so when the subjects consumed rice+Tabasco sauce (treatment containing capsaicin) rather than rice only. Scores for feeling full/not hungry/having less desire to eat 2.5 h after the meal were significantly higher for rice+tabasco sauce than for rice alone. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly different in subjects eating the diets.\nConclusion: Capsaicin increased DIT and had a significant satiating effect, but because of inter-subject variability measurement of DIT needs to be more highly powered to reach statistical significance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mishra, S","Pratt, M"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.227198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5846842,"sim:weight":0.219541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108641,"sim:weight":0.177773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.175257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23524,"sim:weight":0.136471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.131212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26489,"sim:weight":0.13101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108247,"sim:weight":0.130047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23821,"sim:weight":0.117456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.111776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85180,"sim:weight":0.101973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929904,"sim:weight":0.0926387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22742,"sim:weight":0.0918296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108088,"sim:weight":0.0840875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Methods: Fourteen well-trained cyclists were pair-matched and randomly assigned to HIGH-or LOW-glycogen training groups. Subjects performed nine aerobic training (AT; 90 min at 70% (V) over dotO(2max)) and nine high-intensity interval training sessions (HIT; 8 x 5-min efforts, 1-min recovery) during a 3-wk period. HIGH trained once daily, alternating between AT on day 1 and HIT the following day, whereas LOW trained twice every second day, first performing AT and then, 1 h later, performing HIT. Pretraining and posttraining measures were a resting muscle biopsy, metabolic measures during steady-state cycling, and a time trial. Results: Power output during HIT was 297 +/- 8 W in LOW compared with 323 +/- 9 W in HIGH (P \u003c 0.05); however, time trial performance improved by similar to 10% in both groups (P \u003c 0.05). Fat oxidation during steady-state cycling increased after training in LOW (from 26 +/- 2 to 34 +/- 2 mu mol.kg(-1).min(-1), P \u003c 0.01). Plasma free fatty acid oxidation was similar before and after training in both groups, but muscle-derived triacylglycerol oxidation increased after training in LOW (from 16 +/- 1 to 23 +/- 1 mu mol.kg(-1).min(-1), P \u003c 0.05). Training with low muscle glycogen also increased beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase protein content (P \u003c 0.01). Conclusions: Training with low muscle glycogen reduced training intensity and, in performance, was no more effective than training with high muscle glycogen. However, fat oxidation was increased after training with low muscle glycogen, which may have been due to the enhanced metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hulston, C","Venables, M","Mann, C","Martin, C","Barr, K","Jeukendrup, A"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":385545,"sim:weight":0.332342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98686,"sim:weight":0.325003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.175294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.164725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.160828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.149664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848229,"sim:weight":0.144458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.121364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99085,"sim:weight":0.102611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.0927523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The guiding principle of our approach is context dependence, within and (in contrast to Marr [1982]) between levels of organization. We propose that three mechanisms guide the emergence of representations: competition, cooperation, and chronotopy; which themselves allow for two central processes: proactivity and progressive specialization. We suggest that the main outcome of development is partial representations, distributed across distinct functional circuits. This framework is derived by examining development at the level of single neurons, brain systems, and whole organisms. We use the terms encellment, embrainment, and embodiment to describe the higher-level contextual influences that act at each of these levels of organization. To illustrate these mechanisms in operation we provide case studies in early visual perception, infant habituation, phonological development, and object representations in infancy. Three further case studies are concerned with interactions between levels of explanation: social development, atypical development and within that, developmental dyslexia. We conclude that cognitive development arises from a dynamic, contextual change in embodied neural structures leading to partial representations across multiple brain regions and timescales, in response to proactively specified physical and social environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mareschal, D","Johnson, M H","Sirois, S","Spratling, M","Thomas, M S C","Westermann, G"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The application of neural network models to explanations for linguistic problems is illustrated by reviewing a number of models for different aspects of language development, from speech sound acquisition to the development of syntax. Two main benefits of the connectionist approach are highlighted: implemented models offer a high degree of specificity for a particular theory, and the explicit integration of a learning process into theory building allows for detailed investigation of the effect of the linguistic environment on a child. Issues regarding learnability or the need to assume innate and domain specific knowledge thus become an empirical question that can be answered by evaluating a model\u0027s performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Westermann, G","Ruh, N","Plunkett, K"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Instead, the developing jurisprudence under the Convention has created obligations in relation to both the manifestation of religion through offending, and the treatment of repeat, conscientious offenders. These obligations have the potential to give too much emphasis to the protection of religious conviction over other pressing state interests, in particular the rights and interests of others, and need to be read narrowly.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bakalis, C","Edge, P"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176810,"sim:weight":0.32555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85292,"sim:weight":0.258262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85632,"sim:weight":0.24335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1492883,"sim:weight":0.227513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98951,"sim:weight":0.22679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18142,"sim:weight":0.216917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85570,"sim:weight":0.213465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266688,"sim:weight":0.204979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85919,"sim:weight":0.188172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84868,"sim:weight":0.186593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929884,"sim:weight":0.180179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1458972,"sim:weight":0.175138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227169,"sim:weight":0.168857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.164414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99223,"sim:weight":0.163598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269950,"sim:weight":0.16286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.158541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108926,"sim:weight":0.152075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99235,"sim:weight":0.142085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
