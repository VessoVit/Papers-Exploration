An influential neuropsychological model suggests that these two levels of processing are hierarchically linked, with processing of the global structure occurring within the right hemisphere in advance of local processing within the left. However, the predictions of this model and its anatomical basis have not been tested in neurologically normal individuals. The present study used fMRI and required participants to listen to consecutive pitch sequences while performing a same/different one-back task. Sequences, when different, either preserved (local) or violated (global) the contour of the sequence preceding them. When the activations for the local and global conditions were contrasted directly, additional activation was seen for local processing in right planum temporale and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). The presence of additional activation for local over global processing supports the hierarchical view that the global structure of a pitch sequence acts as a “framework” on which the local detail is subsequently hung. However, the lateralisation of activation seen in the present study, with global processing occurring in left pSTS and local processing occurring bilaterally, differed from that predicted by the neuroanatomical model. A re-examination of the individual lesion data on which the neuroanatomical model is based revealed that the lesion data equally well support the laterality scheme suggested by our data. While the present study supports the hierarchical view of local and global processing, there is an evident need for further research, both in patients and neurologically normal individuals, before an understanding of the functional lateralisation of local and global processing can be considered established.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stewart, Lauren","Overath, Tobias","Warren, Jason D.","Foxton, Jessica M.","Griffiths, Timothy D."],"dc:date":"2008-01-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The experiments involve the manipulation of synthetic sounds to produce systematic changes of stimulus features, such as spectral envelope.\r\n\r\nConventional analyses of normal functional imaging data demonstrate that the analysis of spectral envelope and perceived timbral change involves a network consisting of planum temporale (PT) bilaterally and the right superior temporal sulcus (STS). Further analysis of imaging data using dynamic causal modelling (DCM) and Bayesian model selection was carried out in the right hemisphere areas to determine the effective connectivity between these auditory areas. Specifically, the objective was to determine if the analysis of spectral envelope in the network is done in a serial fashion (that is from HG to PT to STS) or parallel fashion (that is PT and STS receives input from HG simultaneously). Two families of models, serial and parallel (16 in total) that represent different hypotheses about the connectivity between HG, PT and STS were selected. The models within a family differ with respect to the pathway that is modulated by the analysis of spectral envelope. After the models are identified, Bayesian model selection procedure is then used to select the ‘optimal’ model from the specified models. The data strongly support a particular serial model containing modulation of the HG to PT effective connectivity during spectral envelope variation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParallel work in neurological subjects addresses the effect of lesions to different parts of this network. We have recently studied in detail subjects with ‘dystimbria’: an alteration in the perceived quality of auditory objects distinct from pitch or loudness change. The subjects have lesions of the normal network described above with normal perception of pitch strength but abnormal perception of the analysis of spectral envelope change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Griffiths, Timothy D.","Kumar, Sukhbinder","Warren, Jason D.","Stewart, Lauren","Stephan, Klaas Enno","Friston, Karl J."],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

An experiment is reported in which eighteen 4-month-old infants were familiarised to a specific spatial relation within an object, across six different orientations of the object. On subsequent test trials the object was presented to the infants in an entirely novel orientation. Between successive test trials the within-object spatial relation was alternated between novel and familiar.

Associations between sleep and internalizing problems are complex and poorly understood. To better understand these covarying difficulties, genetic and environmental influences were estimated by using a twin design. \r\n\r\nMETHODS. Three hundred 8-year-old twin pairs reported on their anxiety and depression by completing the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders and the Children’s Depression Inventory. Parents reported on their children’s sleep problems by completing the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire.\r\n\r\nRESULTS. Children reported by their parents to have different types of sleep problems self-reported more depression symptoms than those without. The correlation between total sleep-problem score and depression was moderate. That between sleep problems and anxiety was smaller and was not examined further. The association between sleep problems and depression was mainly explained by genes, and there was substantial overlap between the genes influencing sleep problems and those influencing depression. There was smaller influence from environmental factors making family members alike, and environmental factors making family members different decreased the association between sleep problems and depression.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS.A range of sleep difficulties are associated with depression in schoolaged children, and the overall association between the 2 difficulties may be largely influenced by genes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gregory, Alice M.","Rijsdijk, Fruhling V.","Dahl, Ronald E.","McGuffin, Peter","Eley, Thalia C."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.579262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108088,"sim:weight":0.533779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26922,"sim:weight":0.271019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23453,"sim:weight":0.23944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26616,"sim:weight":0.220111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29953,"sim:weight":0.125995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26759,"sim:weight":0.11359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The notion that such deterioration is an important event in cognitive decline is supported by the fact that these functions are associated with similar areas of the frontal cortices of the brain (10), which are especially vulnerable to the effects of aging (4).

We show that this object-based mediation of attention is disrupted when a pointing movement is prepared to the cued part; when a pointing response is prepared to a part of an object, discrimination does not differ between (i) stimuli at locations in the same object but distant to the part where the pointing movement is programmed and (ii) stimuli at locations equidistant from the movement but outside the object (Experiment 2). This remains true even when the pointing movement cannot be performed without first coding the whole object (Experiment 3). Our results indicate that pointing either (i) emphasizes spatial selection at the expense of object-based selection, or (ii) changes the nature of the representations(s) mediating perceptual selection.

However, to date there have been no studies exploring the association between HBP, AS and childhood panic/somatic symptoms. Seventy-nine children aged 8 to 11 years completed a mental tracking paradigm (Psychophysiology 18 (1981) 483) to assess HBP, the Children’s Anxiety Sensitivity Index (J Clin Chil Psychol 20 (1991) 162) and the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (J Am Acad Child Adoles Psych 38 (1999) 1230). Those with good HBP (n \u003d 7, 9%) had significantly higher panic/somatic symptoms (t \u003d -1.71, P \u003c 0.05), and AS (t \u003d -2.16, P \u003c 0.02) than those with poor HBP. There were no effects of age, sex or BMI on HBP. Those with high levels of panic/somatic symptoms were seven times more likely to have good HBP and had AS scores 1 S.D. higher than the remainder of the sample. Multivariate analyses revealed that these two phenotypes had independent associations with high panic/somatic symptoms. These results extend the literature on HBP and panic and suggest that in children, as in adults, increased panic/somatic symptoms are associated with enhanced ability to perceive internal physiological cues, and fear of such sensations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Eley, Thalia C.","Stirling, Lucy","Ehlers, Anke","Gregory, Alice M.","Clark, David M."],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23453,"sim:weight":0.427118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26616,"sim:weight":0.349046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76340,"sim:weight":0.242433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.234083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.225669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.212349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631818,"sim:weight":0.205483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.197353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76113,"sim:weight":0.194985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.18911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222867,"sim:weight":0.187236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.186974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24364,"sim:weight":0.185984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.152609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.14843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.136355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.128365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Conventional analyses of current hand preference, using several indices derived from the Annett scale, mostly failed to replicate previous findings. However, there was a significant tendency for greater use of either hand in highly schizotypal males. Furthermore, a significant association between schizotypy and non-right-handedness was found—again only in males—after correcting for the effects of early switching of hand usage, presumed to be due to cultural pressure against left-handedness in Japanese society.

Results: Sleep problems decreased from age 4 years to mid-adolescence, but there was modest stability of individual differences across this age range (r \u003d 0.29). Regression analyses indicated that sleep problems at age 4 predicted behavioral/emotional problems in mid-adolescence after accounting for child sex, adoptive status, and stability of behavioral/ emotional problems. Finally, the correlation between sleep problems and depression/anxiety increased significantly during this age period from r \u003d 0.39 at age 4 years to r \u003d 0.52 at mid-adolescence.

This paper presents an experiment designed to further investigate the role of spatial representations in the production of the error. The introduction of strong visual cues to spatial location was found to reduce the traditional A-not-B search error.

These findings were much stronger for affective reactions to the experiences than for perceptions of the voices. -- Conclusion: These results provide only partial support for the findings of Peters et al. (1999) on differences in delusional ideation and possible reasons for this are discussed. The findings for religious and psychotic individuals are discussed further in terms of interpretational and coping mechanisms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Martin F.","Griffin, Murray","Vice, Sue"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The present study targeted the posterior aspect of BA37 to see whether a deficit, specific to one of the above types of processing could be induced. Four conditions were investigated: word and nonword reading, colour naming and picture naming. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was delivered over posterior BA37 of the left and right hemispheres (lBA37 and rBA37, respectively) and over the vertex. divisions were significantly slower to name pictures when TMS was given over lBA37 compared to vertex or rBA37. rTMS over lBA37 had no significant effect on word reading, nonword reading or colour naming. The picture naming deficit is suggested to result from a disruption to object recognition processes. This study corroborates the finding from a recent imaging study, that the most posterior part of left hemispheric BA37 has a necessary role in object recognition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stewart, Lauren","Meyer, Bernd-Ulrich","Frith, Uta","Rothwell, John"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443269,"sim:weight":0.503619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85539,"sim:weight":0.376817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.36511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.363964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.355743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.355743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.347712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.346483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.346483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.342301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.342301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.314118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.304095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75275,"sim:weight":0.282437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76845,"sim:weight":0.266603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.260322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65337,"sim:weight":0.254597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733696,"sim:weight":0.249426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.241635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76305,"sim:weight":0.23983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Academics have debated the merits of culturalist interpretations versus instrumentalist ones. In focusing primarily on the causes of the conflict, these accounts fail, or in some cases outright refuse, to look at the actual violence that took place. They overlook the details of particular events and how these events have been lived and understood by both perpetrators and victims. As a result, little attention has been paid to the nature of the violence and the way it was experienced on the ground. The suffering has been neatly removed and events sanitized for an academic audience. In this working paper, I argue that in examinations of violent conflict, the details of that violence - the horrific nature of the killings, the trauma experienced by those involved - are often vital to understanding how people experienced and actualized the violence. The removal of these details can complicate attempts at explanation.

GARP14","bibo:abstract":"Introduction\r\nFor traditional British anthropology the ‘other’ was overseas, to be found and studied in static, bounded fields.\r\nAnthropology’s intellectual agriculture of the ‘field’ is rightly celebrated as being fundamental to the discipline. In recent years though, it has turned into something\r\nof a quagmire, in which anthropologists get stuck (or ‘dwell’) while others move around them. The sea meanwhile, and the movement of those upon it, has been sorely neglected. It has been given no place, theoretical or otherwise, by a discipline that from its beginning travelled\r\nacross the sea’s ‘vast emptiness’ yet in which “The discourse of ethnography (‘being there’) is separated from that of travel (‘getting there’)” (Clifford, 1997: 23). Field-work, at most, has been muddy. Anthropological theory, rooted in the land, has often been constrained by\r\na sedentary bias.\r\n\r\nIn departing from the land I do not wish to go overseas but out to sea, to take travel as part of ethnography and to\r\nuproot the groundedness of being and dwelling and see it instead in terms of fluidity, movement and change. The aim\r\nof this paper, then, is to better understand perceptions of the sea and the movement of seafarers, and to explore the sea’s potential as an idea, metaphor and human practice. In all, to set forth a prolegomena of an anthropology of the sea, an anthropology of “They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters” (Psalm 107).\r\n\r\nIt is unsurprising, I suppose, that anthropology has had so little concern with the sea, yet the sea affects the land\r\nin countless ways. It has been the site of various European ‘discoveries’ and of numerous historical voyages, yet such\r\nvoyages are seen as liminal events between the more interesting aspects of colony and metropole. Britain in particular not only has a maritime climate but a maritime\r\nculture. The sea is condemned as a blank environment, an empty space or void. Yet, to pass over a region so lightly – one that covers the majority of the earth’s surface, that affects countless people’s lives through fishing, tourism, travel or flooding, that mediates global trade, is a battleground of national powers, and has a dominating\r\nrole in global ecology – seems ill-advised. And so I wish to emplace the sea, to create a space for it within the  anthropological domain. Not by ‘grounding’ it, but by conceptualising its very fluidity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Phelan, Jake"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It could be approached in straightforward, if quirky, sociological mode as an exploration of the idea that the literature on post-divorce arrangements and step-families, and especially literature that attends to children’s contact with their non-resident fathers, can be re-read in order to consider the issue of contact via communication technologies (predominantly the telephone but also other forms of communication), a form of parent-child contact not captured in the ways that ‘contact’ is measured in present studies. Of interest in itself, perhaps, this point of entrance opens up onto further questions about the management of human affect, and how rearrangements in lines of affect have reverberations beyond those captured by an Oedipal model, insofar as they are not about contact and severance but are various kinds of displacement for all involved. In particular, I am concerned here with the rearrangement of affect for the fathers as their role becomes dispersed, shared and intermittent, a set of problematics that also includes the various ways in which the very body of the mother is removed or circumvented. On a second level the article speaks to a different literature, in that it is an elaboration of the notion of the network as a dispersed hybrid that entails both human and non-human entities, within which any absolute distinction between human and non-human is to be problematised but, I wish to argue, without losing the specificity of human interaction, that is, the questions of human emotion, human desire and human ethics. This elaboration moves toward a critique of the very ubiquity and endless utility of the network idea through the suggestion that its appeal may conceal moments and movements where more unexpected effects are taking place. Indeed, I suggest that there may be some twists in the familial dynamics of ‘households that no longer hold’, where some selected thoughts from a reading of Deleuze and Guattari, specifically around the notion of ‘becoming’, may lead one to read other stories than that proffered through the master trope of the network, ones that are maybe closer to some of the original impulses behind actor-network theory. And thirdly, the article may be engaged as a reflection on contemporary ways in which familial life is governed in contemporary Britain. The family as both a site of economic arrangements and a site of the arrangement of human affect-sexuality-reproduction, are held together and in tension through forms of contemporary government of the family. Contemporary rationalities of familial morality seek to make its members responsible parents without intervening to the extent that they would seek to make them responsible spouses , seen here in the implication that fathers\u0027 economic responsibilities for children are not co-extensive with their emotional connections to women. As opposed to any other familial figure – such as the pater familias or the mother of Donzelot’s thesis – who may have been the link between family and government, it is through the promotion of the figure of the child that familial life is presently and predominantly governed. It is my contention here that it is through the promise of non-government that a notion of an ethical parent (it is predominantly the non-resident father who is being targeted here) is promoted, whose duties to his children and his nation-state should mean that the former should not need to be dependent upon the latter. Alongside other policies that seek to simultaneously promote familial life and paid work-life through the notion of the ethical citizen, and the attendant judgements of those dependent on welfare state provision (see Rose, 1999), contemporary policies surrounding the household that no longer holds expose the various and contradictory modes by which families are ‘made up’ within contemporary regimes.\" (Excerpt, opening paragraph).","bibo:AuthorList":["Bell, Vikki"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The exhibition traced, inter alia, the development of the aestheticisation of insanity through technologies of knowledge production.  To the modern eye there is nothing especially significant or noteworthy about this monomaniac\u0027��s appearance beyond looking rather miserable and forlorn, but the series of portraits, instigated by Dr Etienne-Jean Georget of the asylum at Ivry, were explicitly attempting to present certain typical features.  In this instance, â��the haunted, sideways glance, asymmetrical sag of the mouth and hollow cheeksâ�� were indicative of his type, the child abductor (Kemp and Wallace, 2000:126).  As the exhibition illustrated, photography soon took the place of painting, and the nineteenth century saw the development of this practice of depicting madness, with Jean-Martin Charcot famously building his career on the production of such representations, establishing his photographic unit at the hospital of the Salpatriere in Paris, and writing and lecturing on the \"��visual iconography of the insane\"��.  In Britain Francis Galton studied photographic portraits of criminals from the Home Office and, arguing that â��natural classesâ�� of individuals appeared, produced his composite photographs that purported to illustrate the typical face of each grouping - one of which were sexual offenders.  In Italy, Cesaire Lombroso combined a reading of evolutionary theory with his studies of the human skull and his use of photographic portraits to present his notorious argument that criminals were atavistic, throwbacks from an earlier period, whose status as such was betrayed by their physiognomy.  Presented here in London 2000 for their historical curiosity, his photographic tables showing the faces of Italian and German criminals were initially presented in 1889 under the title \u0027��the Anthropology of the Criminal\u0027�� with the criminalâ�\u0027s name printed underneath each of the sixty eight portraits.

I argue that the speciﬁcities of ‘the social’ cannot be theorized from within the terms of post-Marxism itself and that Butler and Laclau acknowledge this limitation in their most recent work. I therefore conclude that post-Marxism needs a supplement that I call political sociology.  This is a dangerous supplement in the Derridean sense: a necessary addition that destabilizes the value post-Marxism gives to the distinction between ‘social’ and ‘political’ in which the latter is the privileged term.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nash, Kate"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75990,"sim:weight":0.546076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.523856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443364,"sim:weight":0.467257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.453346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.453346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.435125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.393599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56246,"sim:weight":0.392392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.385545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86055,"sim:weight":0.358177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Poststructuralist feminism is readily positioned in these debates as antagonistic to normative universalism. It is criticized as such: how is injustice to be judged and condemned if contestation and the openness of ungrounded universalism are the only ideals? This paper is a \"sub-philosophical\" enquiry into the normative commitments to equality implicit in poststructuralist feminism and its relationship to \"actually existing\" human rights for women as they have been re-worked by the international feminist movement. It argues that poststructuralist feminism can be used to provide support for one possible understanding of equality encoded in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. It addresses feminist concerns over universal rights as androcentric and ethnocentric, arguing that extending human rights to women is compatible with poststructuralist commitments to anti-essentialism and anti-foundationalism and required by the model of \"deconstructive equality\" implicitly shared by CEDAW and poststructuralist feminism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nash, Kate"],"dc:date":"2002-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5227169,"sim:weight":0.538224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.497997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.441204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.430631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.430125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.343854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.343854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.334697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767344,"sim:weight":0.143555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper will consider neo-Kantian understandings of cosmopolitan citizenship to be realised through human rights in which “hot” national feeling and “cool” cosmopolitanism are implicitly opposed in this way.  I will argue that the dichotomy makes it difficult to see how “warm” cosmopolitanism is actually developing in political communities organised by Western states, in less rationalist ways than is suggested by neo-Kantians and in association with, rather than in opposition to, national feeling.  Human rights are developing in part through humanitarian intervention that is of questionable legitimacy in democratic terms.  It is less likely to be judged “right” (or wrong) according to reasoned normative principles with which cosmopolitanism is associated in neo-Kantianism, and more likely to be consented to on the basis of sentimental “popular cosmopolitanism” that feels right.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nash, Kate"],"dc:date":"2003-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This \u0027subject\u0027��, moreover, is operating not merely within a new institutional space and within new processes but within a new ethical landscape. Thus while the participatory ethos links the Forum\u0027s work to much wider changes in the notion of \u0027democracy\u0027��, the specificities of the Forum\u0027s context - its role as part of the Peace process set against Northern Ireland\u0027s history of conflict - give its work a further particular purpose with a complex temporal dimension. The new landscape is one in which the \u0027�call to Peace\u0027 is foregrounded, initiating a complex relationship to what has been, what \u0027��is\u0027 and what the future potentially holds. Peace, it is argued here, requires a performative call to the future, a call for a new spirit. But this new spirit is one that cannot be simply conjured, marketed and distributed like an easy sentimentality, not least because sentimentality simply ignores the present\u0027s tie to the past. Rather, the pursuit of Peace has to be sought in the messiness of the present, and has therefore to be open to the heterogeneity of \u0027the past\u0027��. Competing injunctions arise from the spirits of the past, urging those in the present to follow divergent paths. Following Derrida\u0027s Spectres of Marx (1994), it is argued that these ghosts cannot be simply banished. As this study of the Civic Forum illustrates, how the Forum positions itself, both institutionally and procedurally, necessarily involves the negotiation of notions of past and future. The successful pursuit of Peace will be dependent upon how those in the present receive the ghosts of the past and how they can allow for their enjoining as a condition of that future\u0027��s very possibility.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bell, Vikki"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.23768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86055,"sim:weight":0.199848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.191509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The article considers the scene of devastation created by a Chechen suicide bomber in Moscow in 2003. Drawing upon a reading of the political theory of Hannah Arendt that ties her to the tradition of thinking the sublime, it suggests that the \u0027aesthetic\u0027 impact of the scene dislocates the witness as well as simultaneously locating her/him in this world, a world in which such things happen. This location is a prompting to consider the world-in-common, the movements of the world, in a parallel sense to that in which the notion of the sublime has been employed to describe how the particular can have the ability to usher forth a feeling that there may be a super-sensible purposiveness to nature. At this prompting, the subject is humiliated and limited, since s/he becomes aware of the impossibility of adequately answering such questions, while \u0027ethically\u0027 her/his task is to nevertheless attempt some articulation of the connections so prompted. The article considers various ways in which that articulation might take place in relation to the Moscow bombing, and argues that these contested articulations constitute the \u0027political\u0027 level prompted in response to a scene of horror whose impact operates on the level of sensibility.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bell, Vikki"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.544333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.543022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108764,"sim:weight":0.460088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316069,"sim:weight":0.452004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.445798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227169,"sim:weight":0.43612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.424815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this context, O\u0027Connor\u0027s admiration for Arendt becomes all the more intriguing (since Arendt\u0027s interpretations of the human condition clashed with Voegelin\u0027s), and allows one to stage a theoretical meeting in order to explore O\u0027Connor\u0027s depiction of the secular in relation to a speculative exploration of how Arendt might have responded to the fiction of O\u0027Connor.

The Anti Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and The Terrorism Act 2000 before it had mainly worked with an image of the ‘foreign threat’; but the impact of these events (like the British shoe-bombers and the suicide bombers in Tel Aviv) was such that this image already altering, was firmly established in the public imagination.   Our ‘own’ ‘home grown’ terrorists are not only those who joined attacks elsewhere, but are prepared to stage attacks on British soil.

Of course, with such complex terms at stake, these reassessments are not all of the same ilk; nevertheless, it is remarkable that one now finds some of the most eminent feminist theorists engaged in explorations that would have been unthinkable fifteen years ago, even though much of the theoretical literature employed is much older than this, as the recent explorations of the work of Henri Bergson in the context of feminist theory testify (Grosz, 2004; 2005). What gives this literature its newness is how it reads now now, and, I would argue, , not least in a context where it is presented as a critique of the concept of performativity as it has come to be understood in feminist and cultural theory formativity theory. This is the intriguing dynamic I wish to explore here. How does this work bear upon feminist theory’s espousal of performativity? How do materiality, creativity and ‘life’ come to be posited as an exposure of performativity’s analytic fallacy? And what is the importance of acknowledging the context – or ‘environment’ – where the debate becomes ‘localized’ or territorialized (for example, within feminist theory)?

The Global Call to Action against Poverty had different names in different countries: ONE in US, ‘Plus d’Excuses!’ in France, Maak Het Waar in the Netherlands and so on. Although, as we shall see, Make Poverty History was very carefully managed as a media campaign, it was also genuinely grassroots insofar as it was led by a coalition of over 500 NGOs which receive their funding from donations and membership.

Yet the individuals who participate in these social groups may not even be aware of the structures that they are creating. Almost certainly, these structures emerge through the application of simple, local interactions. Improvised music is an uncertain activity, characterised by a lack of top-down organisation and busy, local activity between improvisers. Emerging structures may only be perceivable at a (temporal) distance. The development of higher-level musical structure arises from interactions at lower levels, and we propose here that the self-organisation of social animals provides a very suggestive analogy. This paper builds a model of interactivity based on stigmergy, the process by which social insects communicate indirectly by environment modification. The improvisational element of our model arises from the dynamics of a particle swarm. A process called interpretation extracts musical parameters from the aural sound environment, and uses these parameters to place attractors in the environment of the swarm, after which stigmergy can take place. The particle positions are reinterpreted as parameterised audio events. \r\n\r\nThis paper describes this model and two applications, Swarm\r\nMusic and Swarm Granulator.","bibo:AuthorList":["Blackwell, Tim M.","Young, Michael W."],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447105,"sim:weight":0.178874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The story describes the trial of a fascist, accused of having participated in one of the brutal reprisal actions that shook Northern Italy throughout the partisan war. The crime is merely mentioned in passing, however, as the story is told from the perspective of the judge, Onofrio Clerici, whose sympathy for the former fascist regime is made clear form the outset. Within the realms of the judicial system the judge feels completely at ease, confident in the knowledge that the law was written by people like him and, moreover, may be turned in any desired direction. Throughout the proceedings, however, gallows are being constructed in the courtyard, and the judge’s confidence is undermined further by three characters hitherto unknown to the court: a clerk and two guards. The mob at the back of the court room, too, is unusually silent on this day. \"Stupidi e ignoranti, - pensò il giudice Onofrio, - credono che l’imputato sia condannato a morte, perciò han construito una forca.\" And, to teach them a lesson, he proposes that the accused be absolved, a sentence which is unanimously approved by the magistrates of the court. But as the judge signs the acquittal, he inadvertently also signs another document, slipped in by the new clerk. It is his own death sentence, condemning him to die \"come un cane\". Without protest the judge succumbs to this sentence and, following the orders of the two guards, hangs himself on the gallows in the now deserted courtyard.

Hanslick intended to provide a thorough revision of musical aesthetics, a revision which would shift theories away from the poetic realm of the feelings and firmly onto formalist ground. He also (though this effect was perhaps inadvertent) implied that the inner content of music was in some mysterious way spiritual or transcendent since, for Hanslick, purely musical forms were \"filled\" rather than \"empty\". As he went about what he called his \"scientific investigation\" of music, Hanslick not only excluded the emotions from the content of music, he also distanced the equally messy business of musical performance from \"the music itself\". He centrally characterized musical performance as mere \"reproduction\" and at one point assured his readers that \"the performer can deliver only what is already in the composition\".

Improvisation is treated as a classification problem at a high level of musical behaviour which can be measured statistically and train a multilayer perceptron neural network. Network outputs shape a stochastic-based synthesis engine. Mappings are covertly assigned, revisited by both player and machine as a performance develops. As the timing and choice of mapping is unknown, both participants are invited to learn and adapt to a responsive sonic environment which is created afresh on each performance. This offers a novel real-time application of feed-forward neural networks and a challenging, creative technological platform for freely improvised music.","bibo:AuthorList":["Young, Michael W."],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1445668,"sim:weight":0.363988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It draws on different types of evidence – from users, experienced practitioners, local custom and practice, research and other related literature. It addresses both in-patient and community care, and situates the profession and its practices in the context of National Service Frameworks. \r\n \r\nThe document begins with description of Art Psychotherapists’ long-standing history of work with this client population and, in so doing, outlines something of the development of the discipline’s theory and clinical practice. It describes the Guideline’s development, the aims and objectives of the project and the overall scope of the  guideline. The processes of generating evidence through consultation with two expert panels – one comprising Art Psychotherapists experienced in this area of work and another comprising service users – are also described. The identification and critical appraisal of research and other texts relevant to the Guideline’s topic, and the development of evidence weightings appropriate to the discipline, are also explained. \r\n \r\nThe Guideline then moves on to an extensive Evidence Review. This narrative describes the evidence the Guideline  Development Group gleaned from all possible sources -  textual, oral and practical. This includes research-based literature, other academically rigorous and descriptive literature and the opinions of expert practitioners, local practitioners and local expert users. The findings from the review process are described in the narrative and each is assigned to an evidence level. The evidence is reviewed thematically, for example regarding the contexts and settings of Art Psychotherapy practice, the referral process, assessment and clinical approaches. The theory that underpins clinical work is described first, followed by practice itself; the former (theory) derives almost entirely \r\nfrom the literature, but the latter (practice) is  significantly informed by the opinions of our two expert panels and by the custom and practice of Art  psychotherapists at Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust. In so doing, the Guideline addresses some of the gaps in the current Art Psychotherapy literature. \r\n \r\nThe Evidence Review is followed by Recommendations. These distil the findings of the Review into General Principles and specific Recommendations for Art Psychotherapy practice with users who are prone to psychotic states. Each Principle and Recommendation is accompanied by a brief statement that refers to the evidence it has been derived from; like the evidence in the review, it too is assigned to a level. The highest level (1a and 1b) should be afforded the most significance. \r\n \r\nThe document concludes with discussion of the implementation of the guideline and audit criteria.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brooker, Julie","Cullum, Michael","Gilroy, Andrea","McCombe, Brian","Mahony, Jacky","Ringrose, Kate","Russell, Denise","Smart, Louise","Zweigbergk, Britta von","Waldman, Judith"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.356432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75264,"sim:weight":0.344075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98489,"sim:weight":0.343065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.318806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222867,"sim:weight":0.318482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.304022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.303865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.289781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.287556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.28473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.284476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.282367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.282367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56635,"sim:weight":0.279389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.271584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.271584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.271584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.271584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.271584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.271584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The term \u0027cyber studio\u0027 was used by Anna Furse, Artistic Director of Athletes of the Heart, UK, who commissioned this programme to facilitate collaboration across 3 countries by a company of dispersed performers for the purposes of creating a text for her production DON JUAN.WHO?/DON JUAN.KDO? in 2007 with Mladinsko Theatre, Ljubljana, Slovenia.\r\n\r\nThe \u0027Cyber Studio\u0027 assembled by Marko Plahuta was conceived to mimic all the requirements of an ideal theatrical research environment ie a space for live practice, a space to record and store such practice, a space for reflective writing and a facility for collecting research in various media. We also wanted to have a public face during our two year research process, which was our blog. The manual explains basic procedures to create an interactive, multiuser computer environment for collaboration in groups with an emphasis on live performance creation ( though it may be used simply for collective research and/or cyber-performance). It also details main software requirements for setting up such an environment. The purpose of the environment we created was to enable a group of artists scattered around the world to collaborate on a theatrical piece. In our project anonymity was essential in our collaborative online writing process. As was the possibility of storing our live writing sessions for future editing. We found the open source \u0027Upstage\u0027 programme extremely user friendly, and eventually worked more in the dialogue box than the stage, though avatars did assist in our \u0027masquerade\u0027. \r\n\r\nThe Studio provided:\r\n\r\n* Components of collaborative environment:\r\nUpstage - a tool for writing the show/ live improvisation and/or rehearsal\r\n\r\n* Blog - a multiuser blog that worked as a publishing platform for the authors and actors to publish their thoughts, comments, questions and creative material.\r\n\r\n* File repository (wiki) – a multiuser environment to store Word documents, pictures, movies and all material that for various reasons (size, ease of publishing, creative reasons) was not suitable for the blog.","bibo:AuthorList":["Furse, Anna F.

{"identifier":1443344,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Buddhism and Ecology: A Virtue Ethics Approach","bibo:abstract":"Introduction: Whether Buddhism has a compelling ecological dimension or not has been a much discussed question in recent years. I think I should put my cards on the table at the outset and say that I count myself among the sceptics in this respect. I see little evidence that the Buddha or his followers, at least down to modern times, have been greatly concerned with questions of ecology. If anything, there is more evidence of a negative presupposition about the value and status of the natural world in Buddhism. In contrast to Christian teachings, the world was not created by God who, as the book of Genesis tells us (vv.9ff), saw that his creation was \u0027good\u0027, and being good, worthy to be preserved. On the contrary, in Buddhism there seems to be an acceptance, even an expectation that the world will decline. This is thought of as a basic characteristic of the cosmic order: the eventual destruction of the environment is a basic feature of saṃsāra, and exactly what we should expect. Efforts to prevent it may therefore be seen as naive and deluded and contrary to a proper understanding of Dharma, or natural law. Against this background I see no obvious basis on which to address specific ecological questions, such as whether the world is a better place with the black rhino in it than without it. In general, Buddhism seems not to regard the conservation of nature as anything more than a prudential matter, and we are given no explicit reasons as to why we might have have a moral obligation to preserve it. It has to be recognized, furthermore, that the concerns of ecology are essentially modern ones, and the ecological problems we face today such as greenhouses gases and global warming are only intelligible against the background of a scientific understanding of the world. Until Buddhism updates its ancient cosmology it is not clear how it will take part in a dialogue which is conducted in the vocabulary of modern science. Although there are certainly many Buddhists today who have an excellent knowledge of science, it seems to me that the intellectual core of the tradition still conceives of the natural world in pre-modern terms. For the present at least, therefore, I do not see Buddhism as in a position to offer convincing answer to modern ecological problems. I agree with Ian Harris that Buddhism’s ecological credentials are far from being conclusively established, and I also share the view that much recent interest in this area is driven by Westerners pursuing a green agenda. The American Buddhist and writer on ecology Stephanie Kaza herself disarmingly admits ‘At this point it is unclear whether ecological practices are primarily motivated by Buddhist tradition or by American environmentalism.’ Lest this prologue sound unduly negative, let me hasten to add that as we are all aware Buddhism is not a monolithic structure, and some strands or traditions may be more or less resourceful than others in addressing environmental issues. For example, Schmithausen has contrasted what he calls the ‘pro-civilization strand’ with the ‘hermit strand.’ There are also certain underlying features of Buddhist moral teachings that may be conducive to the development of an environmental philosophy. What I wish to do in this paper is to explore one of these by drawing on the Western tradition of virtue ethics and providing an introductory sketch of how it might provide a foundation for ecology in Buddhism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Keown, Damien V."],"dc:date":"2006-08-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, repository development in the visual arts remains undeveloped. In this paper, based on my work on Goldsmiths Research Online in the SHERPA-LEAP project and as a subject librarian for visual cultures, I explore the qualities of research in the visual arts, which affect how we represent it in repositories.\r\n\r\n    What is a visual arts perspective? - Research may be practice-based, documentation may be created specifically for the archive. The research environment extends beyond the university into the art world, the web and media. Visual artists are concerned with representation; context matters. How does the repository act in comparison to other contexts?\r\n\r\n    How do the criteria of the academic research environment i.e. publication, validation, citation, peer review translate into the visual art sector? What constitutes an adequate representation of research? I will show examples of an exhibition, event/performance, lecture, video, installation, database, software and visual work and consider activities such as citation in literature, mimicry and mockery as citation, ephemerality, the online CV, gallery talks, teaching and blogs, with reference specifically to visual and multi-media research practices by researchers from Goldsmiths.\r\n\r\n    Visual arts research produces diverse digital objects, which are often in complex, multimedia formats. What are the technical issues we need to address to enable us to present and preserve these materials? How do the conventions of the repository environment map onto this subject area? How do metadata standards developed in museums and galleries reflect concerns of these different domains? I give examples of the use of generic standards to help with decisions.\r\n\r\n    My conclusion is that work in this area is at an early stage. I advocate a pragmatic approach, backed up with further reflexive research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cooke, Jacqueline"],"dc:date":"2007-11-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443300,"sim:weight":0.279102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This thesis sets out to analyse the tradition and prevalence of “idealising” moments of consequence, judgement and decision and their specific relation to a transcendental-style aesthetics of violence.\r\n\r\nIn this written thesis and in my studio-based work I examine the themes of “naturalised justice” and “decision” as means to achieve autonomy, hinged as they are upon critical, theoretical and cultural representations of, and responses to, the problem of the ubiquity of violence. As such, my thesis also asks how the rhetoric of this apparently mutual or shared conviction of autonomy as aggression, violence or force, produces judgement within culture in general, upon and within the condition of absolute finitude.\r\n\r\nIt is through the empirical examination of my studio practice that I consider the universalising forces of individual authorities using the “worn out metaphors” of the post-tragic hero genre. Here, I create movie poster type images and pop-music style videos in which my appropriation of the powerful propaganda of Hollywood movies lives out the impossibility of exteriority, that is, the difficulty of separating this use of the medium from my being caught up within it. These apparently abstract and generic narratives of agency are the focus of my practice throughout. Through them, I investigate (i) the rhetoric of “violence as decision” as something which undermines its own determinism; (ii) the political force of such rhetoric in relation to the naturalisation of belief, (such as traditional, conventional and assumed agreements in the social); and (iii) the procedures and consequences of performances of the rhetoric of violence practiced in the judgements and convictions of individual subjects.\r\n(Abstract, A.

I argue that Greenberg’s physical, bodily determination of painting (but not its purity) is re-located as a criticality in contemporary practice because of the changes brought about by the simulacrum and the digital.  By utilizing the particularities of ‘painterly’ issues such as materiality, depth and opticality into the virtual, this claim responds to Arthur C. Danto’s ‘end of history’ theories where he argues that artists are no longer bound to the dictates of grand master narratives of art.  For Danto, contemporary art has irrevocably deviated from the narrative discourses which define it such as Greenberg’s.  \r\n\r\nNot satisfied with either postmodern strategies of parody in painting that claim a linear end to the modernist canon, or with recent claims that contemporary painting is beyond postmodernism, I convert Greenberg’s physical determinism using Andrew Benjamin’s notion that contemporary abstract painters, through making, accept and transform the historical/modernist premise of the yet-to-be-resolved object/painting by staging a repetition of abstraction as an event of becoming.\r\n\r\nThis ‘re-styling’ of abstract painting is then examined as an ontological conjoining of Greenberg with Merleau-Ponty’s claim that the painter transforms the relationship between the body and a painting by overlapping the interior sense of self with the world of external objects.  I argue that contemporary painting can offer a philosophical dialogue between the painter’s subjectivity as a mirroring of the painter’s personal style through objective ornamental materiality.  This dialogue is developed through Stephen Perrella’s Hypersurface theory which proposes a non-subjective, deterritorialised, architectural parallel of the digital as a transparent, fluid system of multi-dimensional signs in which the contemporary subject traverses.  Consequently, I suggest, the symbolic virtual changes the body’s sensuous relation to time and space and is central to contemporary painting’s criticality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stubbs, Michael"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101510,"sim:weight":0.65253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44082,"sim:weight":0.604997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051969,"sim:weight":0.575545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.572522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.559106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43543,"sim:weight":0.544074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90726,"sim:weight":0.531728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103367,"sim:weight":0.527267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103368,"sim:weight":0.523896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.521827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154507,"sim:weight":0.510663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734401,"sim:weight":0.508673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.506073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1636448,"sim:weight":0.502379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.491502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710190,"sim:weight":0.480343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":895189,"sim:weight":0.473436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":873402,"sim:weight":0.470617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.46522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109077,"sim:weight":0.464981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I propose a three stage model of image making: 1) planning, 2) absorption or ‘un-thought’, and 3) judging; they are seen together as a spiral process. My primary interest is the second stage, both in my studio practice and in the written thesis. In the studio this can be seen in the conjunction between passages emphasizing energy, for instance passages emphasizing a ‘re-invigoration’ of the figure by means of an investigation into mark making and cartoon elements, and passages emphasizing form and colour.\r\n\r\nIn the written work, by using Lacan’s concept of the gaze as template, then employing ideas such as ‘figure’ and ‘dissimulation’ within the libidinal economy (Lyotard), syncretistic scanning and the ability of the primary processes to learn and develop (Ehrenzweig), and the matrixial gaze (Lichtenberg-Ettinger), I aim to illuminate the ‘un-thought’ stage of image making by means of a consideration of libidinal as well as semiotic processes. By including aspects of schizoanalysis (Deleuze and Guattari), I ‘re-contextualize’ Lacan’s concepts of ‘lack’ and the empty signifier and retain his other ideas relating to his (late) concept of the gaze. Schizoanalysis, in providing an extended concept of the unconscious, aids in re-considering Lacan’s concept of the gaze within the context of the process of image making. \r\n\r\nWorking from this basis I propose a grouping of (existing) ideas that I term the libidinal gaze, brought together for the purpose of reflecting on the un-thought stage in the process of image making. In doing so, I consider both concepts of perception as influenced by the processes and energy of the unconscious, and concepts of the unconscious as reflected through post-Freudian and post-Lacanian psychoanalytic thought.","bibo:AuthorList":["Paxson, Pat"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222960,"sim:weight":0.359739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631730,"sim:weight":0.359739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769041,"sim:weight":0.270266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586343,"sim:weight":0.171748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447922,"sim:weight":0.146613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The affect of digital media and virtual reality on conventional notions of physicality and representation is initiating a radical rethink on how we define and understand body/performance art. The question of how and where we locate the internal and external self, an issue that is crucial for artists who use their bodies, is further emphasised through new technological mediation. This signals the possibility of new thinking about presence and exchange within body/performance art. I am primarily interested in how new technologies facilitate different sorts of exchange between artwork/artist and audience. I contend that when the performing body is immersed in new technologies it’s desires and anxieties are exposed. The intersubjective relation generated between the work and audience – the phenomenological experience of a public performance of self – is consequently revealed as erotic. \r\n\r\nI aim to reconfigure contemporary ideas of performance as dependent on immediate presence (liveness). In the performance of self, as embodied by the artist in performance, the conventional distinction between fixed notions of subject and object is collapsed into an intersubjective dynamic. My analysis of this relation is informed by Merleau-Ponty’s reading of the relationship between the visible and the invisible as a ‘chiasmic intertwining’. Accordingly, rather than proceed from the idea of a split between artists and viewer/s, I examine the intersubjective dynamic as an exchange of flesh.\r\n \r\nI use the term ‘technophenomenological’ to describe the enworlded nature of the relationships between bodies, machines and media. I extend this understanding by drawing on psychoanalytic concepts of incorporation and narcissism, on cinema and media theory and on theories of excess and waste. I endeavour to ‘write through’ my practice, sometimes anecdotally and sometimes intuitively, to evolve a dialogue between my practice and theoretical concerns. (A.

In the written element I query equivalence between mimesis and performativity in Judith Butler\u0027s conception; I consider the tragic and hyperbolic faculties of these, as ways of promoting expansion of context in received convention. My video clips have performance in them and mime destructive regimes in mainstream conventions of visual culture, of sexual identity and of political position, to challange these. They mobilize convention and deviation from it, through ineptitude of performance or my ambiguous relation to the convention that I use. Butler conceives the generative possibility in regulation (prohibition and/or \"law). This is my source for prioritizing failure, and conceiving mimesis a practice of power in modification.\r\n\r\nPhilippe Lacoue-Labarthe is an additional source in my writing, and Luce Irigaray a hovering presence. They are deployed to support my conviction that speculative theory mimes tragic art; Hegelian dialectical philosophy and Freudian psychoanalytic discourse founded in tragic art endow a mutual system of logic and belief that mobilizes rejection of \u0027difference\u0027. In these tragic discourses mimesis links death and desire. As a force in hyperbole and the constitutive site of all discursive and artistic conventions or tropes, mimesis may suspend as much as confirm the very truths it promotes.

The main focus is on television in Britain in the 1950s - something which, at the time, we might have though anthropology had very little to say about. In this regard we would be wrong, as I shall attempt to demonstrate. Specialists of various persuasions were attempting to come to terms with this new domestic technology, indeed, general interest was such that intellectuals who engaged in popular debate were asked to contribute their own views and thoughts on the matter. This paper will look at such an intervention and examine one of the first sustained efforts to study the effects of television in the British context. This study was commissioned by the Sunday Times who invited the anthropologist Geoffrey Gorer to write a series of lengthy articles on the relationship between the English people and television. ... These articles, originally published in 1958, provide a fascinating insight into the concerns and preoccupations of a country faced with the fact of television becoming for the first time a \u0027mass\u0027 phenomenon. They also give us an insight into the mind of Gorer himself.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stanton, Gareth"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It stems from my idea that the bars of the crossword grid represent Adorno\u0027s prison-like Culture Industry. By tracing the cultural politics pervading the relationships between those involved in the production and consumption of crosswords, I show crosswords to provide opportunities for freedom, escape, inspiration, innovation, mediation, subversion and critique, all existing alongside the potential for alienation, colonial domination and even a possible role in contemporary forms of Empire. Rather than presenting crosswords as a challenge to Adorno\u0027s Culture Industry model, I argue that all this potential is entirely compatible with it, so long as the Culture Industry is understood as complex rather than as simply a grim, all-encompassing, impenetrable and alienating social construction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Swift, Olivia"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In policy documents and in the media, debate on the integration of the relationship between parents and children has become the focal point, particularly with regard to how they practice autonomy and authority. The practices of ethnic minorities are compared with those of the ethnic majority, which are used as the standards of normal freedom and independency.  \r\n \r\nHowever, the actual practice of autonomy and authority is taken for granted and seldom made clear. This paper explores what is involved in the process of becoming independent in contemporary Norway.

GARP8","bibo:abstract":"This paper constitutes a response to stereotyped notions of life at the bingo hall, notions which have created barriers of derision, snobbery, patronising fondness, even taboo, between bingo as a socio-cultural fact and mainstream society. Research interviews and observation sessions were carried out in an attempt to question clichés on the basis of accounts of lived experience and personal reflection. The idea that the bingo hall represents, particularly for working-class women, a place of social focus, almost of social refuge, is challenged and assumptions about bingo\u0027s social side critically explored. Rather than upholding the notion that game players have autonomously restructured bingo culture to suit their needs and lifestyles, I argue that other forces, over which players have little or no control, have shaped social life at the bingo hall, namely notions of opportunity, possibility, and safety in a male-dominated, capitalist society. I therefore also discuss the presence of money at the bingo hall, and I speculate upon its impact on socialising there, as well as on the taboos surrounding gambling and competitiveness. The suggestion that bingo might not constitute an entirely positive and socially-affirming experience for some players is explored, and set against those cultural stereotypes which characterise the bingo hall as more a social centre than a place to win money.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mann, Katherine"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The event was curated around the following titles: The Organ Table; The Dissection Table; Preserving Table; Eating Flesh; Flesh Eating; DNA Table; Skin Table; Cutting Table; Sawing and Drilling Table; The Eye Ball Table; The Gut Table; Mummification Table. Experts in flesh, such as surgeons, body builders, butchers, artists and scientists gave talks on flesh from their perspective throughout the duration of the event. A Life Drawing class was also part of the evening, to allow visitors to reacquaint themselves with the human body. The event was filmed and photographed for the Wellcome Trust archives. A catalogue for the event was produced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Conreen, Martin","Laughlin, Z.","Miodownik, M."],"dc:date":"2007-09-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.181246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.160741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734401,"sim:weight":0.158715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443360,"sim:weight":0.145839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.138748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.136543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.136379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930822,"sim:weight":0.131143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.127391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1493569,"sim:weight":0.12588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929930,"sim:weight":0.099382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper reported on research undertaken in conjunction with a funded project for the Centre for Education and Learning Technology at Goldsmiths to evaluate theoretical and practical uses of technology in the curriculum through contextual \u0027shifts\u0027 in site. The paper showed how portable technologies (eg Audio Guides, PDAs, mobile phones) allied to innovative pedagogic methods can enhance learning; extending learning from its traditional sites in school to everyday spaces (shopping arcades, streets, etc). The first section of research showed how altering the format of information delivery by using such things as ATGs, PDAs, can enhance student experience within the spatial paradigm of the university. It demonstrated that if human beings are guided by the need to make and mark, plot and plan, situate and sign significant spaces, then more innovative forms of teaching are required to expose how these spaces work to influence our understanding of the world. The second section showed how we could make shifts in the context of delivery by changing learning spaces to transmute \u0027communication into an original journey\u0027 (De Certeau, 1984: xxi). Here handheld technologies were investigated in spatial contexts to move beyond the standardised fields of educational encounter, thus \u0027�shifting\u0027 us to embrace new public arenas (e.g. high street, shopping centre, arcade) for educational purposes (Benjamin, 2002). These spaces reveal how (and where) the cultures of consumerism that we need to analyse (whether in anthropology, sociology, politics or design) are enacted.

The paper then sets aside the notion of these polar attitudes to consider two impulses in work (research/practice)- the centripetal and the centrifugal (drawing on Bakhtin) and sets out the poetic as a co-efficient that conditions the relationship between the two. A metaphorical image, the Reservoir, is then introduced that allows one to map these forces and organise a (re)search in which the active imagination is foregrounded. The reservoir may be used at various points of a programme of creative practice and for different ends- to generate, to build and to analyse.

It  then explores the epistemological bases of design thinking and  suggests that if design thinking is knowledge it is knowledge-in (as)-  potential (potentia). This is a knowledge built with uncertainties - a  pre-reflective knowing. It then moves to describe a critical thread  that may be drawn through the stretch of design practice, including  its uncertainties, and argues that this criticality is what the design  community needs to appreciate and develop. It finally argues that  academe needs to modify it’s validity criteria to accommodate critical  practice rather than shape practice to fit with current validation  models.

The research project (Capability and Progression in Transition through Assessment for Learning in Design and Technology: CAPITTAL-DT; McLaren et al. 2006) was undertaken in associate primary and secondary school settings in 2 local authorities in Scotland and was funded by the Determined to Succeed division within Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED).  \r\n \r\nThe research undertaken had two drivers.  The first was evidence from within Scotland that both teaching and learning of Design and Technology was identified as weak (e.g. HMIE 2002, Dakers 2005), that of particular concern was the tendency for teachers to focus on making products rather than on thinking skills and creative processes and that assessment as part of learning and teaching was “good or better in only 24% of schools” (HMIE 2004).  The second driver was research that had just been completed for the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) that explored approaches to assessing creativity within Design \u0026 Technology (the Assessing Design Innovation project, Kimbell et al. 2004).  This research utilised an approach to authentic summative assessment that indicated additional potential to contribute to assessment for learning. These two drivers combined to provide both a research need and a research opportunity. \r\n \r\nThe study involved learners from 7 schools.  The participants (n\u003d225) were in Primary 6 (10-11years old), Primary7 (11-12years old) and Secondary 1 (12-13 years old).  Intervention and control research cohorts were created to take a quasi-experimental approach. The research gathered baseline and follow-up data before and after transition (either from Primary 6 to Primary 7, or from Primary 7 to Secondary 1) and, for intervention cohorts, tracked curricula experiences in the intervening 9-month period.  \r\n \r\nThe baseline and follow-up data was gathered through authentic assessment activities adapted and developed from the Assessing Design Innovation project. The dataset was created from: \r\n- a ‘Learner Attitudes Towards Creativity’ questionnaire;  \r\n- an authentic assessment activity structure (Stables \u0026 Kimbell, 2000; Kimbell et al., 2004);   \r\n- a ‘learner evaluation’ questionnaire. \r\n \r\nA range of data was created by the study:  \r\n- quantitative performance data derived from a creativity assessment rubric (Kimbell et al, 2004);  \r\n- quantitative attitudinal and evaluative data;  \r\n- qualitative guided and free response data that was analysed using derived content analysis; \r\n- qualitative data derived from semi-structured interviews with teachers to provide illustrative accounts of the related learning and teaching that had been undertaken between baseline and follow-up data collection. \r\n \r\nThis paper explores the relationship between the approaches used for data gathering, the findings from the data and the insights offered for further approaches to sustainable assessment.  Analysis of the data showed links between the creative performance of learners, their attitudes to creativity, the level of sophistication they demonstrated in self and peer reflection and, most importantly, how these changed over the transition period.  The ability to gather and relate these data was created by the use of the authentic assessment activity as the core stimulus for the data.  This paper will provide an insight into how this was undertaken and explore the potential the approach offers other curriculum areas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stables, Kay","McLaren, Susan","Bain, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2007-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Enhanced pitch discrimination and memory has been found in non-savant individuals with autism who also show superior performance on visual disembedding tasks. These experiments investigate the extent that enhanced disembedding ability will be found within the musical domain in autism.\r\n\r\nMethod: High-functioning children with autism, together with age- and intelligence-matched controls, participated in three experiments testing pitch memory, labelling and chord disembedding.\r\n\r\nResults: The findings from experiment 1 showed enhanced pitch memory and labelling in the autism group. In experiment 2, when subjects were pre-exposed to labelled individual tones, superior chord segmentation was also found. However, in experiment 3, when disembedding performance was less reliant on pitch memory, no group differences emerged and the children with autism, like controls, perceived musical chords holistically.\r\n\r\nConclusion: These findings indicate that pitch memory and labelling is superior in autism and can facilitate performance on musical disembedding tasks. However, when task performance does not rely on long-term pitch memory, autistic children, like controls, succumb to the Gestalt qualities of chords.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heaton, Pam F."],"dc:date":"2003-08-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.573499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.505139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446981,"sim:weight":0.503894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445134,"sim:weight":0.434742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.337704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.333009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.325058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.320417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41098,"sim:weight":0.319847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.317564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.313293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.313293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733696,"sim:weight":0.310072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.309277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6008,"sim:weight":0.30793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6024,"sim:weight":0.30793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.307013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.305902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.305902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631137,"sim:weight":0.30561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Nevertheless, research on the everyday use of mental imagery, for example in autobiographical memory tasks, has suggested that it is only visual images that facilitate memory retrieval (e.g., Williams, Healy, \u0026 Ellis, 1999). If this is the case, individuals born without sight may be forced to rely more on verbal encoding (Goddard \u0026 Pring, 2001). This paper explores the presence and everyday role of nonvisual sensory imagery in 16 individuals with and 16 without sight. Using a cue word paradigm, contrary to previous research, Experiment 1 suggested that for both blind and sighted people, nonvisual imageries have a significant role to play in the generation of autobiographical memories. These results were reinforced by similar findings in Experiment 2, which used the same cue word method to explore the role of visual and nonvisual (auditory) imagery when generating future events. The results refute the claim that “useful” imagery in everyday tasks is exclusively visual.","bibo:AuthorList":["Eardley, A.","Pring, Linda"],"dc:date":"2006-11-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The savant\u0027s performance was compared with that of two control participants, one a departmental secretary and the other a professor of mathematics. The facility with which the savant could master the rules governing the relationships between the series of items suggests that he possessed a flexibility of mental processing transcending his ability of calendar calculation. Furthermore, he could recalibrate previous knowledge to solve new hitherto unpractised tasks. When presented with novel problems, the savant, unlike the mathematician, made no initial errors at all on any of the presented tasks, thereby indicating his fast and spontaneous recognition of new rules and of new relationships between items. It is concluded that a cognitive style of \u0027weak central coherence\u0027 as adopted by autistic savants may protect single representations from being retained in the form of stable enduring wholes, and that such a segmentation strategy may allow for the transformation, reorganization and reconstruction of the relationship between single items of information.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pring, Linda","Hermelin, Beate"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Pring and B Hermelin.

It focuses on users\u0027 experiences of media, with no reference to objective system parameters. More than 600 people completed the ITC-SOPI following an experience with one of a range of noninteractive and interactive media. Exploratory analysis (principal axis factoring) revealed four factors: Sense of Physical Space, Engagement, Ecological Validity, and Negative Effects. Relations between the factors and the consistency of the factor structure with others reported in the literature are discussed. Preliminary analyses described here demonstrate that the ITC-SOPI is reliable and valid, but more rigorous testing of its psychometric properties and applicability to interactive virtual environments is required. Subject to satisfactory confirmatory analyses, the ITC-SOPI will offer researchers using a range of media systems a tool with which to measure four facets of a media experience that are putatively related to presence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lessiter, Jane","Freeman, Jonathan","Davidoff, Jules B.","Keogh, Edmund"],"dc:date":"2001-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1445060,"sim:weight":0.543677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88864,"sim:weight":0.479975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.439971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.394186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.384736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86557,"sim:weight":0.361428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.358882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.34925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.34925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.34925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.34925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.34925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.34925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.34925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.34925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.34925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43103,"sim:weight":0.340744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.339493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45409,"sim:weight":0.337302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767834,"sim:weight":0.323689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To this purpose, we studied multichannel electroencephalograph (EEG) signals from two broad groups (all participants were females): artists (professionally trained in visual arts) and non-artists (without any training in art). To assess the underlying synchronization, which is assumed to be the platform for general cognitive integration between different cortical regions, three measures inspired by nonlinear dynamical system theory were applied as follows: (1) index based on generalized synchronization; (2) index based on mean phase coherence; and (3) index of phase synchrony based on entropy. Results consistent over all three measures were as follows: comparing the tasks to rest, the artists showed significantly stronger short- and long-range delta band synchronization, whereas the non-artists showed enhancement in short-range beta and gamma band\r\nsynchronization primarily in frontal regions; comparing the two groups during the tasks, the artists showed significantly stronger delta band synchronization and alpha band desynchronization than did the non-artists. Strong right hemispheric dominance in terms of synchronization was found in the artists. In artists, the higher synchrony in the low-frequency band is possibly due to the involvement of a more advanced long-term visual art memory and to extensive top-down processing. The results demonstrate that in artists, patterns of functional cooperation between cortical regions during mental creation of drawings were significantly different from those in non-artists.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bhattacharya, Joydeep","Petsche, Hellmuth"],"dc:date":"2005-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":10553,"sim:weight":0.163806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25992,"sim:weight":0.15682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999700,"sim:weight":0.143344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85299,"sim:weight":0.140896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.135904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.128841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.128095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26814,"sim:weight":0.109518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Follow up for an average of 24.8 months after initial allocation was by a blinded independent assessor. Participants were aged 16–65, had sustained severe TBI between 3 months and 20 years previously, and had no other neurological conditions. Of 110 initially allocated, 48 outreach and 46 information participants were successfully followed up. Primary outcome measures (Barthel index (BI) and the brain injury community rehabilitation outcome-39 (BICRO-39)) focused on levels of activity and participation. Secondary measures were the functional independence measure and the functional assessment measure (FIM+FAM) and, in a subgroup of 46 participants, the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Analyses were non-parametric.\r\n\r\nResults: outreach participants were significantly more likely to show gains on the BI and the BICRO-39 total score and self organisation and psychological wellbeing subscales. There were likewise strong trends (p\u003c0.10) for BICRO personal care and mobility, and on the FIM+FAM for personal care and cognitive functions. Differential improvements were not seen for indices of socialising, productive employment, anxiety, or depression. Median changes on individual subscales were small, reflecting the diversity of the clinical population; however, 40% of outreach but only 20% of information participants made a clinically significant improvement of 2+ points on at least one BICRO-39 scale. Time since injury was unrelated to the magnitude of gains.\r\n\r\nConclusions: This is the first RCT of multidisciplinary community rehabilitation after severe TBI, and suggests that even years after injury it can yield benefits which outlive the active treatment period.","bibo:AuthorList":["Powell, Jane H.","Greenwood, R.","Heslin, J."],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.37731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.32577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.324651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.280842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.280842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Related to these understandings are well-worn disciplinary distinctions. Thus vaccines and drug treatments are typically understood as biotechnological. They are seen as the proper preserve of laboratory studies and clinical trials that are charged with the creation of biotechnologies to protect human bodies from HIV infection or reduce damaging effects when infection has occurred. By contrast, innovations in safer-sex campaigns and other forms of behavioural prevention are generally considered the mainstay of the social sciences. Research from these fields is intended to provide insights into the beliefs and practices that might inform policy and programmes aimed at individual behaviours.\r\nInterdisciplinary collaborations generally involve social-science study of human experiences of and responses to biomedical phenomena. Good examples are the studies of adherence to HIV antiretroviral drug treatments and studies of the effect of antiretrovirals on concepts of risk and risk behaviours. In such studies, the innovation is often taken to be separate from the individuals that participate in it.

This article draws on fieldwork in a village in Jharkhand and a brick kiln in West Bengal to argue that migrants do not understand their movement in economic terms alone. Many see the brick kilns as a temporary space of freedom to escape problems back home, explore a new country, gain independence from parents or live out prohibited amorous relationships. It is suggested that Jharkhandi activists and policy-makers’ construction of such migration as a ‘problem’ is as much about their vision of how the new tribal state ought to be as about exploitation. Migration to the kilns is seen by them as a threat to the purity and regulation of the social and sexual tribal citizen. This moralising perspective creates a climate that paradoxically encourages many young people to flee to the brick kilns where they can live ‘freely’. In this way, the new puritanism at home helps to reproduce the conditions for capitalist exploitation and the extraction of surplus value.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shah, Alpa"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84871,"sim:weight":0.508466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108656,"sim:weight":0.507392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.457519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108244,"sim:weight":0.438492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930364,"sim:weight":0.438254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108517,"sim:weight":0.427767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710045,"sim:weight":0.42285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.419273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.412539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85677,"sim:weight":0.410039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48338,"sim:weight":0.405114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794545,"sim:weight":0.400944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108403,"sim:weight":0.400472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.398969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108033,"sim:weight":0.39527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43495,"sim:weight":0.395118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.388304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.38702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.38702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.382688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Whilst the wearing of dress that is visibly identifiable as Islamic is often interpreted as a sign of narrow conservatism or political activism, the biographies of these three women suggest something very different. Their sartorial choices and stylistic innovations are the creative products of cosmopolitan lifestyles and attitudes in which concerns about fashion, religion, politics, and aesthetics are interwoven in interesting ways. The article suggests that a focus on sartorial biography enables a shift away from a whole series of conventional dichotomies: religious/secular, traditional/modern, Eastern/Western, Islam/West, towards a broader understanding of the wide range of experiences and concerns that inform the clothing choices of contemporary British Muslim women.

At that time protocols were developed to place artists/master craftsman in charge of industrial production of ceramics, glass, stained glass, textiles, and carpets — an initiative called ‘art into everyday life’ — that extended through to the 1970s and the ‘Brezhnev Stagnation’. It was a period that also produced a number of elegant modernist buildings. After independence this history and the objects/buildings have been devalued because of their Soviet associations. Working with AB Kilimai, Lentvaris David Mabb has produced three tufted carpets combining images of three buildings Sporto Rumai, Vilnius Kino, and Lietuva Kino and design motifs combining Lithuanian patterns from the era, and patterns derived from the work of William Morris (who, as well as being a designer, founded the first architectural conservation society in Britain): saving them for future generations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mabb, David"],"dc:date":"2006-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2733952,"sim:weight":0.222959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340554,"sim:weight":0.14662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108601,"sim:weight":0.14106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.138176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84937,"sim:weight":0.135005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

My theme arises from an increasing difficulty that I am finding in understanding how individual identities relate to dominant constructions of masculinity and femininity. Christine Skelton and Becky Francis argue that we should not be afraid to name certain behaviours as masculine even when they are performed by girls. After a discussion of the problems of defining both \u0027masculinity\u0027 and \u0027femininity\u0027, and a consideration of the power relations between these terms, I go on to consider the concept of \u0027female masculinity\u0027 (Halberstam).

In this article I examine two constructivist approaches to teachers’ adequacy of subject knowledge within UK research on primary science education. In each case I provide a critique of the assumptions they make about the nature of knowledge and how it develops. I do this from a sociocultural perspective, which views knowledge and learning as necessarily situated within communities of practice. My aim is to assess the implications of this perspective for understanding teachers’ adequacy of subject knowledge.","bibo:AuthorList":["Traianou, Anna"],"dc:date":"2006-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In doing so, it has two main aims. First, it seeks to provide some clarification, critique and suggestions that will assist in the elaboration of this idea and offer possible lines of enquiry for further research. Second, it is argued that whilst studying the work of cultural intermediaries can provide a number of insights, such an approach provides only a partial account of the practices that continue to proliferate in the space between production and consumption. Indeed, in significant ways, a focus on cultural intermediaries reproduces rather than bridges the distance between production and consumption. The paper focuses on three distinct issues.

The early 1980s saw the forging of a strong intellectual opposition movement in Serbia which contested the communist system and rallied around the defence of human and civil rights. By the end of the decade, this movement had become engulfed in the process of national homogenisation around Serbia\u0027s communist leader Slobodan Milosevic and his undemocratic approach to the resolution of the national question. The Belgrade intelligentsia\u0027s choice of nation over democracy and its de facto abdication of its critical role not only prevented it from representing a convincing alternative to Milosevic\u0027s belligerent and ultimately self-destructive policy, but also helped Serbia\u0027s neo-communist regime overcome its legitimacy crisis. This book examines this trajectory, highlighting both the limitations inherent in th early activism of critical intellectuals and their reactions to a context marked by deepening economic and political crisis, the disintegration of the common cultural sphere and the affirmation of other Yugoslav nationalisms. By focusing on three related areas - the revision of history and reassessment of the Titoist system, the opening of the \"Kosovo Question\" and the debates with Slovenian intellectuals - it illustrates the elaboration of a new anti-Yugoslav ideology centred around conspiracy theories and notions of victimisation and \"genocide\", the transformation of dissident politics into a platform for Serbian \"state rights and the search for a programme on reforming the federation according to a narrowly defined Serbian national interest.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dragovic-Soso, Jasna"],"dc:date":"2002-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Dragovic-Soso.

Why is it impossible to imagine, much less write, a work like Michel Foucault\u0027s Discipline and Punish within Asian area studies? The impossibility I am referring to is not of content but of form. It is not just about writing such a text but about having it read as something more than a description; having it read for its theoretical significance more generally. That is to say, it is about the impossibility of writing a work that is principally of a theoretical nature but that is empirically and geographically grounded in Asia rather than in Europe or America. Why is it that, when it comes to Asian area studies, whenever “theory” is invoked, it is invariably understood to mean “applied theory” and assumed to be of value only insofar as it helps tell the story of the “real” in a more compelling way?\r\n\r\nTo some extent, what follows is an attempt to explain historically how Western area studies on Asia came to appreciate theory in this limited and limiting way. At the same time, as I began to investigate the history and prehistory of this diaphanous field, I began to recognize the possibilities of a very different form of area studies that could have emerged had different sets of pressures pushed it in a slightly different direction. This essay is therefore an attempt to recuperate these now forgotten possibilities and to build on them in order to produce a different way of seeing, writing, and theorizing Asian area studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dutton, Michael"],"dc:date":"2002-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

On one side, antisemitism appears as a pressing contemporary problem, intimately connected to an intensification of hostility to Israel. Opposing accounts downplay the fact of antisemitism and tend to treat the charge as an instrumental attempt to de-legitimize criticism of Israel. I address the central relationship both conceptually and through a number of empirical case studies which lie in the disputed territory between criticism and demonization. The paper focuses on current debates in the British public sphere and in particular on the campaign to boycott Israeli academia. Sociologically the paper seeks to develop a cosmopolitan framework to confront the methodological nationalism of both Zionism and anti-Zionism. It does not assume that exaggerated hostility to Israel is caused by underlying antisemitism but it explores the possibility that antisemitism may be an effect even of some antiracist forms of anti-Zionism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hirsh, David"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":7548,"sim:weight":0.701558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":490282,"sim:weight":0.651223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99819,"sim:weight":0.62596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108852,"sim:weight":0.59908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2729970,"sim:weight":0.595478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":584610,"sim:weight":0.588146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109116,"sim:weight":0.568654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7470,"sim:weight":0.562508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":584612,"sim:weight":0.545209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":846965,"sim:weight":0.53999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381915,"sim:weight":0.497878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.49374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2785771,"sim:weight":0.491338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187599,"sim:weight":0.486631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5081701,"sim:weight":0.480722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":462982,"sim:weight":0.473977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86060,"sim:weight":0.471192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108817,"sim:weight":0.468518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445000,"sim:weight":0.466131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9427333,"sim:weight":0.464561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Different methods enabled the display of dissimilar relationships to television: reflexive telling, immanent positioning and affective responses all gave distinct variations of moral authority. Therefore, understanding the form as well as the content of our participants\u0027 responses is crucial to interpreting our data.

The gap between these two positions of object/no object is vast. Yet the perception of objects/subjects and their recognition through citation is central to the achievement of feminism within academia and this is where the struggle continues, as this paper shows. By showing how feminism has impacted upon sociology in a variety of ways: institutionally, theoretically, methodologically, politically, practically, it unearths how many different struggles on many different fronts continue. Rather than accepting the defeat or dilution of feminism this paper shows how feminism has inscribed some of the darkest and deepest recesses of sociology.

The paper focuses directly on the ideas of the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben concerning infancy and experience, voice and speech, and bare life and politics. In doing so, an argument is made that\r\nquestions Agamben’s recourse to a particular form of linguistic model and makes evident the limitations that such a model poses for an understanding of significant transformations in modern forms of sovereignty regarding the socio-political articulation of highly domesticated voices. The paper intends to provide some sociological and social theoretical ground for a consideration of the voice of infancy in contemporary forms of biopolitical sovereignty. In doing so, the paper suggests that infancy is more than a figuration of experimentation, inasmuch as its voice (hovering between babble and the comprehensible) may resonate across an empirical domain, which is reconfigured through such a voice (or voices) heard, taken seriously and touching others.","bibo:AuthorList":["Oswell, David"],"dc:date":"2009-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

An important aspect of non-verbal expression is that people respond to each other\u0027s behavior and are highly attuned to picking up this type of response. This is particularly important for the feedback given while listening to some one speak. However, automatically generating this type of behavior is difficult as it is highly complex and subtle. This paper takes a data driven approach to generating interactive social behavior. Listening behavior is motion captured, together with the audio being listened to. This data is used to learn an animation model of the responses of one person to the other. This allows us to create characters that respond in real-time during a conversation with a real human.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gillies, Marco","Pan, Xueni","Slater, Mel","Shawe-Taylor, John"],"dc:date":"2008-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The starting point of this research – edrama – is a 2D graphical environment in which users are represented by static cartoon figures. An application has been developed to enable integration of the existing edrama tool with several new components to support avatars with emotionally expressive behaviours, rendered in a 3D environment. The functionality includes the extraction of affect from open-ended improvisational text. The results of the affective analysis are then used to: (a) control an automated improvisational AI actor – EMMA (emotion, metaphor and affect) that operates a bit-part character in the improvisation; (b) drive the animations of avatars using the Demeanour framework in the user interface so that they react bodily in ways that are consistent with the affect that they are expressing. Finally, we describe user trials that demonstrate that the changes made improve the quality of social interaction and users’ sense of presence.

They are starting to take the place of actors in films and television and are now an integral part of most computer games. Perhaps most interestingly in on-line games and chat rooms they are representing the user visually in the form of avatars, becoming our on-line identities, our embodiments in a virtual world. Currently online environments such as “Second Life” are being taken up by people who would not traditionally have considered playing games before, largely due to a greater emphasis on social interaction. These environments require avatars that are more expressive and that can make on-line social interactions seem more like face-to-face conversations.\r\nComputer animated characters come in many different forms. Film characters require a substantial amount of off-line animator effort to achieve high levels of quality; these techniques are not suitable for real time applications and are not the focus of this chapter. Non-player characters (typically the bad guys) in games use limited artificial intelligence to react autonomously to events in real time. However avatars are completely controlled by their users, reacting to events solely through user commands. This chapter will discuss the distinction between fully autonomous characters and completely controlled avatars and how the current differentiation may no longer be useful, given that avatar technology may need to include more autonomy to live up to the demands of mass appeal. We will firstly discuss the two categories and present reasons to combine them. We will then describe previous work in this area and finally present our own framework for semi-autonomous avatars.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marco, Gillies","Daniel , Ballin","Pan, Xueni","Dodgson, Neil","Cañamero, Lola","Aylett, Ruth"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Nicholas Pevsner’s Academies of Art\r\nPast and Present (CUP 1940) is the starting point of this research, a text which has proven of continual importance for enquiries into art education. Immediately relevant are feminist art history, (Nochlin 1973, Parker \u0026 Pollock 1983), and a number of American academics’ accounts of art education in America. (Goldstein 1996, Singerman 1999, Elkins 2001).\r\n\r\nGuided by Pevsner’s Academies, my project develops through site visits to European Art Academies, where I photograph life drawing and anatomy rooms and collect historical imagery from archives. No longer the height of art theory, the life room is the historical object of this thesis, analysed as the remains of a previous fine art system, and as a space of fantasy. Juxtaposing original material  gathered on site visits with their reproduction in Pevsner’s book I offer a re-reading which considers the tradition of copying in the academy with that of the mechanisms of reproduction in modernity. My use of photography in the life room abuts one system with the other, while image maps follow each chapter using the convention of the image essay and Warburg’s Mnemosyne Atlas. My chapters prepare a context in which my photographs can be read as traces of a much older tradition of observation,  representation and pedagogy. I consider the anatomy theatre in relation to the life room and questions of feminism, representation and the female body. I move on to the Bauhaus and the rejection of academic art and finally to of the Hornsey Sit-in of 1968 and the\r\nColdstream Report, where the relationship of theory to practice, and to the ‘academic’ in art education is fiercely debated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Salaman, Naomi"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The ambition was to produce prototypes, exhibitions and debates that would move scientific research out of laboratories into public spaces. \r\n\r\nFour designers facilitated the work. They developed relationships with biomedical and cybernetic researchers at UK labs and institutes, guiding a design process in which unfinished scientific research became embodied in speculative products.

This paper first explores sinks both as a cultural figure of environmental understanding, and as an important technoscientific instrument within current attempts to describe the global carbon cycle in relation to climate change. The movement of wastes to and through sinks is often characterized as a metabolic operation, and this metabolic framing forms a key part of this investigation. Drawing on Serres’ notion of the parasite, the paper considers how waste, noise and interference may characterize other types of metabolic exchange that allow for a revised approach to sinks. The second section of this paper considers how waste “spills” across environments in space and time. Spills are a way to describe the movement and exchange of wastes that do not conform to a clear trajectory or network, but rather express more formless and even disruptive geographies. Three “spills” then structure this examination into the movement and mutation of waste, including the elusive transfer of carbon found within the “missing sinks” in the biosphere; the indistinct exchanges of carbon and other wastes that occur with human and nonhuman bodies; and the uncertain exchanges and accumulations of carbon wastes in the future. This investigation argues that sinks point toward the revision of the notion that environments are or should be in metabolic balance, in favor of more complex and hybrid ecologies and exchanges that incorporate the transformative capacities of waste. Concluding with Bennett’s discussion of the “ecology of matter,” this paper then suggests that the dynamic qualities of waste and matter require renewed attention to environmental exchanges, practices and imaginings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gabrys, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In this paper it is argued that community should be understood as a moral project as well as a state of affairs or a set of social relationships.  Through reviewing the current debate on the ‘death of multiculturalism’ the political and ethical dimensions of research practice are explored.  The article argues for the development of a cosmopolitan method that reworks the relationship between technology, art and critical social science.  Accounting for the complexities of community require a research imagination that is supple enough to attend to the interplay between local and global levels in order to find new ways of describing how people live in and across social divisions.  Drawing on twenty years of research on the meanings of community in south London the paper explores the limits of interviewing and quantitative measures as they applied to social cohesion or social capital.  It argues for a sensuous mode of scholarship in which the social relations of sound, smell, touch and taste can alert us to the ways in which community is inhabited and lived. The aspiration of this sensuous and multimodal agenda for researching community is to create vital forms of research that capture the conflicts as well as the opportunities that arise in city life.","bibo:AuthorList":["Back, Les"],"dc:date":"2009-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.519978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.519978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The context of such work is one in which a concern with the levels of participation in the political institutions of Western Europe and North America feature prominently in both journalistic and academic debate. The paper speaks to debates that are concerned with the efficacy of specific forms of participation. In doing so we argue that we need to think carefully about the forms of social action that constitute participation in the democratic process. We also need to think precisely about definitions of the political with which people engage. If we take the political as a domain in which the ethical settlement of society is contestable the sorts of mobilisation around faith communities that this paper describes are clearly a form of political participation. Yet the paper argues that the reasons many become involved in these forms of social organisation in contemporary East London is precisely because they are seen as less complicit with mainstream political institutions of the British state.","bibo:AuthorList":["Back, Les","Keith, Michael","Khan, Azra","Shukra, Kalbir","Solomos, J."],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.521506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.432907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.432907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109002,"sim:weight":0.299013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is essential since one of the main applications of slicing is program comprehension. Although our semantics handles non-termination, it is defined wholly in terms of finite trajectories, without having to resort to complex, counter-intuitive, non-standard models of computation. As well as being simpler, unlike other approaches to this problem, our semantics is substitutive. Substitutivity is an important property becauseit greatly enhances the ability to reason about correctness of meaning-preserving program transformations such as slicing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Danicic, Sebastian","Barraclough, Richard","Binkley, David","Harman, Mark","Hierons, Robert","Kiss, Ákos","Laurence, Michael","Ouarbya, Lahcen"],"dc:date":"2010-03-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447999,"sim:weight":0.336415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826866,"sim:weight":0.289343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.264671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999162,"sim:weight":0.220278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.192621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.192621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Observers were required to provide a continuous rating of their sense of presence using a handheld slider. The first experiment investigated the effects of manipulating stereoscopic and motion parallax cues within video sequences presented on a 20 in. stereoscopic CRT display. The results showed that the presentation of both stereoscopic and motion parallax cues was associated with higher presence ratings. One possible interpretation of Experiment 1 is that CRT displays that contain the spatial cues of stereoscopic disparity and motion parallax are more interesting or engaging. To test this, observers in Experiment 2 rated the same stimuli first for interest and then for presence. The results showed that variations in interest did not predict the presence ratings obtained in Experiment 1. However, the subsequent ratings of presence differed significantly from those obtained in Experiment 1, suggesting that prior experience with interest ratings affected subsequent judgments of presence. To test this, Experiment 3 investigated the effects of prior experience on presence ratings. Three groups of observers rated a training sequence for interest, presence, and 3-Dness before rating the same stimuli as used for Experiments 1 and 2 for presence. The results demonstrated that prior ratings sensitize observers to different features of a display resulting in different presence ratings. The implications of these results for presence evaluation are discussed, and a combination of more-refined subjective measures and a battery of objective measures is recommended.","bibo:AuthorList":["Freeman, Jonathan","Avons, Steve","Pearson, Don E.","Ijsselsteijn, Wijnand"],"dc:date":"1999","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999506,"sim:weight":0.543677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102678,"sim:weight":0.479267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.450604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.450039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.448171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.448171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.446382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.446382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.438038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.416949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.416949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631613,"sim:weight":0.356699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.355227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.345168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.31332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86557,"sim:weight":0.308547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.275785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.274167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.274167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.264368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Objective measures of the behavioral realism elicited by a display offer an alternative to subjective ratings. Behavioral measures and presence are linked by the premise that, when observers experience a mediated environment (VE or broadcast) that makes them feel present, they will respond to stimuli within the environment as they would to stimuli in the real world. The experiment presented here measured postural responses to a video sequence filmed from the hood of a car traversing a rally track, using stereoscopic and monoscopic presentation. Results demonstrated a positive effect of stereoscopic presentation on the magnitude of postural responses elicited. Posttest subjective ratings of presence, vection, and involvement were also higher for stereoscopically presented stimuli. The postural and subjective measures were not significantly correlated, indicating that nonproprioceptive postural responses are unlikely to provide accurate estimates of presence. Such postural responses may prove useful for the evaluation of displays for specific applications and in the corroboration of group subjective ratings of presence, but cannot be taken in place of subjective ratings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Freeman, Jonathan","Avons, Steve","Meddis, Ray","Pearson, Don E.","Ijsselsteijn, Wijnand"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45409,"sim:weight":0.295388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the process, Islam had succeeded in pushing indigenous religious and cultural practices such as Bori to the margins or underground. However, while most of the other indigenous forms died or became inactive and ineffectual, Bori has managed to hold its own against the persecution and cultural war waged against it by Islam, mainly because the belief in the power and ability of the spirits to influence human life which is at the centre of Bori practice was never lost.

{"identifier":1445115,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The Inbetweeners: The Korean Animation Industry Negotiates the Global and the National","bibo:abstract":"This thesis examines the (South) Korean animation industry in between the global and the national. Since the 1990s, the Korean animation industry has tried to shift from being a subordinated ‘in-betweener’ (i.e. subcontracting for the USA and Japan) to becoming an autonomous agent (i.e. producing its own animations). What exactly initiated this change? Can it be perhaps understood as the response to the globalisation process? Or, can it be, in fact, Korea’s constantly contested nationalism under the guise of capital force of globalisation? How does this change our understanding of globalisation as process? More importantly, how do animators experience globalisation in their daily lives and work conditions?\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, the thesis focuses on (1) how the local creative industry recognises and realises the dynamics between the global and national; (2) how the local creative producers experience negotiating local and global values in their daily lives and work. As Korea is a globally challenged nation with constantly contested national identity, the Korean animation industry is a potent site for examining ambivalent identity formation through these ‘in-between’ negotiation processes. People’s everyday experiences and ‘emotional’ struggles in-between the two major forces of nationalism and globalisation have been relatively neglected in research so far. This focus leads me to suggest the idea of ‘in-between’ not just as subcontracting but as a concept. In contrast to celebration of hybridity as ambivalence and/or resistance to both globalisation and nationalism, ‘in-betweeness’ captures the subjective experience generated from hybridity and realised through social and emotional tension in lived experiences and work. Being in-between is understood as a negotiation, transition and dis/juncture of different experiences of globalisation, along which Korean animators experience conflicts, dilemmas and confusion and hesitations about which direction to head in. It results in the creation of an ambivalent and often agonized in between identity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yoon, Ae-Ri"],"dc:date":"2010-01-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48378,"sim:weight":0.540445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931334,"sim:weight":0.427611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999527,"sim:weight":0.403879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.390816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.380197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051380,"sim:weight":0.375372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8329,"sim:weight":0.368589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.358144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051370,"sim:weight":0.356307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98711,"sim:weight":0.349888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46636,"sim:weight":0.349352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.341343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":209501,"sim:weight":0.338535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43495,"sim:weight":0.33551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.328265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.326724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15239,"sim:weight":0.326398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.323085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89116,"sim:weight":0.322939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051381,"sim:weight":0.319871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The chapter opens with an introduction to savant talent, to issues in relation to domain-specificity and modularity, as well as the role of practice and implicit memory. These topics have been picked out because of their relevance to memory and also because of associations with autism. Three sections then follow which focus on savant memory performance amongst numerical and calendar calculators, musicians and artists, where the evidence from empirical studies is placed in the context of the issues raised in the Introduction. Finally, a theoretical interpretation is presented which, it is argued, provides a convincing account of the development of savant abilities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pring, Linda","Boucher, Jill","Bowler, Dermot"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443558,"sim:weight":0.807094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":310156,"sim:weight":0.805691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446973,"sim:weight":0.609987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446977,"sim:weight":0.566353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446981,"sim:weight":0.548844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82248,"sim:weight":0.456485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56478,"sim:weight":0.444267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99256,"sim:weight":0.389056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82244,"sim:weight":0.357009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.334329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.289479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.287861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.284644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.254004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.250903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69860,"sim:weight":0.241172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58755,"sim:weight":0.231786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108179,"sim:weight":0.23,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.228975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.227601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Children with profound visual impairment (PVI) and severe visual impairment (SVI) were compared to a group of typically developing sighted children in their ability to respond to adult  directed attention in terms of establishing, maintaining, and shifting attention on toys.\r\n\r\nThe measures of children’s sensory-motor understanding (SMU) and language ability were obtained using the Reynell–Zinkin scales of mental development. The videorecordings of these play-based assessments were coded for three categories of behavioural responses (Establish, Maintain, and Shift). The three groups were matched on verbal comprehension (VC), but differed significantly in their SMU and their chronological age. The groups of children with PVI and SVI were found to be comparable in their ability to establish and maintain attention on objects. Despite a relatively good performance overall both groups scored significantly lower on those skills than children who were sighted. However, with regards to attention shifting, children with PVI showed significantly lower performance than both the children with SVI and the sighted children who were similar on this component. Ability to maintain and shift attention was significantly related to the cognitive ability of children with PVI; however the poorer attentional responses were not confined only to the children with low IQ. The results are discussed in relation to the role of vision, cognitive ability and executive function in attentional processes in children with congenital VI.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tadić, Valerie","Pring, Linda","Dale, Naomi"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The current series of studies assessed whether the autobiographical memory difficulties observed in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) could be due to problems in using the self as an effective memory cue. A series of cueing paradigms were used to assess the accessibility of both specific and general autobiographical knowledge relating to (i) currently pursued goals (either high or low in self-concordance) and (ii) goals that participants were not currently pursuing. Results demonstrated that while event-specific knowledge was impaired in the ASD group, general event knowledge appeared relatively intact. Moreover, while both event-specific and general event knowledge were organised around goals of the self in control participants, a corresponding relationship was only observed for general event knowledge in the ASD group.","bibo:AuthorList":["Crane, Laura","Goddard, Lorna","Pring, Linda"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We measured the Ebbinghaus illusion under varying levels of working memory load to test whether cognitive control is also relevant for preventing processing of distractors that do not produce any response conflict, and instead affect target processing at the perceptual level. The Ebbinghaus illusion was greater under high working memory load, suggesting that availability of cognitive control functions is critical to reduce distractor processing even for distractors that are not associated with a response. We conclude that the effect of loading working memory during selective attention leads to greater distractor perception.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fockert, Jan W. de","Wu, Si"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443547,"sim:weight":0.632677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9046560,"sim:weight":0.432638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.346425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443253,"sim:weight":0.319059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88413,"sim:weight":0.296975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.291502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.281445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.281445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.281404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.274299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.274299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.269866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710600,"sim:weight":0.268692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.26447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.26447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.262587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26675,"sim:weight":0.258609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98622,"sim:weight":0.249649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98776,"sim:weight":0.234932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99071,"sim:weight":0.232205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Parent-rated prosocial behaviour also differentially predicted social acceptance; high-levels of prosocial behaviour predicted acceptance in comparison students, but low-levels were predictive for students with ASD.

Its focus is on the encounters of people of colour (defined for the purposes of this study as people of African, Asian and Caribbean descent) with Western convert Buddhist movements, which tend to be predominantly white and middle-class.\r\nThe study uses an ethnographic case study approach informed by feminist epistemologies.  The case-studies are of two of the largest Western convert Buddhist movements in the UK – the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO) and Soka Gakkai International-UK (SGI-UK) – and focus on their branches in the multicultural inner-city location of East London.  The findings suggest that most Buddhists of colour in these movements come from the second generation of the diaspora.  For the FWBO, there is an apparently hegemonic discourse of middle-class whiteness that people of colour and working class members of this movement have to negotiate as part of their involvement.  In contrast, for SGI-UK, the ethos is one of a moral cosmopolitanism that encourages intercultural dialogue thus facilitating the involvement of a considerably more multicultural and international following.  People of colour find that their practices of the techniques of the self provided by each movement enable them to feel more empowered in relation to their quotidian experience of racisms and racialisation, as well as encouraging them in a more anti-essentialist approach to identity that sees it as fluid and contingent.\r\nTo date, there has been little discussion of how Western Buddhism is developing in multiethnic and multicultural contexts, even though the West has long been a space of significant ethnic and cultural diversity arising largely from processes of colonialism and imperialism.  This study therefore develops a new line of enquiry for consideration in studies seeking to illuminate the issue of how Buddhism is being translated in the West.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Sharon Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108685,"sim:weight":0.717431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633009,"sim:weight":0.644733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43930,"sim:weight":0.642691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43658,"sim:weight":0.642092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9430001,"sim:weight":0.624554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229908,"sim:weight":0.608841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4757,"sim:weight":0.607971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.599455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.59061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.585334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83158,"sim:weight":0.557786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17177,"sim:weight":0.55575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.555182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.550678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5066307,"sim:weight":0.548863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446416,"sim:weight":0.540326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309497,"sim:weight":0.537552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764405,"sim:weight":0.535776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1138839,"sim:weight":0.530656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89116,"sim:weight":0.529968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This may be because of the nature of the tasks used, the heterogeneity of participants, and difficulties with recruiting appropriate control groups. A comprehensive battery of ‘executive’ tests was administered to 22 individuals with Asperger syndrome and 22 well-matched controls. Performance was analysed both between groups and on an individual basis to identify outliers in both the ASD and control groups. There were no differences between the groups on all ‘classical’ tests of executive function. However, differences were found on newer tests of executive function. Specifically, deficits in planning, abstract problem solving and especially multitasking. On the tests that discriminated the groups, all of the ASD individuals except one were identified as significantly impaired (i.e. below the 5th percentile of the control mean) on at least one executive measure. This study provides evidence for significant executive dysfunction in Asperger syndrome. Greatest dysfunction appeared in response initiation and intentionality at the highest level—the ability to engage and disengage actions in the service of overarching goals. These deficits are best observed through using more recent, ecologically valid tests of executive dysfunction. Moreover, performance on these measures correlated with autistic symptomatology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hill, Elisabeth L.","Bird, Chris M."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"E L Hill and C M Bird.

This information is conveyed largely bodily with postures, gestures and facial expression. In order to capture the Kansei aspects of human interaction within a virtual environment, it is therefore vital to model this bodily interaction. This type of interaction is largely subconscious and therefore difficult to model explicitly.

We investigated the relationship between mentalising and three types of strategic games - Prisoners\u0027 Dilemma, Dictator and Ultimatum - in children with and without autistic spectrum disorders. Overall, the results revealed less dramatic differences than expected among the normally developing age groups and the children with autism, suggesting that in these laboratory tasks, mentalising skills are not always necessary. There were, nonetheless, some important findings. Young children were more cautious about initiating cooperation than their older peers and, in bargaining situations, they were less generous in their opening unilateral grants and over-solicitous of an empowered receiver. Participants with autism did have a harder time shifting strategy between versions of the Prisoners\u0027 Dilemma, and they were much more likely to accept low initial offers in the Ultimatum game and to refuse fair proposals. In addition, participants\u0027 measured mentalising abilities explain intentional and strategic behaviour within the prisoners\u0027 dilemma and the avoidance of unsuccessful ultimatum proposals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sally, David","Hill, Elisabeth L."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4870866,"sim:weight":0.538052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71305,"sim:weight":0.459861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.435917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87201,"sim:weight":0.433262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.376368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.366863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.362953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.362953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.329603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108769,"sim:weight":0.323862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.267579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To assess this we sought responses to two alexithymia self-reports and a depression self-report at two time points from adults with and without ASD. Materials and methods. – An initial sample of 27 adults withASD and 35 normal adults completed the 20-item Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20), the Bermond and Vorst alexithymia questionnaire-form B (BVAQ-B), and the Beck depression inventory (BDI), at test time 1. Of these individuals, 19 ASD and 29 controls participated again after a period ranging from 4 to 12 months. Results. – ASD participants were able to report about their own emotions using self-reports. BVAQ-B showed reasonable convergent validity and test–retest reliability in both groups. Scores on both alexithymia scales were stable across the two participant groups. However, results revealed that although the TAS-20 total score discriminated between the two groups at both time points, the BVAQ-B total score did not. Moreover, the TAS-20 showed stronger test–retest reliability than the BVAQ-B. Conclusion. – ASD participants appeared more depressed and more alexithymic than the controls. The use of the BVAQ-B, as an additional assessment of alexithymia, indicated that ASD patients have a specific type of alexithymia characterised by increased difficulties in the cognitive domain rather than the affective aspects of alexithymia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Berthoz, Sylvie","Hill, Elisabeth L."],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2005).

Sixteen adults with Asperger Syndrome and 24 controls, matched for age and intelligence, were presented with sets of faces, bodies and objects, which had to be rated on a 7-point scale in terms of trustworthiness, attractiveness, social status, and age, or, in the case of objects, price. Despite impaired performance on two important aspects of social cognition (second-order mentalizing and face recognition) the social judgements of the individuals with Asperger Syndrome were just as competent and consistent as those of their matched controls, with only one exception: there was a trend for them to be less able to judge the attractiveness of faces if they were the same sex. We explain this difference in terms of a weakness in mentalizing, specifically the ability to take a different point of view: While all other stereotypic attributions could be made from an egocentric point of view, judging the attractiveness of faces of one\u0027s own sex requires taking the perspective of someone of the opposite sex, a challenge for people with mentalizing problems. We conclude that individuals with Asperger Syndrome show preserved aspects of social knowledge, as revealed in the attribution of stereotypes to pictures of people. These findings suggest that there are dissociable subcomponents to social cognition and that not all of these are compromised in Asperger Syndrome.","bibo:AuthorList":["White, Sarah","Hill, Elisabeth L.","Winston, Joel","Frith, Uta"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The show reflects on post-feminism as anti-feminism where invidious forms of oppression are obsequiously returned through the discourse of the free market and consumer culture. New forms of individuality and self-objectification concur with the old forms of the to-be-looked-at-ness of femininity.\r\nIn the video Martha Rosler Reads “Vogue” (1982) Martha Rosler examines the ideology of the fashion industry. The work coincides historically with the moment a backlash against feminism was first identified and the term Post-Feminist was coined. The values Rosler interrogated then are now ubiquitous within popular culture, but granted legitimacy through the seeming incorporation of feminism within mainstream politics.\r\nAlison Jones depicts the ongoing asymmetry of women’s relation to power through the parade of private wealth and culture as seen through the lens of W magazine. Women are photographed contemplating the high art photographs of Helmut Newton and Thomas Ruff. Newton’s models pose undressed at sybaritic feasts or as objects on pedestal tables; Ruff rephotographs anonymous internet pornography. \r\nMilly Thompson’s graphic digital prints are aestheticised utterances reiterating the subliminal messages of aspiration and desire.

Independent adult raters consistently used four out of fourteen error-types and for these four, inter-rater reliability was found to be good. The type of errors made by children with DCD, SLI and the younger controls were very similar. The only difference between the groups was in the frequency with which errors were displayed, suggesting that the performance of the clinical children might be an indicator of immature praxis development.

However, executive impairments have not always been easy to identify consistently and so novel \"ecologically valid\" tests have been designed which tap into real-life scenarios that are relevant to and representative of everyday behavior. One characteristic of many of these tasks is that they present the participant with an \"ill-structured\" or \"open-ended\" situation. Here, we investigated the possibility that tasks with greater degrees of open-endedness might prove more sensitive to detecting executive impairment in autism. Forty-five children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were compared to 27 age- and IQ-matched control children on a range of cognitive tests of EF. Group differences were found on half of the tasks, with the greatest degree of impairment detected on the more open-ended tasks. The ASD group also performed more poorly on a simple control condition of a task. Detailed consideration of task performance suggested that the ASD group tended to create fewer spontaneous strategies and exhibit more idiosyncratic behavior, which particularly disadvantaged them on the more open-ended tasks. These kinds of behaviors have been reported in studies of neurological patients with frontal lobe involvement, prima facie suggesting a link between the scientific fields. However, we suggest that this behavior might equally result from a poor understanding of the implicit demands made by the experimenter in open-ended test situations, due to the socio-communicative difficulties of these children.","bibo:AuthorList":["White, S.J.","Burgess, P.W.","Hill, Elisabeth L."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":124961,"sim:weight":0.307235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The latter also predicts impairments in the ability to monitor basic actions. Our three studies failed to support either of these views. Experiment 1 demonstrated intact abilities in the monitoring of basic actions (detecting which stimulus of a number of stimuli one is controlling). Experiment 2 demonstrated intact abilities in reporting an intention, both for self and for another agent, when the outcome was unintended but desired. In Experiment 3, using the novel “transparent intentions task”, we found (with a minor qualification) intact ability in reporting on nonballistic intended actions when the result that the action achieved was unexpected.

Using a critical sociological framework combined with a neo-Foucauldian understanding of work and subjectivity, a series of explicit analytical connections are made in this project, between screenwriting, creative labour and the new cultural economy. I contend that screenwriting, as a form of creative labour which in many ways eschews the term ‘creative’, is an instructive, timely case study precisely because it agitates traditional dichotomies - between creativity and craft, art and commerce, individual and collaborative work - in pedagogy and practice.\r\n\r\nAfter tracing the dynamics of this form of creative work in theoretical, discursive and historical terms, I then analyse how screenwriting is constructed, taught and practiced as labour in three areas: ‘How-to’ screenwriting manuals, pedagogical locations for screenwriting in the UK and British screenwriters’ working lives. At each site, I focus on how craft and creativity are defined and experienced, how individual and collective forms of work are enacted at different locations and what implications these shifting designations have. Screenwriting within the mainstream Hollywood and British film industries in the contemporary moment demands particular and complex forms of worker subjectivity in order to distinguish it from other forms of filmmaking and writing, and to make the work knowable and do-able. I follow the voices of screenwriters and those who teach and instruct about screenwriting across the fieldwork sites and analyse the ways in which they calculate, navigate and make sense of the screen production labour market in which they are immersed. The theatrical, mythic and practical navigations of screenwriters in pedagogy and practice that are the centre of this thesis offer an antidote to impoverished, economistic readings of creativity, craft and creative labour in contemporary worlds of work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Conor, Bridget Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2010-03-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1151455,"sim:weight":0.611233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77244,"sim:weight":0.604661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.593242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.589711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":135198,"sim:weight":0.574312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8329,"sim:weight":0.573653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.573353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146086,"sim:weight":0.572666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17178,"sim:weight":0.572426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9321182,"sim:weight":0.571467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82073,"sim:weight":0.570616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94700,"sim:weight":0.567368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710150,"sim:weight":0.567205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.563287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83215,"sim:weight":0.562521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5285,"sim:weight":0.562495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2837,"sim:weight":0.556079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81261,"sim:weight":0.554006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666,"sim:weight":0.553217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17180,"sim:weight":0.553027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Given the nature of the reflection – opening the question of otherness from within Heidegger – the research will also articulate a dialogue between Nancy and Levinas. Through the examination of Nancy’s reading of Heidegger, the dissertation will then endeavor to establish the original gesture of Nancy’s contribution to philosophy, which will be identified in the concept of powers of existence. Under the light of the analysis of the three concepts which structure the work, the conclusions will define powers of existence as singular resistances of existence to the mastering decision of philosophical work. This being the case philosophy will in turn continuously loosen its categories and key words in the attempt to decide its course according to what happens between us. The opening of a series of incommensurable measures responds to the demand existence casts on philosophical work. The problem of otherness is thus resolved as the work of powers of existence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rugo, Daniele"],"dc:date":"2010-03-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47099,"sim:weight":0.737239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46635,"sim:weight":0.696119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731470,"sim:weight":0.691664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051965,"sim:weight":0.668311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47165,"sim:weight":0.664972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352156,"sim:weight":0.656543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":791370,"sim:weight":0.654476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4213,"sim:weight":0.651792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48384,"sim:weight":0.648022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108253,"sim:weight":0.647747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":585311,"sim:weight":0.63485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555269,"sim:weight":0.614469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108705,"sim:weight":0.60722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47303,"sim:weight":0.600786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46625,"sim:weight":0.600074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71509,"sim:weight":0.595948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2690965,"sim:weight":0.58879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":585310,"sim:weight":0.584847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108318,"sim:weight":0.580406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1029108,"sim:weight":0.575557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Much of this work has tried to get out of the conceptual frameworks that usually render African cities as failed cities, cities always in need of something more — whether it be infrastructure, governance, or economic development. As David Satterthwaite so ably demonstrates, cities in the global South in general are caught in a series of powerful myths that represent them as more parasitic and more economically fragmented than cities elsewhere. The prevailing notion is that of an urban fabric overrun, unable to accommodate all of the escalating demands made of it; of environmental degradation spawned by widespread impoverishment; and of increased social conflict among residents who find few institutional platforms to promote coherence and collaboration. In the following discussion, I emphasize the implications of trying to see the emerging fabric of urban Africa as the result of a productive deployment of sensibilities, practices, effort, and collective formations that are made possible by the very uncertainties incumbent within cities deeply punctuated by fragmented infrastructures, social contestation over the uses to be made of the city, and political regimes thoroughly made partial through their entanglement within diverse networks of exchange. In particular, this essay deals with the often peculiar process through which actors come to make their mark on collective transactions and the way in which idiosyncratic constellations of such actors provide a workable balance between the provisional and incessantly mutating practices required to viably “make do” in most African cities and a sense of order, if only temporary.","bibo:AuthorList":["Simone, AbdouMaliq"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Care experiences of young people in an inner city borough","bibo:abstract":"This thesis is an engagement with the care experiences of mixed young people, to\r\nproduce knowledge of how care processes, mediated though the private foster family,\r\nimpact on their lives. It begins with an examination of the relationship between the\r\nmixed classification and care, and continues through a discussion of race, race mixing\r\nand the family. The study then examines methodologically how the mixed classification\r\noperates in social work through a discussion of racialisation and its impact on the care\r\ntrajectory of young people. Further, it engages with long-standing debates over why\r\nyoung people with a mixed classification are more likely to be significantly represented in\r\ncare. The empirical chapters are comprised of the narrative accounts and visual\r\nrepresentations of the young people and their experiences in care.\r\n\r\nA highly participatory research methodology paid critical attention to the narratives of\r\nmixed young people in care between the ages of 12-20 years, as research participants, in\r\norder to engage and elicit rich detail about their care experiences.

My aim was to test this assumption, and to explore more widely the similarities and differences between the experience of music in the normal population and those with autism. My first study used musically-induced mood changes and a behavioural measure to show that music does indeed have a more than superficial effect on cognitive processes in a control group. The second study focused on high-functioning adults on the autism spectrum, using semi-structured interviews to investigate the part that music played in their everyday lives, concluding that autism is no bar to full appreciation of the emotional uses of music, though suggesting a degree of impoverishment in the language they used to describe the emotions. The final set of experiments compared control and autism group directly, using physiological (GSR) measures of arousal together with self-report of the emotions evoked by a set of musical items. Standardised questionnaires were used to measure alexithymia (difficulty in identifying and describing feelings) in individuals. Although the autism group experienced comparable levels of physiological arousal to music, they used fewer words than the control group to describe their emotional responses, a difference which correlated strongly with their level of alexithymia. My results are consistent with the hypothesis that in autism, the basic physiological and emotional component of their reactivity to music is functioning normally, but that their ability to translate these reactions into conventional emotional language is reduced, precisely in line with the extent of their alexithymia. These results suggest that the preserved ability of music to generate emotional arousal in autism may lead to clinical applications for the treatment of alexithymia in autism and other conditions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allen, Rory"],"dc:date":"2010-02-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":89140,"sim:weight":0.849529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445784,"sim:weight":0.845462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999508,"sim:weight":0.826638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98629,"sim:weight":0.714338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.673356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387078,"sim:weight":0.623455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.594135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99256,"sim:weight":0.585672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5837463,"sim:weight":0.575779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47309,"sim:weight":0.562206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.559784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108280,"sim:weight":0.555666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44390,"sim:weight":0.553084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9017911,"sim:weight":0.544756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387055,"sim:weight":0.542322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83316,"sim:weight":0.517846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914780,"sim:weight":0.513224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1117408,"sim:weight":0.510464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443555,"sim:weight":0.505139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88716,"sim:weight":0.505139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

His works explore the legacies and mine the fictions that form around movements and experiments - be they in the systems of art, mind-altering substances or the occult. \r\n\r\nPoison Protocols and Other Histories pays attention to Koester‘s exploration of invisible and forgotten histories of transgression, tracing a line through the artist’s films and photographs. This exhibition takes a journey through stories of Carlos Castaneda’s magical passes and the Manson ‘family’, histories of conceptual photography and the opium trade, as well as the fears and desires of alternative perceptual registers. Each work addresses how history has the ability to not only to reflect experience, but also to construct and create it through speculation. Koester echoes in his investigations the magic at the heart of photography that fold the past into the future and the known into the imagined, a process that arrests time and captures possibilities. \r\nKoester shows four films and selections from six photographic series in Poison Protocols and Other Histories. For Stills he has produced a new series of photographs, Time of the Assassins, investigating the legend of the  ‘hashsishns’ – a story embraced by the group of writers mid-19th Century Parisians who formed the Hashish Club.

The artists share an interest in the emblematic: re-negotiating visual structures that signify affiliation and commemoration. Things such as crests, mascots, badges and motifs that reflect activities, rituals and artifacts that might be attached to a clubhouse or headquarters, church or local pub.\r\n \r\nAs both artists move their ‘HQ’ into the gallery you will be invited to contemplate works that suggest evidence of communal activity and inclusiveness that simultaneously lay down cultural and territorial difference.\r\n \r\nMark Pearson’s large scale drawings and dubious DIY assemblages are brutal and muscular assertions fusing established artistic codes with vulgar and vernacular references. He invests redundant symbols of urban mythology, typical of pub interiors and public memorial sculptures with a new found energy and power. Pearson contrasts a genuine delight in working with these anachronistic motifs with the knowledge of what they reveal about a subculture hanging on to spurious ideas of homogenous identity, masculinity and historical authenticity.\r\n \r\nMark Pearson completed his MA at Goldsmiths College in 2000. Recent exhibitions include: ‘Sorry for not Making’ Moot, Nottingham , 2008. ‘Drunken Boat’, Colony, Birmingham , 2007. ‘Intoposition’, Bauernmarkt1, Vienna , 2007. ‘Metropolis Rise, New Art from London ’, Beijing \u0026 Shanghai , 2007.\r\n \r\nCentral to Annie Whiles concerns is the juxtaposition of public and private activity, ordinary and extraordinary event. Her practice negotiates a relationship between art and artifact. She is known for her oversized embroidered badges and honed line drawings of ordinary objects as metonymic emblems or talismanic objects.

From our clothes to the fly curtain, not to mention the unrequested and often undesired advertising leaflets or packs of fruit juice. It is primarily the colourful nature of this world, which has become self-evident to us, that Laura White researches and uses in her installation for Chromodomo. \u2028White blurs the boundaries between the existing interior, the furniture, and the new items she introduces. She creates compilations of objects with which we are thoroughly familiar, in combination with added constructions made of clay, among other things. The installation in the Wall House acquires extra significance due to the fact that White draws inspiration from the remarkably awkward drawings by John Hejduk, the architect of the Wall House, featuring animals with masks and strange angels, occasionally with reed aprons. Keeping these drawings in mind, White researches the Wall House via Hejduk’s universe. Tables may wear aprons, and by means of the mounds of clay she pulls the ‘outside’ inside once again. Hejduk would have been most amused.                     \r\nBy Kie Ellen, Director of The Wall House #2.","bibo:AuthorList":["White, Laura"],"dc:date":"2009-09-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447229,"sim:weight":0.273997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Laura White acted as a curator and participator. \r\n\r\nSTUFF.\r\n\r\nArtists included Alison Wilding, Laura White, Phyllida Barlow, Bettina Buck.\r\n\r\nExhibition Description:\r\nSculpture is the need to arrange, to juxtapose and to navigate space, to handle matter and exist within the stuff that the world is made up of. The artists selected for this exhibition are exploring the realms of contemporary sculpture, with a freedom and experimentation that constantly breaks and makes up its own rules.\r\nThe history of modernism in sculpture cannot be ignored or forgotten, so it is with these artists that there is a negotiation of its memory, while skipping on its grave in absolute openness. Abstraction meets representation, form with the formless, traditional materials with the readymade, craftsmanship with child play, the architectural with the personal, functional with the ornamental, and anything that doesn’t go with all that does.\r\n\r\nSTUFF was part of a large project: Don’t Open this Door if You Can’t Close it. The Wenlock Building was occupied by 28 exhibitions by galleries and artists during the Frieze Art Fair. It had an enormous audience of the general public, galleries, artists and collectors.\r\n\r\nThe Wharf Road Project brings more than 20 innovative contemporary art initiatives together for the first time in a central location, creating a seminal showcase for the more unusual and innovative. The Wharf Road Project is not an art fair, but a large-scale exhibition featuring the best of London’s specialist and experimental art spaces, complemented by a programme of performances, screenings, music and guided tours.\r\nParticipants have each been allocated one of the 5-storey venue’s rooms to curate exhibitions which reflect their artistic endeavours and curatorial ethos. This mash-up of different organisations will create an opportunity to engage with established art spaces as well as some of the newest and most exciting art initiatives in London.\r\nThe Wenlock building is owned by Workspace Group plc who have long been supporters of the arts and London‘s creative industries. V22 is the first cooperatively run art collection, owned by artists themselves as well as external investor-patrons. Our ethos is to make the best new art accessible to more people in more ways. The Wharf Road Project is a celebration of artists, their supporters and the wider industry. V22 will feature new works for its collection selected by Martin Westwood and Martin Creed.","bibo:AuthorList":["White, Laura"],"dc:date":"2008-10-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Not what the moving red neon sign says - but the fiery pool reflecting it in the asphalt.\u0027 \r\nBenjamin, One-Way Street\r\n\r\n\u0027The parade has nothing to do with women, everything to do with men... Women are simply the scenery onto which men project their narcissistic fantasies.\u0027 \r\nMulvey, Visual \u0026 Other Pleasures\r\n\r\nWith invested irony, Simon Bedwell makes drip paintings from used advertising posters, in a messy conflation of an \u0027abstract\u0027 language deconstructed to the point of bathos, and the full-colour, pouting, literal end of corporate seduction. There is a melancholy to these actions, too: imminent replacement by plasma screens makes paper advertising as redundant as the flaccid, glistening gestures they\u0027re covered with.\r\n\r\n\u0027The Department store is, in a sense, the poor-man\u0027s art gallery … there, people do not feel themselves measured against transcendent norms, that is, the principles of the life-style of a supposedly higher class, but feel free to judge freely, in the name of the legitimate arbitrariness of tastes and colours.\u0027 \r\nBourdieu, Distinction\r\n\r\nHow do we value the things we surround ourselves with? Women are supposed to care for such things, whilst men - whose manliness is guaranteed by being outside, busy, working - involve themselves at the risk of revealing a lack of robustness to their heterosexuality. To gender a man\u0027s space is to sexualise it; there are only the most simplistic corporate models for the (hetero) male\u0027s interior. If to display is unmanly, what are the things men should have around them? Conflating department stores and bachelor pads, lifestyle shops and lofts, sexual consumerism and museums, Simon Bedwell will exhibit a series of new compositions: objects found, made and adjusted, in walk-through, still-life arrangements of banal, desultory precision.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bedwell, Simon A."],"dc:date":"2009-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447229,"sim:weight":0.365408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445330,"sim:weight":0.290377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999286,"sim:weight":0.265137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445337,"sim:weight":0.221569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

En instrumentalisant et en diffusant des images \"pauvres\" dépourvues de connotation esthétique, la photographie conceptuelle révèle le primat donné à l’idée au détriment de la valeur esthétique voire de la réalisation elle-même de l’œuvre. En remettant en cause la vision traditionnelle de l’art, les artistes sélectionnés offrent en aperçu de cette pratique des années 50 aux années 80 telle qu’elle a pu se développer autour de la thématique du corps humain. -- \r\n\r\nUne des définitions de l’art conceptuel qu’on doit à Lucy Lippard, est qu’il correspond à des œuvres où « l’idée est de la plus haute importance et sa forme matérielle accessoire, éphémère, pauvre, sans prétentions et / ou \"dématérialisée\"».1  -- \r\n\r\nLa photographie conceptuelle a de façon évidente des liens étroits voire gémellaires, avec l’art conceptuel, d’abord parce qu’elle constitue souvent la seule trace des œuvres ou des actions définies comme conceptuelles, et aussi parce qu’à un moment donné, elle a trouvé les voies d’une autonomie formelle qui lui donne toute sa validité intrinsèque. S’éloignant d’une tradition solidement ancrée de l’œuvre unique et à la faveur de l’acceptation de principe du multiple, l’image photographique s’est ouvert un champ diversifié où la notion de représentation fidèle au réel n’est plus la loi.

Main problems for using SCs are: [1] that of defining a type of object and gathering enough reliable examples of that type to calculate its absolute luminosity; [2] the post-definitional problem of actually recognizing ultra-distant examples of the type in practice. As well as measuring space the SC is a distance indicator also for time, meaning the ultra-distant past from which light has travelled. The works in the show mark their relations to painting as mediated through tactics of display and (counter-)periodisation.

Curated by Danielle Arnaud and Matthew Poole.\r\nThe artists in the exhibition explore how their \u0027authorship\u0027 or \u0027individuality\u0027 is expressed as images. Here, artworks are produced that deal with the public face of the personal, private or local. In brief, the thematic of this exhibition is interested in the consequence and legitimacy of \u0027individual choice\u0027 as a genre or style. Hence, Family Business looks to artworks that claim, utilise and reflect upon languages of both the institutional and the personal.\r\nThe term \u0027family business\u0027 suggests an idea of groups of individuals with an internal system of rules, who get on with life largely unaffected by the demands of external pressures and laws. Within this observation one might recognise the character of tawdry soap opera, \u0027Mob-style\u0027 or Mafia drama, or even such subversive establishments as the Masonic Lodge. These \u0027self-ruling\u0027 communities don\u0027t show power to be an anonymous or faceless force, but something personal and local.\r\nTaking up this theme, the artworks directly explore notions of authority and power in various circumstances, where all the works acknowledge and critique their proximity to the business of traditional and organised power structures. This is played out in poster works by both Ashton and Beech who combine a language of personal choice-making and gesture with recognisable institutional forms of information, advertising and propaganda; in Putler\u0027s paintings on enlarged National Lottery scratchcards that mix both an ambivalent and an invested attitude towards the weekly lottery draw; and in Jones\u0027 trompe l\u0027oeil wall paintings that make the transient and auxiliary notion of gallery cleaners an irrefutable and even clandestine presence.\r\nArtists involved:\r\nSean Ashton \r\nAmanda Beech \r\nDavid Blandy \r\nAlice Gilbertson \r\nOle Hagen \r\nAlison Jones \r\nSophie Lascelles \r\nLynne Marsh \r\nHelen Maurer \r\nJasone Miranda-Bilbao \r\nDavid Mollin \r\nVictoria Putler \r\nKate Smith \r\nAnnie Whiles","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Alison"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.250503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443360,"sim:weight":0.224788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.178175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.164258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.156904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.156812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929930,"sim:weight":0.142753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Building on previous exhibitions Gents…(2005) and Asphalt World (2009), this new show counterpoints a terse mise-en-scene conflating existential expressionism, décor and misogyny, with a histrionic near self portrait derived from the later work of George Grosz .\r\n\r\nIn the main gallery space, a set of objects evoke style and violence, sincerity and rhetoric, in almost equal measure. For the wall-size Untitled (Background) Bedwell revisits pour-painting, saddled with the knowledge that even were good faith possible, it would still read as quotation: be destined, like his The Chair of the Painter of the Hole, Booth or Ashtray, despite their devastation, and like anything in any art gallery - to decorate.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\nIn the second space is a conflation of Grosz\u0027s preposterous angst with a contemporary, fully equivocal maleness, Forties Man: Fashions in Trauma 1948-2009. This adjusted transcription of Painter of the Hole (uprooted) had the artist blushing, alone in the studio, brush in hand, so gauche did even copied expression feel.\r\n\r\nThe artist has known Grosz\u0027s Hole work since adolescence. It was always a bit embarrassing with its histrionic, comical expressionism: as silly as The Scream, but more vacillating. But it is nagging, compelling work precisely because of this, speaking as it does of Big Themes, war and the impotence of art (not Lack, tellingly) with such ingenuous, graphic directness. Why it is that we find so very embarrassing art which, with a touching belief in unmediated communication, presumes to address us in language not safely, expectedly ironised? We treat such attempts at contact as we might pub bores or street beggars, hurrying away sheepishly.\r\nPaglia was right to name tragedy a male mode (she could have included its suburban cousin melancholy, too): maybe it\u0027s an idiocy lying in wait for anyone venturing away from the required visible credential, \u0027critical distance\u0027. With artistic possibilities stifled by consumer-led consensus, where to look for a way out of this mannered circumscription? Bedwell seeks in the atmosphere of the forties something useable, which ventures emotion, if only rhetorically and at the cost of comedy - for an artist in his 40s.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bedwell, Simon A."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.233963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108601,"sim:weight":0.213926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.201859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.192225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.191935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":1445442,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Show/Exhibition","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"SO BE IT:INTERVENTIONS IN PRINTED MATTER","bibo:abstract":"“So Be It: Interventions in Printed Matter” explores the diverse, and subversive, history of artist’s interventions. The show includes work by modern pioneers, such as Dieter Roth, Martin Kippenberger, Larry Clark, Robert Heinecken and Hans-Peter Feldmann, as well as younger artists, such as Matt Keegan, Karin Schneider, Sam Lewitt, Simon Bedwell, Jutta Koether and Nicolás Guagnini—all of whose works infiltrate, manipulate, or pre-empt existing printed material and hijack them for a new, often contradictory purpose.\r\n\r\nWhile less sensational or provocative than its performative cousin (for example, Brian Eno urinating in Duchamp’s The Fountain in 1995), the act of print intervention is often a subtler, sometimes invisible, affair. Some artists have insinuated their works into the pages of other magazines: Dieter Roth used a free local advertising bulletin to print short aphorisms so baffling that readers called the paper to have them stopped; and Scott King used the pages of UK magazine Sleazenation to publish images of a football riot, with attention to the rioters’ clothing labels (“jeans by LEE”), as if it were a fashion shoot. Other artists have used printed material—in the form of books, posters, magazines and even napkins and press releases—as the canvas on, or against, which to present their own works, from British group The Bank’s “Fax-Bak” project, to Robert Heinecken’s overprinted magazines, to Martin Kippenberger rubberstamping the word “TOT” (German for ‘dead’) on every page of a Robert Mapplethorpe catalog. Still others have simply taken a printed work’s format and content and scrambled them completely, as is the case of Aleksandra Mir’s feminist mishmash of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Martha Rosler’s confrontational collages, or Collier Schorr’s Jens F., for which Andrew Wyeth’s The Helga Pictures provided a template for revisionist photography.\r\n\r\nThe intervention, and the print intervention in particular, traces its history back at least to the Cubists and their incorporation of newspaper into their compositions. The collages of the Surrealists carried the work into more subversive areas, which culminated in Marcel Duchamp’s mischievous, mustachioed interpolation on La Gioconda, titled L.H.O.O.Q. The print intervention began to find its footing in earnest as Conceptualists and other artists began to work more innovatively with language and the printed word, and it has only continued to grow in its popularity and usage. As Matt Keegan’s “I’ll be your beard if you’ll be my mirror” and its Duchampian echo make clear, artists working today are willing to apply interventionist principles to any object from any facet of modern life. The exhibition “So Be It” takes its name from a very recent example, in which Nicolás Guagnini has silkscreened in a limited edition of 7 copies, a text by Dan Flavin onto the napkins designed for the DIA Foundation by Louise Lawler. The phrase suggests on the one hand a capitulation to the status quo, yet it also implies a decisiveness from which to move forward. All of the works exhibited here arise out of a “so be it” impulse, in an attempt to peel away the veneer and show an image, a word, a condition for what it is, even if it means obscuring it entirely. \r\n\r\nGroup show featuring:\r\nNobuyoshi Araki,  BANK, Simon Bedwell, Larry Clark, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Nicolas Guagnini, Richard Hawkins, Robert Heinecken, Matthias Herrmann, Christian Holstad, Gareth James, Matt Keegan, Scott King, Martin Kippenberger, Jutta Koether, Leigh Ledare, Sam Lewitt, Aleksandra Mi, Martha Rosler, Dieter Roth, Karin Schneider, Collier Schorr, Reena Spaulings, Rirkrit Tiravanija","bibo:AuthorList":["Bedwell, Simon A."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443360,"sim:weight":0.245784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.242985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929930,"sim:weight":0.208671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.205901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This research is publicly manifested in formal workshop sessions, a symposium, a publication, an exhibition and a series of commissions, all in an effort to address the question of how art and art education might resist instrumentalisation by the art market on one hand and the streamlining efforts of the state on the other. To resist this instrumentalisation means to support the idea of a potential within the institution of art for the imagination of an alternative social order. To focus on education is to engage with real political questions about how institutions shape society.\r\n\r\nThe title \u0027Manufacturing Today\u0027 is appropriated from a US and European industry journal. In choosing this title, we wanted both to point to the coming industrialisation of European art education, and to the role of culture in making the social superstructure, in manufacturing society.\r\n\r\nIn shaping our concept one of our main worries was that it could run the risk of simply contributing to the current tendency to see art schools as places that produce students as a product for the market. But is there an alternative to this situation? Is there a social role for art students, for young artists, other than to succeed or fail as producers/products in the culture industry?\r\n\r\nAt Goldsmiths, staff members and artists Susan Kelly and Jesse Ash have form a working group of eleven current and former students of the Joint BA Degree in Fine Art and History of Art taught across the Departments of Art and Visual Cultures. We began discussions about art education as a form of training for the contemporary economy and the particular dilemmas and possibilities that face art students and recent graduates in London today. Students and former students created new work, video documentary, a sound installation, a text installation, a public artwork and a book documenting conversations across 5 Art Academies in Europe. These works were on show at \u0027Manufacturing Today\u0027 exhibition in Trondheim and will continue to inform the future work of the project.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kelly, Susan"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.418713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.379097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.351489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.298943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.276723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85785,"sim:weight":0.268307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.224699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This group which crosses over with its sister group, the \u0027Carrot Workers Collective\u0027, carries out performative investigations, convenes groups of people around a number of key issues, publishes and collaborates with other artists, activists, curators and writers to produce public events, seminars, exhibitions and performances internationally. \r\n\r\nMicropolitics, or the study of power relations at the level of individuals and groups, and related processes of subjectivation, provides an important approach for understanding the connections between art and social change. The term, first developed in the writings of Félix Guattari, Suely Rolnik and Gilles Deleuze in the 1970s, brings together psychoanalysis, politics, and philosophy, and demands a mode of immanent research that does not separate practice-based and theoretical approaches.\r\n\r\nResearching genealogies of micropolitical practices –  such as the Mass Observation Movement of the 1930s ‘anthropologies of themselves’, 1970s feminist and workers inquiries in the factories of Italy, and modes of Participatory Action Research across the third world in the 1950s – the Micropolitics Research Group builds other histories and other possibilities for the relationship between art and politics; opening up new modes of research and art as a space for composing other relationships between the subject, knowledge and social change. In December 2008, The Micropolitics Research Project was cited in Art Forum as one of the most interesting and important cultural developments in London that year.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Micropolitics Research Group and the Carrot Workers Collective has been included in exhibitions, performances and seminars at: \u0027Guattari: No End in Sight\u0027, MACBA Barcelona 2009; \u0027Radical Pedagogy Conference\u0027, Museum of Contemporary Ljubljana 2009; \u0027At Your Service\u0027 exhibition, David Roberts Art Foundation London (2009); Chelsea Space London (2008), Lungomare Gallery Manifesta 7 Counterpoints, Bolzano (2008); Other lectures and symposia including these groups have been held at: \u0027Summit of Non-aligned Initiatives in Education Culture\u0027, Hebbel am Ufer Berlin (2007), and \u0027Disclosures\u0027, Gasworks Gallery London (2008).\r\n\r\nPublic events, gatherings and interviews convened by the Micropolitics Research group ongoing since 2009, include \u0027Militant Research: Studies in Transversality I\u0027 with Colectivo Situaciones and others, Goldsmiths London 2009, lectures with Bifo (Franco Berardi) (Goldsmiths, 2007, and 2010), Suely Rolnik (Goldsmiths, 2008), and the London Cultural Workers Enquiry, walk and mobile seminar with Brian Holmes and Gasworks Gallery, 56a, Rampart and other venues, London, organised and hosted by Micropolitics Research Group, November 2008.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kelly, Susan","Graham, Janna","Graziano, Valeria","Zechner, Manuela","Fererri, Mara","Layton, Jessica","Forkert, Kirsten","Conlin, Peter","Shukaitis, Stevphen"],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.272511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.259779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340778,"sim:weight":0.225283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.206236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929930,"sim:weight":0.179093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.178029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.171845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.168621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The works range from activist documentary, thought-provoking texts in public space, and a proposal for a series of banners which play on the language of political sloganeering. Ressler bridges the gaps between utopian vision and the tactical realities of political, economic, social and cultural change. Carpenter argues for an integrated approach to viewing both the creative and political together, as symmetrical modes of critical engagement, organising and being. By comparing Ressler’s collaborative films and texts, Carpenter reveals a distinct approach to making art which is fully engaged in debates about global economics, and an activism which understands the creative space required for cultural change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carpenter, Ele"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Most approaches to understanding the disenchantment with and drop-out from AS-level mathematics focus on curriculum and assessment. In contrast, this article looks at the role of relationships, taking a psychosocial approach. It draws on data from a three-year qualitative study into why young people choose mathematics. It argues that educational practitioners and policy makers are responding to stories of failure and drop-out by excluding more people from access to mathematics. There is less and less room for difference within our mathematics classrooms. This happens because of the ways that discourses around mathematics fix how we think of the subject, who can learn it and what kind of relationships are possible between learners and mathematics.

In contrast to presenting such transactions as a subordinated public, exchanging meaningless chatter, these communicative acts are seen to be a formalization of language revealing processes, networks, and territories that have positive possibilities for the public engaged in these communications. Using examples such as the act of communication evident in the recent exponential growth of web 2.0 (on-line social networking), the sound of language represented in the murmur of political demonstrations, and the audibility of voices on the underground network, this thesis builds upon and extends discussions that have asserted the political resistance inherent in rumour, gossip, idle talk, and hearsay. This specific analysis focuses upon both our physical, corporeal, and virtual relations to chatter within the developing systems of new technology that transfer the majority of today’s informal exchanges—investigating the sounds, repetitions, occupation of networks, and gestures of communication rather than the exchange of specific content. Using a methodology that acknowledges the ephemeral, transgressive and fluid nature of its subject, this project uses regular first person narrated sections supporting theoretical discussion, refuses the ‘permanence’ of visual illustration, and is directly informed by concerns within my art practice.\r\n\r\nResponding to the ideas inherent to my art practice—concerning the form and presentation of information presented (by the media and political authorities) to the public from which a political cognition is constructed, both text and practice elements of this project focus on an abstract, formal reading of contemporary communication. These abstract experiences of communication and collective action are acknowledged as an integral reading of contemporary politics, and that this sphere should be activated, extended and expanded upon in order to discover the positive possibilities inherent within it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ash, Jesse"],"dc:date":"2010-05-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.703744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.600696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185208,"sim:weight":0.558008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734401,"sim:weight":0.556047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69409,"sim:weight":0.522721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71015,"sim:weight":0.518659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.512816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445509,"sim:weight":0.502359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":941,"sim:weight":0.495675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109077,"sim:weight":0.467946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5004,"sim:weight":0.453054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734362,"sim:weight":0.448746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52001,"sim:weight":0.441623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1347993,"sim:weight":0.433829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446266,"sim:weight":0.43204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70985,"sim:weight":0.427581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70988,"sim:weight":0.427461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106472,"sim:weight":0.417173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1663142,"sim:weight":0.402318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445550,"sim:weight":0.381581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Debord’s\r\nfirst book on the spectacle (1967) was written in the context of France’s post-war\r\nboom; his later reflections, contained in a series of minor works written throughout\r\nthe seventies and eighties, are heavily influenced by Italy’s ‘Years of Lead’ and a\r\nbroader geopolitical climate of armed struggle, terrorism, counter-insurgency and\r\nespionage. Nearly all post-9/11 invocations of Debord’s concept draw on the version\r\nelucidated in Debord’s 1967 book, with its emphasis on commodity fetishism,\r\nideology, and alienation, and fail to engage his later work and its focus on terrorism,\r\nsecrecy, and conspiracy.

However explicit denial of hemiplegia does not necessarily imply a lack of insight of the deficit. In this study we explored explicit and implicit awareness for upper limb motor impairment in a group of 30 right-brain damaged patients. Explicit awareness was assessed using a questionnaire (the VATAm) in which patients are asked to rate their motor abilities, whereas implicit awareness was assessed by means of a newly developed test (BMT - bimanual task). This test requires the performance of a series of bimanual tasks that can be better performed using two hands, but could also be performed using one hand only. With the BMT, patients\u0027 performance rather than their verbal reports is evaluated and scored as an index of awareness. Paretic patients with anosognosia tend to approach these tasks as if they could use both hands. Our findings showed that explicit and implicit awareness for motor deficits can be dissociated, and they may be differently affected by feedback suggesting that different underlying mechanisms may account for the multi-factorial phenomenon of anosognosia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cocchini, Gianna","Beschin, Nicoletta","Fotopoulou, A.","Della Sala, S."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69860,"sim:weight":0.322655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107907,"sim:weight":0.263283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998658,"sim:weight":0.256929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.233222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.179549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109108,"sim:weight":0.157997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.148314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85134,"sim:weight":0.147382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.134135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69993,"sim:weight":0.128085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316186,"sim:weight":0.113091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108924,"sim:weight":0.106594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.0777433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For an exhibition at Ibid Projects in London this past winter, for example, Silver acquired several discarded marble copies of Roman and Greek statuary, recently carved in Carrara, Italy, that had been tossed aside by local artisans because the sculptures were cracked, chipped, or rendered crooked during their making. Whereas the Italian craftspeople had deemed the work too crummy to bother finishing, Silver took these fragments in idiosyncratic directions, pursuing the “failures” further, in fact, and often to antiquarian effect: A limb might be amputated under Silver’s hands, or a semi-polished surface chipped and rendered rougher. In turn, the status of these rejected sculptures, presented by the artist in a gallery exhibition, demanded some reassessment. As Silver’s title for the show, “Making Something Your Own,” implies, these objects were no longer unfinished copies but rather works existing in an ambiguous, liminal zone between quarry reject, antique simulation, and Daniel Silver original.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Gilda"],"dc:date":"2008-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443360,"sim:weight":0.381761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445490,"sim:weight":0.381581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.379945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.333204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.333136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.332911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.288862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.277957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Morris was the founder of the Socialist League and a standard-bearer of Socialism; he maintained a fierce hatred of capitalism and likely would be shocked to see the many money-making projects that his designs have inspired since his death. Today, Morris’ designs have entered the mainstream and become very much a part of the international consumer market.  According to Mabb, “The archive illustrates how Morris’ designs have been appropriated for a mass consumer society. The designs have become widely available at the expense of the qualities and values inherent to Morris’ original utopian project, which offered in its vision of the fecundity of nature the hope of alternative ways of living in the world.” The images are individually laminated in A4 sheets and displayed in 12 blocks of 60 images each.

Individuals with either condition can appear uncaring towards others. This study set out to compare and contrast directly boys with psychopathic tendencies and boys with ASD on tasks assessing aspects of affective empathy and cognitive perspective taking. The main aim of the study was to assess whether a distinct profile of empathy deficits would emerge for boys with psychopathic tendencies and ASD, and whether empathy deficits would be associated with conduct problems in general, rather than psychopathic tendencies or ASD specifically.\r\n\r\nMethods: Four groups of boys aged between 9 and 16 years (N \u003d 96) were compared: 1) psychopathic tendencies, 2) ASD, 3) conduct problems and 4) comparison. Tasks were included to probe attribution of emotions to self, empathy for victims of aggression and cognitive perspective-taking ability. \r\n\r\nResults: Boys with psychopathic tendencies had a profile consistent with dysfunctional affective empathy. They reported experiencing less fear and less empathy for victims of aggression than comparison boys. Their cognitive perspective-taking abilities were not statistically significantly different from those of comparison boys. In contrast, boys with ASD had difficulties with tasks requiring cognitive perspective taking, but reported emotional experiences and victim empathy that were in line with comparison boys. Boys with conduct problems did not differ from comparison boys, suggesting that the affective empathy deficit seen in boys with psychopathic tendencies was specific to that group, rather than common to all boys with conduct problems. \r\n\r\nConclusions: Although both groups can appear uncaring, our findings suggest that the affective/information processing correlates of psychopathic tendencies and ASD are quite different. Psychopathic tendencies are associated with difficulties in resonating with other people\u0027s distress, whereas ASD is characterised by difficulties in knowing what other people think.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Alice P.","Happe, Francesca","Gilbert, Francesca","Burnett, Stephanie","Viding, Essi"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15398,"sim:weight":0.2456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.225136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15399,"sim:weight":0.187185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66187,"sim:weight":0.152364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.136924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23493,"sim:weight":0.129796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266928,"sim:weight":0.124605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108668,"sim:weight":0.109087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316186,"sim:weight":0.105933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.101536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.0929304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Emerging research suggests that a subgroup of children with conduct problems and elevated levels of callous-unemotional traits may be genetically vulnerable to manifesting disturbances in neural reactivity to emotional stimuli indexing distress. Using functional MRI, the authors evaluated differences in neural response to emotional stimuli between boys with conduct problems and elevated levels of callous-unemotional traits and comparison boys. METHOD: Seventeen boys with conduct problems and elevated levels of callous-unemotional traits and 13 comparison boys of equivalent age (mean\u003d11 years) and IQ (mean\u003d100) viewed blocked presentations of fearful and neutral faces. For each face, participants distinguished the sex of the face via manual response. RESULTS: Relative to the comparison group, boys with conduct problems and elevated levels of callous-unemotional traits manifested lesser right amygdala activity to fearful faces. CONCLUSIONS: This finding is in line with data from studies of adults with antisocial behavior and callous-unemotional traits (i.e., psychopaths), as well as from a recent study of adolescents with callous-unemotional traits, and suggests that the neural substrates of emotional impairment associated with callous-unemotional antisocial behavior are already present in childhood.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Alice P.","Laurens, Kristin R.","Herba, Catherine M.","Barker, Gareth J.","Viding, Essi"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Ranging in\r\nher novels from staunch support of the squatterarchy to sentimental sympathy\r\nfor the common man, her political instincts were basically paternalist and\r\nlandlordist, but for all the general conservatism she was typically understood\r\nas an independent spirit, a straight talker unafraid of challenging convention\r\nespecially where her sense of justice was at stake. In the 1980s when a small\r\nselection from her prodigious output was reprinted in the Pandora Australian\r\nWomen Writers series, the idea of Praed as a prototype feminist and a\r\nchampion of black causes was strongly mooted. Pam Gilbert’s introduction\r\nto Lady Bridget in Th e Never-Never Land (1915), for example, claimed that\r\nthe chief protagonists of that novel were ‘women who think, argue, make\r\ndecisions for themselves, value independence and acquire it’ (vii). Dale\r\nSpender’s introduction to Outlaw and Lawmaker (1893) similarly saw Praed\r\nexploring ‘some of the injustices of the world’ (xi). In her brief biographical\r\naccount in A Bright and Fiery Troop, Spender gave this exploration a specific\r\nracial dimension: ‘Years before it became acceptable to appreciate the culture\r\nof these persecuted people [the Aborigines]’, she wrote, ‘Rosa Praed was not\r\nonly including them as characters in her novels but was eloquently pleading\r\ntheir case for justice and dignity’ (202).","bibo:AuthorList":["Platt, Len"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108988,"sim:weight":0.341443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.328599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.317039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.303248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108714,"sim:weight":0.261727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":315976,"sim:weight":0.255268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.25101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.230226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108411,"sim:weight":0.214716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The production companies responsible for reproducing ‘classic novels’ have been attracted not just by the ready-made plots and characters, but also, perhaps especially in British film and television,  by the status of canonical texts that have a virtually unassailable currency in terms of cultural value. Indeed these two elements are inseparable, with the ‘filmability’ of the classic novel being shaped and determined by its high status in cultural terms. As the cultural form par excellence of the educated classes, the novel gives filmmakers not just a stock of stories and memorable heroes and villains, but also a direct line to prestige. It is not surprising that the adaptation of the novel to film has been seen as playing a considerable part in establishing the reputation of mainstream film as a serious and important ‘popular’ culture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Platt, Len","Davin, Solange","Jackson, Rhona"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In this case, the term ‘transactional’ refers to the initial material motivation behind their interactions. While the majority of women are employed as bartenders or waitresses in tourist areas of Phnom Penh, outside observers tend to erroneously label them as ‘prostitutes’ or ‘broken women’ because of the gift-based nature of the intimate exchanges. Ethnographic evidence demonstrates, however, that they make up a diverse and nuanced group of individuals who engage in relationships more complex than simply ‘sex-for-cash’ exchanges, and often seek marriage and love in addition to material comforts. Though they do not view themselves as ‘prostitutes’, the distinction of the term ‘professional’ is used to emphasize that 1) they do rely on the formation of these relationships as a means of livelihood and their motivations are initially materially-based; 2) they engage in multiple overlapping transactional relationships, usually unbeknownst to their other partners; 3) there is a performance of intimacy, whereby the professed feelings of love and dedication lie somewhere on a continuum between genuine and feigned, and where the term ‘love’ itself carries multiple meanings.\r\n\r\nThe research further reveals not only the stereotypes, contradictions, and structural constraints experienced by these young women, but also their entrepreneurialism, determination and creativity. Despite trauma related to recent political past, sexual violence, stigma, depression and self-harming, they use tools of global feminine youth culture, consumption, linguistic ability, ‘bar girl’ subculture, and interpersonal relationships to make socioeconomic advancements and find enjoyment in their lives. The practice of \u0027intimate ethnography\u0027 also illuminates the negotiation of intimacy and friendship between the participants and researcher, as well as the general materiality and exchange of everyday sex and relationships around the globe.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hoefinger, Heidi"],"dc:date":"2010-06-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.279235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654995,"sim:weight":0.256348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53847,"sim:weight":0.25573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652016,"sim:weight":0.253408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.247674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.233424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.220989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.207751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.204875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Whereas the emergence and prevalence of a sense of companionship and collective identity is less surprising in tightly-woven collectivities that frequently gather in public venues in a particular locality, it demands more of an explanation in spatially dispersed musical worlds, like the transnational crate digging scene, in which regular, locally based face-to-face interaction takes place in small friendly circles that consist of a handful of enthusiasts at most.\r\n\r\nThe thesis reworks earlier, more elusive definitions of the notion of scene – a shared cultural space in which a range of coexisting and interacting musical practices work towards producing a sense of community – in a way that is more specific both with regarding what kinds of practices – aesthetic, distinctive, and spatial – shall be taken into consideration in accounting for the sources of attachments in musical collectivities. Furthermore, through its empirical chapters it outlines and connects particular areas of inquiry – the collective cultivation of a certain form of musical appreciation, the performance of distinctive practices, the acquisition and passing on of scenic sensibilities and customs, the places of scenic practice, as well as a shared understanding of spatiality – in which the productive ―work of these practices could be be more closely observed and understood.\r\n\r\nThrough a micro-sociological study of the collective practices organised around the consumption of second hand records, the thesis also engages with the sociocultural significance of the transforming technological regime of music consumption.","bibo:AuthorList":["Valyi, Gabor"],"dc:date":"2010-06-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Bush warned his audience of an ‘axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world’. It is tempting to roll one’s eyes in contemptuous disbelief at this now familiar refrain. Yet, however we may react to Bush’s terminology, it is certain that we cannot help but react. That phrase, of course, was calculated precisely to have an immediate, practical effect by dividing the world and forcing us to take sides. For few notions have the visceral, rhetorical power of the term ‘evil’. Even when we oppose its use, we often react with the very gut-instinct such notions are designed to activate. Whilst, on occasion, philosophers accuse each other of ‘category errors’, perhaps even of some disgraceful ‘performative contradiction’, these complaints barely come close to the sheer normative force of vocabularies that invoke religious terms.\r\n\r\nIt might be assumed, then, that a serious, emancipatory politics cannot deal in such charged concepts without collapsing into a potentially barbarous mysticism. Surely the language of evil lends itself too easily to the apocalyptic visions of reactionary conservativism to be of value for those with progressive goals? Yet William E. Connolly is one of a number of contemporary political philosophers who has looked to the vocabulary of religion and, indeed, to the term evil in order to explore the possibilities for a radical, democratic politics. How he does this and how we might respond to the challenge to think pluralism in relation to evil are the focus of this chapter.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martin, James"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66047,"sim:weight":0.254941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.251428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109107,"sim:weight":0.246451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.23483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.232314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108987,"sim:weight":0.224465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.216977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.214299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86060,"sim:weight":0.201092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108800,"sim:weight":0.194923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109087,"sim:weight":0.188439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1444841,"sim:weight":0.18023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86055,"sim:weight":0.172926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.153969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In interwar Yugoslavia non-Serbs had been subjected to Serb domination; not just Croats and Slovenes, but also, and especially, Macedonians (officially regarded as ‘Southern Serbs’), ethnic Albanians and even Montenegrins, most of whom, regardless of their political affiliation, viewed themselves as members of a wider Serbian nation.  This chapter does not attempt to argue otherwise. Instead, it suggests that divisions also existed within ethnic groups and that there were Serbs who opposed the government and non-Serbs who participated in it.

The Serbian Kosovo Myth Revisited","bibo:abstract":"During the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s some authors sought to explain the Serbian-instigated violence by a nationalist mythology at the centre of which lies the myth of Kosovo.  According to this argument, the genocide committed by Serbian forces was not caused by ‘the pathology of the individual organizing and committing the genocide, but the pathology of the ideas guiding them’.  In this article, I argue that history of the Kosovo myth does not offer a straightforward narrative that links the Serbia of 1389 with events of the last two decades in former Yugoslavia. Myths, like nations, have their own history – history that is seldom linear and predetermined – and are an essential ingredient of nation-building.  Just as it may be argued that the process of nation-building is never fully completed, so national myths evolve and gain new interpretations over time. \r\n\r\nThe analysis concentrates on the last two centuries, during which modern nationalist ideologies emerged and developed. In particular, I address the following three issues: a) the significance of the Kosovo myth during the emergence of modern Serbian national ideology in the nineteenth century; b) the Kosovo myth as a pan-Yugoslav myth; and c) the use of the Kosovo myth by the West.","bibo:AuthorList":["Djokic, Dejan","Bak, Janos M.","Jarnut, Jörg","Monnet, Pierre","Schneidmueller, Bernd"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6615,"sim:weight":0.686925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109149,"sim:weight":0.262003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108955,"sim:weight":0.23264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":1445655,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Staging Ecologies: The Politics of Theatricality and the Production of Global Ecological Subjectivities","bibo:abstract":"Since the latter decades of the twentieth century, environmental threats posed by global industrialization have become a matter of growing public concern. Increasingly grievances are aired in the streets around the world, and are broadcast in the popular media. However, with the prominence of techno-scientific and ecomanagerial approaches to the ‘ecological crisis’ ecological discourse may be in the process of becoming the new rubric of global governance. Here I engage debates concerning biopolitics and the production of subjectivity, in order to assess the implications of the theatricality of interventions for recasting the terms according to which ecological problematics are approached. I pursue this question: How can theatrics intervene in shaping the political ecology of the future? \r\n\r\nI begin this thesis by presenting a theory of the politics of theatricality as it applies to the development and reshaping of global ecological politics. In the subsequent chapters, I develop this theory in light of the uses of theatricality in the World Urban Festival, an ‘arts-for-social-change’ festival on the theme of ‘sustainability’ held in Vancouver; an environmental health education program launched in Ecuador with international support; and within local and international activist movements in the aftermath of the Bhopal Gas Leak, widely considered to be the worst industrial disaster of the twentieth century. \r\n\r\nI argue that while the theatricality of such interventions can promote a particular ecological ethic that minimizes the politics at stake, theatrical interventions can also challenge the de-politicized naturalization of ecological problems. I conclude that the context and nature of relationships staged in and through each event shapes the politics of theatricality, and in turn, the production of global ecological subjectivities. As such, I identify the various challenges and opportunities signalled by this trend toward staging ecologies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spiegel, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2010-12-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.575609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.575609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.567978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.562142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.55045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.543903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631555,"sim:weight":0.494908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.48413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768956,"sim:weight":0.47185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109077,"sim:weight":0.461583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":697362,"sim:weight":0.359601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223666,"sim:weight":0.343461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9045871,"sim:weight":0.327051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1526,"sim:weight":0.25951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9046783,"sim:weight":0.243412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":123464,"sim:weight":0.231931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68792,"sim:weight":0.219692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109436,"sim:weight":0.208424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9321370,"sim:weight":0.203656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543354,"sim:weight":0.1925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Each of these landmark events has provided an impetus to rethink education policy and practice.\r\nThe groundbreaking work of Sir Ken Robinson in All Our Futures (i) made significant reference to the work of Howard Gardner with his classification of diverse intelligences. All our Futures is now just over ten years old however it is only now just beginning to have significant impact, it is essentially concerned with creative education – both learning and teaching creatively but also crucially recognising how to develop creative talent in students of all ages. On one level this has provoked a significant debate ( in a number of countries) on curriculum content; on one side an emphasis focusing on traditional mathematical and literacy skills the other on creative abilities developed around the Gardner intelligences, linguistic, mathematical, spatial, kinaesthetic, musical, interpersonal and intrapersonal. It is now necessary to move on from this debate ( although many countries have yet to fully understand or adopt the principals) to consider how the space in which creativity (ii) can flourish and be respected in all educational disciplines, can be can itself be created. This is essentially the teaching of entrepreneurial thinking ‘entrepreneurship education is a process which develops individuals’ mindsets, behaviours, skills and capabilities and can be applied to create value’ (iii) in a range of contexts and environments ( please note that this should not be confused with ‘enterprise’ - business thinking ). To return to Gardner, he now suggests five overarching qualities of mind for the 21st century. An expertise in a discipline, an ability to synthesize information and communicate it, the creating mind, an engagement with and a respect for diversity and finally to be able to act ethically.  If these qualities or capacities (which sound very reasonable) are to be learnt effectively then they will need to be developed through a cultural lens. The ‘culture’ referred to is increasingly global in nature as it is often engaged with through digital means. The digital expert Jaron Lanier points out a key concern with culture in this form. The difference between real culture and fake culture is whether you internalise the thing before you mash (iv) it. Does it become part of you? Is there some way your meaning, your spirit, your understanding has touched this thing? Or is it just a touch of novelty for a moment to get some attention? Culture involves some work, some risk, some exploration, some surprise (v).\r\nThis paper will deal with the issues generated by learning entrepreneurial (self determining) skills and future qualities of ‘mind’ within the context of a global culture.\r\ni KACES has translated the Ken Robinson book Out of Our Minds into Korean and the ideas therein are being disseminated.\r\nii It is understood that creativity can not be taught but the conditions for its development can be put in place.\r\niii Developing Entrepreneurial Graduates Putting Entrepreneurship at the centre of higher education Durham University 2009\r\niv A Mash (up) is a term in web development referring to an application or web page that puts together data or a function from different sources to create a new page or function.\r\nv Jaron Lanier, author of \u0027You Are Not A Gadget\u0027 interviewed in the Observer Newspaper London 21/02/2010\r\n\r\nUnesco \u0026 the Government of the Republic of Korea\r\nWorld Conference on Arts Education\r\nSeoul 25-28 May 2010\r\nIdentification form for the submission of abstracts on Arts Education\r\n(research/case studies/experiences of best practices)\r\nSurname: Lidstone\r\nName: Gerald\r\nMr/Ms/Dr/Prof: Dr\r\nPast and present occupation (detailed description):\r\n2008 - Director Institute of Creative and Cultural Entrepreneurship ICCE\r\n2004 -2008 HOD Drama Department\r\n1985 -2004 University Lecturer\r\nOrganization/Institution/University:\r\nGoldsmiths University of London\r\nAddress:\r\nICCE 114 Whitehead, Goldsmiths, Lewisham Way New Cross, London SE14 6NW UK\r\nTelephone (+international code):\r\n+44 (0) 207 919 7424\r\nFax (+international code):\r\n+44 (0) 207 919 7413\r\nE-mail Address:\r\ng.lidstone@gold.ac.uk\r\nTitle of the Paper:\r\nThe policy and practice of learning entrepreneurial skills and future qualities of \u0027mind\u0027","bibo:AuthorList":["Lidstone, Gerald N."],"dc:date":"2010-05-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research addresses the problem of documentation of transient contemporary art practices, by collecting and analysing ephemera and developing a resource based upon them. Art ephemera are by-products of institutions, galleries, exhibitions, and curatorialactivities that may be significant in terms of criticality but which are often not recorded adequately and remain un-archived. The strategies of representation that ephemera mobilise take place at an interface of art aims and social structures, an area that has been a vital site of contemporary practice. I review major issues in contemporary criticism of the ‘avant-garde’ and ‘alternative’,showing the discourse of the alternative to be an ethical discourse about practice. Identifying citation as means of interpretation, I draw my account from a reading ofephemera in the chapters: “Citation, marginalia, mockery, fakes and tailpieces” where I identify visual and textual qualities of ephemera, “Artists, spaces and institutions,”where I present the themes of mapping London and self-institutionalisation, and “Counter to ?” where I report a distancing from counter-cultural aims and development of complex alternatives.\r\n\r\nI evaluate existing collections of art ephemera in libraries, projects to facilitate access to them, and cataloguing and collecting policies. I advocate use of catalogues to recontextualise ephemera. In conclusion, I present a complex notion of ‘alternative space’ in art practice as a space for dialogue with, rather than opposition to established institutions and circuits of contemporary art and I endorse collection of ephemera as a source for diverse histories.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cooke, Jacqueline"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2769041,"sim:weight":0.236598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447922,"sim:weight":0.140047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This volume examines a key aspect of this understanding, the notion of ‘citizenship’ as it is being defined in Eastern Europe today. Formally, ‘citizenship’ refers to the criteria of membership in a political community. More broadly, it raises key questions of identity, contract and culture, which bear upon the future of such issues as human rights, mobility and the relations between state and civil society in the post-communist world.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary collection brings together sociologists, jurists and political theorists from Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic as well as from Switzerland, France, Great Britain and the United States. The volume seeks to articulate and compare the meanings and implications of ‘citizenship’ in terms of key issues and in several national contexts. Common to all contributions is the conviction that a comparison among different understandings of citizenship illuminates national specifications and brings into focus some of the constraints on the emergence of a democratic consensus shared by East and West.","bibo:AuthorList":["Liebich, Andre","Warner, Daniel","Dragovic-Soso, Jasna","Liebich, Andre","Warner, Daniel","Dragovic-Soso, Jasna"],"dc:date":"1995","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.267432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":658880,"sim:weight":0.246636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108067,"sim:weight":0.222942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929824,"sim:weight":0.205978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104012,"sim:weight":0.181076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using Hatano’s concept of Adaptive Expertise as\r\nits theoretical perspective, the curriculum is analysed from the point of view of how well it is likely to prepare children for a life in which the ability to evaluate information will become a generically crucial skill needing to be applied in many varied and unforeseeable circumstances.

I implemented and managed the Healthy Schools initiative. At the time I struggled to find a tangible definition of ECM and what form it could take in a school setting. Now, working with students, training to become professional educators I introduce ECM as a framework. It enables individuals within an educational setting to start to share ideas that are context specific and relate directly to those it affects.

An ethnographic study conducted during the author’s employment as a Pupil Support Officer within secondary schools and the children’s services department of an urban local authority in England explores the idea that professionals may be forced to make inequitable decisions about including or excluding pupils in the face of powerful competition between the politically unchallengeable concepts of tolerance, inclusivity, attainment, and choice. The article argues that the tensions of multi-agency working are focused within what will be described as the contested space of the young person’s ‘extended body’. However, whilst the contested nature of this space renders it vulnerable to negative description and to the biased judgements of authoritarian power, it also offers itself as a space for emancipatory self description by the young person and for the expression of agency on the part of those professionals working for social justice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carlile, Anna"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":10376,"sim:weight":0.304908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.286752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.270328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.267676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316190,"sim:weight":0.253929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":294473,"sim:weight":0.250752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.246114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.225496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.220525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.189198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It seems inconsequential; the culture industry is not much more than a distraction; a fairytale diversion to make us forget a more sinister amnesia behind the stories we tell. This article nonetheless takes up debates about cultural expression in the field of diasporic musics in Britain. It examines instances of creative engagement with, and destabilization of, music genres by Fundamental and Asian Dub Foundation, and it takes a broadly culture critique perspective on diasporic creativity as a guide to thinking about the politics of hip-hop in a time of war. Examples from music industry and media reportage of the work of these two bands pose both political provocation and a challenge to the seemingly unruffled facade of British civil society, particularly insofar as musical work might still be relevant to struggles around race and war. Here, at a time of what conservative critics call a ‘clash of civilizations’, I examine how music and authenticity become the core parameters for a limited and largely one-sided argument that seems to side-step political context in favour of sensationalized—entrenched—identities and a mythic, perhaps unworkable, ideal of cultural harmony that praises the most asinine versions of multiculturalism while demonizing those most able to bring it about. Here the idea that musical cultures are variously authentic, possessive or coherent must be questioned when issues of death and destruction are central, but ignored.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hutnyk, John"],"dc:date":"2007-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Once purely a military phrase used to distinguish crack troops, it then assumed a high-ranking position within cultural expression, marking out art work that forged ahead and broke new ground. What can it mean to conjoin this French phrase with the word “Arab”? French forces, along with other imperial intruders, are no strangers to Arab terrain. The colonisation of Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Greater Syria followed in the wake of the brief Napoleonic “mission” to Egypt between 1798 and 1801. It was during this military foray that some of modern Europe’s most expansive data on Egyptian music was collected, information that comprised two whole volumes of Guillaume André Villoteau’s Description de l’Egypte.

The paper sits within a theoretical framework in which I understand individual and collective masculinities and femininities as ways of ‘doing man/woman’ or ‘doing boy/girl’ that are constructed within local communities of masculinity and femininity practice. Empirical data come from a one-year study of tomboy identities within two London primary schools. The paper explores the contrasting identities of tomboy and girly-girl, how they are constructed by the children, and how this changes as they approach puberty. The findings suggest that the oppositional construction of these identities makes it harder for girls to take up more flexible femininities, though it is possible to switch between tomboy and girly-girl identities at different times and places.","bibo:AuthorList":["Paechter, Carrie F."],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The first concerns the issues and difficulties involved in studying how children think about their bodies, in the schooling setting. The second involves an attempt to bring together a series of phenomena around which gendered media and social panics are being constructed in the UK and elsewhere. \r\nI discuss the problems concerned with the practicalities of studying children’s bodies in a setting in which the body is effaced. I argue that the problems arising from this effacement are compounded by children’s embarrassment about their bodies, particularly in a situation in which bodies are supposed to be invisible. Related to this, I argue that children’s and young people’s bodies that are made visible in schools and other public or semi-public arenas are rendered pathological by that very visibility. I suggest that we can see all these metaphorically pathological bodies in terms of a failure of or resistance to the disciplinary institutions of the school and the family, and that such an understanding of ‘problematic’ bodies can help us to see what they have in common. I conclude with suggestions for future research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Paechter, Carrie F."],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109179,"sim:weight":0.519511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.505295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.50306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.488147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.482068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85193,"sim:weight":0.477418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53847,"sim:weight":0.454032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445292,"sim:weight":0.449942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.440092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.411048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.405156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.391777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.379774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.379774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53655,"sim:weight":0.360668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While there is excellent work exploring many of these points of contact, there is also a tendency for social science to treat design as a topic (e.g. what does design do and how might this be accounted for in sociological terms?), and for design to treat social science as a resource (e.g. what useful knowledge does sociology produce and how can this be deployed to model users or construct scenarios?).\r\nThis day conference aims to contribute to the move beyond this pattern. Collecting a group of leading practitioners in design and social science, the conference will present a series of dialogues and commentaries on a range of common, open issues. Specifically, the format runs like this: invited speakers\r\n(Harvey, Michelle, Pelle and Bill) will speak for around 25 minutes; there will then be a short response/reflection/ discussion from a local colleague (please see below), then 20 minutes open discussion. Each titled session is not rigidly defined, rather the topics are simply prompts to further thought, for instance: how might the practices of speculative or critical designers furnish social science with new insights into the study and articulation of society? How might social science’s interest in complexity contribute to the iterative process of making in design? In what ways might these fit together or articulate? In the final session, Lucy will make provide some general observations and comments and there will be a final open discussion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilkie, Alex","Kerridge, Tobie","Michael, Mike","Gaver, William","Wakeford, Nina","Jungnickel, Kat"],"dc:date":"2010-09-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1446439,"sim:weight":0.430207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999286,"sim:weight":0.348508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The temptation to try to extrapolate Marlowe\u0027s artistic intentions not only from the text of his plays and poems, but from the little that is known about his dramatic career, continues to lead those who write about his life down blind alleys. This tendency to make use of what I like to describe as the ‘must-have’ theory of biography, according to which Marlowe must have thought this or must have known that, is widespread. A few years ago, I attempted to demonstrate how little we know for certain about Marlowe\u0027s life. Since the publication of Constructing Christopher Marlowe in 2000, however, several further attempts to explain what happened in the weeks leading up to Marlowe\u0027s death in Deptford on 30 May 1593 have been published. While M. J. Trow and Taliesin Trow suggest that he was simply the victim of an Elizabethan contract killing,  David Riggs insists that Elizabeth I personally gave the order for Marlowe to be murdered.4 In the ‘Revised Edition’ of his conspiracy thesis, The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe, Charles Nicholl follows Professor Riggs in suspecting government complicity in Marlowe\u0027s death.","bibo:AuthorList":["Downie, Alan (J.

I elaborate key elements of Derrida’s increasingly glossed essay \"The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)\" to show both their commonality with deconstruction more broadly and their conceptual importance in rethinking relations between humans and other animals in particular. These elements are not simply applied to Haraway, Cixous, and Schneemann but are interwoven with and developed by their works. I position the interspecies kiss, indeed the kiss in general, as performative. While \"performativity\" has become part of the lexicon of Visual Culture, often appearing simply in adjectival form, its more complex articulation in the work of Derrida is often overlooked. There the term, as part of his subtle displacement of signification, already impacts on what we thought was human property: rather than meaning residing in our organic, present possession, it becomes conditioned by a machinic, reactive repetition, the very quality that Descartes attempted to section off as the impoverished domain of the animal. Bringing organic and machinic into an enmeshed relation inevitably brings Haraway’s figure of the cyborg to mind, while the \"doing\" over \"being\" quality of the performative resonates with her emphasis on the relating of our encounters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, Lynn"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1445668,"sim:weight":0.151219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445024,"sim:weight":0.147352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445555,"sim:weight":0.143389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443310,"sim:weight":0.141013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1444511,"sim:weight":0.133597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445338,"sim:weight":0.132172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445304,"sim:weight":0.121853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1444245,"sim:weight":0.116296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445356,"sim:weight":0.109989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445330,"sim:weight":0.10024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443447,"sim:weight":0.0888328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445337,"sim:weight":0.0816301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443359,"sim:weight":0.0644872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443353,"sim:weight":0.0636515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443356,"sim:weight":0.0632705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443411,"sim:weight":0.062883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443358,"sim:weight":0.0622372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443346,"sim:weight":0.061474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is argued that the artworks become sites in which the assumptions of transition are opened up for critical reflection, requesting attention to the foreclosing of the meanings of memory, of past-and-future, of community.  A mode of critical questioning of the present renders the present problematic not in terms of exclusions nor with reference to a past that cannot or will not be erased, but in terms of the present’s inability to be conceived through a linear conception of time.  That is, the past and its relation to both the present and to the future are set in oscillation as artworks explore the complex temporalities of a present self-consciously attempting to narrate itself away from the past.  The artworks, ‘without the bigotry of conviction’ as Seamus Deane put it, suggest that the task of dealing with the past is flawed wherever the past is conceived as a history that can be rendered present to be judged by subjects who are thereby placed beyond it.  That is the illusion of a present ‘no-time’ that dovetails with the desires of commercial enterprise and neo-liberal conceptions of freedom.  If this suggests an unceasing restlessness, the consolation is that this questioning does take a form, not as judgement or political decision but as artworks which by definition, remain open to reinterpretation and new understandings.  These issues are discussed with reference to the work of four artists in Northern Ireland: the paintings of Rita Duffy, the photography and installation work of Anthony Haughey, and the sculptural works of Philip Napier and Mike Hogg.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bell, Vikki"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Fairness in life chances is taken to be the primary objective. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this collection of essays is to deepen political understanding of the barriers to further social mobility and to the realising of personal aspiration, particularly among the most disadvantaged sections of society, and to identify further steps that the government can take to overcome these barriers, through clear, incisive analysis from leading experts in the field.","bibo:AuthorList":["Griffiths, Simon"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.623923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341217,"sim:weight":0.602034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.582583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.582583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8791830,"sim:weight":0.562515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309483,"sim:weight":0.558408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":222079,"sim:weight":0.527994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75732,"sim:weight":0.512248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929875,"sim:weight":0.509567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360742,"sim:weight":0.501073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.497915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.495745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86241,"sim:weight":0.495581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108999,"sim:weight":0.491398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93631,"sim:weight":0.484708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8791807,"sim:weight":0.482384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112506,"sim:weight":0.478429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":221549,"sim:weight":0.468165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17181,"sim:weight":0.451055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8791793,"sim:weight":0.450051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Human rights activists imagine practical deconstruction of the distinction between citizens and noncitizens through which national states have been constituted. They envisage a world order of cosmopolitan states in which the rights of all would be fully respected. How likely is it that such a form of society might be realised through their activities? Is collective responsibility for human rights currently being shaped in cultural politics? If so, how, and with what consequences?

Through the example of the hacking scandal, the paper discusses how the cosmopolitan ethics of  the ‘freedom of the press’ have become distorted by a thoroughly commercialized tabloid media, to mean little more than freedom of the market to do as it pleases. This is presented as a form of cosmopolitan capitalism via a communication system that is part of a global economy and one that requires new communication policies in order to preserve and promote democratic values over consumerist ones.  The paper then turns to an entirely different form of communications online that seek to establish cosmopolitan solidarity via forms of political democracy that rest on the principle of contestation. The paper suggests that cosmopolitanism invites universalist assumptions that at once deny the particularities of time and space while also being susceptible to the particular hegemonic order of the day and the balances of power in any given context. It is, therefore, always both conformist and contestatory, universal and particular. However, it is through contestation that cosmopolitanism can truly flourish.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fenton, Natalie"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929897,"sim:weight":0.259496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.252553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.241605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.221294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":1445924,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Measurement as Reflection in Faith Based Social Action","bibo:abstract":"The role of faith-based groups in social action in communities has been demonstrated in a significant body of regional publications aimed at community audiences. A systematic review of this literature (Dinham 2007) shows the considerable extent to which faith groups are engaged in social action in communities across England. It also identifies the diversity of language used to describe those activities and research approaches to capturing it. This article examines how this diversity poses challenges to demonstrating the value of faith- based activities to funders who support them and to policy makers who construct the contexts in which they work. It also notes the difficulties posed to discussing and comparing faith based activities in ways which might be helpful to faith groups’ own constructive reflective practice and to the learning they could share with each other and contribute to the wider voluntary and community sector. It considers this in the context of how power accrues around what is measured and therefore valued and recognised. It goes on to reflect upon a process of developing a measurement approach which has been ongoing since summer 2008, examining the problems and challenges involved. A starting point is that faith based social action in communities is both highly valuable and yet currently difficult to measure. We discuss the possibility of moving towards such measureability by rooting it in community development approaches and values. The aim is to balance the demands of accountability and demonstrability with the values of community development, to produce a ‘bottom up’ reflective praxis which can support and empower local faith communities to be heard on their own terms whilst at the same time defining and refining those terms. In these ways, it is intended both for practitioners engaging in faith-based social action and its evaluation, and for policy-makers and funders wishing to engage with its value and contribution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dinham, Adam","Shaw, Marth"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":261048,"sim:weight":0.419579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108053,"sim:weight":0.345985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.300704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.293903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.269176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first is the beginning of Banti’s Artemisia (1947): it is 1944 and the narrator – a projection of Banti herself – is sitting in her nightgown on the ground in the Giardino de’ Boboli, in Florence, where she has taken refuge having escaped the destruction of her home; she hears a voice: ‘non piangere,’ ‘don’t cry.’ The Allied troops were entering Florence, the German army were leaving, blowing up bridges before abandoning the town, and the narrator’s home, her possessions, her nearly completed manuscript of Artemisia Gentileschi were lost under the rubble. The voice that chides and comforts her is Artemisia’s, a painter from three centuries earlier who was raped as a young woman, denounced her rapist in a trial, had to undergo torture to prove that she was telling the truth, was subjected to the humiliation of a gynaecological examination in the court to prove that she had lost her virginity to the rapist, and who went on to become a famous painter, controversial and defiant in her life, sought after by patrons and pupils.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boldrini, Lucia"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The Theosophical Movement provided a literary, artistic and intellectual centre from which radiated influences whose effect was felt even by those that did not belong to it.\"\r\n\r\nYeats, George Russell, and John Eglinton, all key figures in the Irish Literary Revival, joined the Society at various times. Both Russell and Yeats knew Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky personally, and both were deeply influenced by her. For seven years, Russell remained a member of the “Household,” a group of theosophists who lived together and formed the nucleus staff of The Irish Theosophist begun in 1892. This influential journal remained in publication until 1897 when it was replaced by The Internationalist, for which Eglinton wrote a great deal. Thereafter, the Irish theosophy movement, in parallel with the wider international organization, went through a number of breaks and schisms. Russell in particular, despite the upheavals, remained committed and active, especially in the later years as head of the Hermetic Society, until he left Ireland in 1933, just two years before his death.","bibo:AuthorList":["Platt, Len"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929875,"sim:weight":0.384337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108887,"sim:weight":0.383501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108250,"sim:weight":0.377029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108592,"sim:weight":0.341472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109016,"sim:weight":0.279817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734362,"sim:weight":0.242216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.215659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.207885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.188403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108601,"sim:weight":0.186392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108273,"sim:weight":0.183321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29421,"sim:weight":0.168761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.166118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":315976,"sim:weight":0.165504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108411,"sim:weight":0.158323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108800,"sim:weight":0.152317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

David Maclagan (2005) argues for the importance of ‘imagination’ in art therapy, and David Mann (2006) responds by defending a Freudian view of art therapy which he feels Maclagan has unfairly attacked on the grounds of it suppressing imagination.  The view of this paper is that the arguments in both papers perpetuate the split in art therapy between an emphasis either on the art in art therapy or the therapy in art therapy, and in both cases this is because the authors neglect the significance of embodiment. An acceptance of ourselves as physical beings brings with it an awareness of context and of gender and therefore of political relations. The two papers are deconstructed to reveal that the suppression of the perceptual results in a perpetuation of the crystallisation of imagination rather than the releasing of it, which the authors are intending. The feminist philosopher and psychoanalyst Luce Irigaray’s writings are used to propose a new way in which we might think about the relationship between art and talk in art therapy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skaife, S.E"],"dc:date":"2008-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108987,"sim:weight":0.175706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.165059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.157299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The transference and counter transference relation between client and psychotherapist is described as a process of territorialization and deterritorialization in which a dream of the client led to the production of art works by the psychotherapist. This at work led to the production of imagery based around the therapeutic relationship involving key images of wild animals. The animal imagery is linked to Deleuze and Guattari\u0027s re-interpretation of Freud’s interpretation of the Wolfman dream, emphasizing the social and historical determinants of dream imagery. The interrelationships between Wilderness, Territorialization and the personal and the political in dream imagery suggest the psychotherapeutic space as located on the borders between the social and a wild or wilderness space.

This is reflected in the United Kingdom in a public policy interest in faiths as repositories of resources for ‘strengthened community’. Thus faiths are understood as ‘containers’ of staff, buildings, volunteers, networks, values and skills which can be ‘harnessed’ in key community domains, especially the provision of welfare and social services, extended forms of participative neighbourhood governance, and initiatives for community cohesion. Resources in each of these areas are understood to reside in ‘faith communities’ and faiths are frequently seen as ‘good at community’ in these terms. But do we know what a ‘faith community’ is?

Parental views of inclusive place- ments are consistently more positive where there is an ASD resource base in the school. This study was designed to investigate characteristics of the provision available to pupils with ASD in main- stream schools with and without a specialist ASD resource base. Information was gathered from semi-structured interviews with staff in 26 schools about levels of inclusion and support, about the strategies used to support pupils with ASD, both at an individual and whole school level, and about changes considered desirable. Interviewees were also asked to describe how they would respond to scenarios depicting situations that are commonly experienced in working with pupils who have ASD. Findings confirmed that the features of main- stream placements identified as important by parents of children with ASD were more likely to be found in schools with ASD resource bases. However, it was found that comparable provision could be made across settings given appropriate staff training. Scope for further development across settings was also identified, particularly in the use of evidence-based peer-mediated strategies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Frederickson, Norah","Jones, Alice P.","Lang, Jane"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.308748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23462,"sim:weight":0.250423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316186,"sim:weight":0.211527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I begin by arguing that the Teach First participants interviewed as part of an evaluation were predominantly middle-class, and possessed social and cultural capital which had facilitated their access to the Teach First scheme. I then illustrate three processes of middle-class reproduction within Teach First. The first is the accumulation by participants of additional social and cultural capital. The second is the reproduction of middle-class values and stereotypes of the working-class other, and the third is the obscuring of middle-class advantage through discourses of \u0027natural ability\u0027. I conclude that although well-intentioned Teach First participants worked extremely hard to combat educational disadvantage, their actions were twisted by class forces, and resulted in the reproduction of middle-class privilege.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smart, Sarah","Hutchings, Merryn","Maylor, Uvanney","Mendick, Heather","Menter, Ian"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108170,"sim:weight":0.223882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653284,"sim:weight":0.223707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.176495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52031,"sim:weight":0.175565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316083,"sim:weight":0.165368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.161383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.156337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.153167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.147825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.143193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108065,"sim:weight":0.142991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":1446017,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Mathematical Images and Gender Identities: A report on the gendering of representations of mathematics and\r\nmathematicians in popular culture and their influences on learners","bibo:abstract":"This report details research into the following questions:\r\nHow are representations of mathematics and mathematicians in popular culture gendered? How are the effects of these representations of mathematics and mathematicians in popular culture on learners gendered?\r\n\r\nTo address these questions, we draw on detailed analysis of the following data, collected as part of an earlier Economic and Social Research Council funded project:\r\n\r\nAbout 50 popular cultural texts including films, websites, books, radio and television programmes. Over 500 questionnaires from 14-15 year-old GCSE students and 100 questionnaires from undergraduates in mathematics and media studies. 15 focus groups with 15-16 year-old GCSE school students and 12 focus groups with undergraduates in mathematics and social sciences and humanities. 26 individual interviews with 15-16 year-old GCSE school students and 23 individual interviews with final year undergraduates in mathematics and with undergraduates and postgraduates in social sciences and humanities.\r\n\r\nThe main findings in relation to the gendering of representations of mathematicians and mathematics in popular culture are that:\r\n\r\nMathematical representations are both invisible and ubiquitous in popular culture. And whether something is seen as mathematical depends upon context and upon the reader’s understanding of and relationship with mathematics as well as on their other cultural\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nPopular culture texts strongly support the association of mathematics with masculinity, and also with Whiteness, middle-classness and heterosexuality. This gendering happens through: the dominant representations of mathematicians being men, the disappearing of women’s mathematical contributions and the ways that women doing mathematics are subordinated in a range of ways including their youth and their positioning as appendages to ‘greater’ male mathematicians.\r\n\r\nRepresentations of male mathematicians combine features that ally them with heroic and powerful men and also features that present them as other, including: mental health problems, obsessiveness, fragility,\r\nand social incompetence. Their ‘genius’ is seen to mark them out from others and all other aspects of the self are subjugated to this.\r\n\r\nThere is an emerging group of cultural texts featuring women mathematicians, several of which are part of a growing trend of young, attractive ‘smart girls’. While encouraging, there are questions to be raised about the low proportion of adult women mathematicians, the dramatised tensions between feminine heterosexuality and mathematics and the hyper-attractiveness of these characters.\r\n\r\nBoth the representations of women and of men mathematicians, in different ways, present their mathematical abilities as ‘natural’ and as something people are born with rather than something that is acquired.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the last point, representations of mathematics generally present this in ways that support ideas of its inaccessibility to the majority of the population.\r\n\r\nPopular representations of processes of doing mathematics show it as being about sudden and individual moments of inspiration that are accessible only to ‘geniuses’. This creative process is aligned with\r\nmasculinity. There are some trends in popular mathematics that offer alternatives to the clichés, notably mathematics incorporating aspects of beauty, creativity, empathy and accessibility. In particular, much popular mathematics is contestable rather than set in stone.\r\n\r\nThe main findings in relation to the gendered influence on learners of representations of mathematicians and mathematics in popular culture are that:\r\n\r\nThere are very strong default images of mathematicians that are easily called up; these default images of mathematicians are of old, White, middle-class, heterosexual men and are associated with markings onto and into the body, including states of clothing, posture, mental health and social awkwardness or geekiness. These images reflect those circulating in popular culture. They are shared by men and women.\r\n\r\nMost participants were unable to identify attractive but unknown women as mathematicians while being aware that this was problematic. There were mixed feelings about the use of such images to sell mathematics, particularly when they were overtly sexual.\r\n\r\nMathematics is constructed through a series of gendered oppositions such as numbers vs. words, technical vs. emotional and everyday vs. esoteric. These make mathematics something that is less attractive to\r\nwomen than to men.\r\n\r\nDiscourses of mathematicians are also characterised by oppositions, for example between ‘normal’ mathematicians and ‘real’ mathematicians, people with ‘natural’ ability and those who just cannot get it or who need to work hard to do so. These discourses link to distinctions between everyday and esoteric mathematics. Again, these images reflect those circulating in popular culture and were shared by men and women but have gendered effects.\r\n\r\nWomen are less likely to self-identify as having mathematical ability than men and this makes it more difficult for them to choose to continue with the subject. Both men and women’s sense of their mathematical\r\nability derived largely from external factors, prominent among these were assessment results and positions within teaching groups that are setted by ‘ability’.\r\n\r\nThe ways that people read images of mathematicians and mathematics depend on the understandings or resources people bring to them. For example, participants who identified with feminism more often read mathematical ability into feminine bodies and participants who identified with mathematics more often read examples of creativity as mathematical.\r\n\r\nPopular mathematicians and mathematics can provide a resource for developing positive relationships with mathematics. In particular, popular mathematicians can provide points of identification and popular mathematics can provide a space to explore ‘alternative’ understandings of mathematics that cut across some of the oppositions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mendick, Heather","Moreau, Marie-Pierre","Hollinworth, Sumi"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.374315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.372621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41344,"sim:weight":0.368381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53655,"sim:weight":0.363321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.359898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.345817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.325745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309620,"sim:weight":0.215763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Conversely, Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD) patients show dual task decrements, but it is unclear whether the problem arises at the encoding, maintenance, and/or retrieval phases of memory. Two experiments combined digit recall and visuo-motor tracking to investigate dual task effects during encoding, maintenance, and/or retrieval for AD patients compared with healthy adults. The demands of each single task were titrated for the ability of each participant. In Experiment 1, the dual task requirement was present throughout both encoding and retrieval of digit recall and the differential dual task effects on a secondary tracking task were examined post-hoc. In Experiment 2, the impact of dual task during encoding only, during maintenance only, and during retrieval only was examined systematically. The findings suggest that the specific AD deficit reflects impairment of a cognitive function that supports the simultaneous performance of two tasks in the healthy brain, particularly during the encoding and retrieval phases of the memory task.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sergio, Della Sala","Cocchini, Gianna","Robert, Logie","Michael, Allerhand","Sarah, MacPherson"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5848285,"sim:weight":0.390619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108964,"sim:weight":0.263449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26082,"sim:weight":0.241004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.199909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69993,"sim:weight":0.19427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1548630,"sim:weight":0.179505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.170418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26616,"sim:weight":0.160861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23814,"sim:weight":0.136441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.134929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.120942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85300,"sim:weight":0.111827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.0855988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Derrida’s essays, now published in book form as The Animal That Therefore I am, track the animal/ human distinction as it has infected so much of philosophical discourse. This distinction, in the shadow of Descartes’s influential distinction between reaction and response, banishes ‘the animal’ to the reactive outside of the distilled responsive inner circle of ‘the human.’ Where animal figures do show up in centre court they are yoked to an allegorical leash, constrained to play the human in another guise.

{"identifier":1446021,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Animal transference: a \"mole-like progression\" in C. J. Cherryh","bibo:abstract":"Writing in 1996 and thus prior to Derrida’s extensive treatment of the ‘animal question’ though simultaneous with her own book of anecdotal stories entitled Dog Love, Marjorie Garber suggests that the turn to animals in cultural studies is wholly describable as an effect of transference and that this transference concerns the displacement of an idealised humanism no longer tenable in such studies. Assuming that this transference occurs for the humans involved onto animals, here dogs, Garber does not imagine a counter-transference. She does not ask the question whether animals also transfer. Within her terms such a question would surely founder in anthropomorphism. Yet after Derrida we can no longer assume that we know in advance the grounds of the human that anthropomorphism is said to project. The anchorage of a human/animal division in a corresponding division between response and reaction is one to which Derrida has given specific attention as it surfaces in writings on subjectivity from Descartes to Lacan (2001, 2003). A kind of first-degree metaphysics of presence is interrupted by the psychoanalytic insistence upon an Unconscious: the ability to conduct a spontaneous and self-sufficient response is marred by a transference that classically expresses a repetition modelling a new edition of an old desire. However, Derrida argues that human self-presence – or self-presence as human – is problematically reinstated in the ethical conditions of the analytic session during which the analyst must attend to the so-called ‘Full Speech’ of the Unconscious. The analyst, like Garber, presumes to know who transfers onto whom.\r\n\r\nThis paper investigates the necessarily combined question of animal transference and technology through C. J. Cherryh’s astounding science-fiction (which has received surprisingly slight critical attention).  In How we became Posthuman (1999) N. Katherine Hayles glosses aspects of Cherryh’s usage of the virtual technology she calls ‘tape’ in her major novel Cyteen (1988), yet she positions it as largely anachronistic: the novel was written in the eighties after all.   This paper assumes that there is something more to tape – and the transference it both facilitates and figures.  In Cherryh’s related novel Forty Thousand in Gehenna (1983), a political experiment lands 40,000 humans including their emotionally unstable cloned companion ‘azi’ temporarily upon the strategically situated planet Gehenna. When all supplies run out including the ‘tape’ designed to condition and maintain the azi, all must learn to live and to become differently including with the assumed to be irrelevant indigenous species. Mystifying all with their continual insistence on shifting substantial quantities of earth around to no apparent end, the indigenous lizards’ practice of writing on Gehenna’s surface is not recognized as such until the ‘rescue’ mission belatedly arrives, to a dramatically altered species-scape, some generations later.\r\n\r\nIn his later work, Derrida hyphenates the inorganic, repetitious and reactive machine with the organic, spontaneous and responsive event thus indexing their non-exclusive relation: this paper makes clear that the organic components of such a machine-event cannot be assumed to circumscribe the human.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, Lynn"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.303056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86055,"sim:weight":0.297964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108327,"sim:weight":0.295327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108987,"sim:weight":0.27488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85453,"sim:weight":0.26288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.260227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.255865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.222433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The art therapy large experiential group of all the students and all the staff (80+), which is held six times a year on the 2-year full-time/3-year part-time programme, is identified with three educational components: learning about art therapy processes, learning about the educational process of becoming a professional, and learning about institutional and political issues relevant for the work-place.\r\n\r\nThis educational method engages the unconscious dynamics of both students and staff and brings this together, through creative activity, with a critical engagement in social and political issues. The group has implications for all health workers in its attention to non-verbal communication, activity as a means to learning and agency in institutional issues in the work-place. The paper brings together a case example in which students were able to process the impact of a nationwide, union strike in the university, with relevant literature from large group theory, small art therapy group theory and performance art. Discussion is given to the process by which the art therapy large group meets its learning objectives.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skaife, Sally","Jones, Kevin"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.549594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.522384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341217,"sim:weight":0.478637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101271,"sim:weight":0.47761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.475251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.457721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.443686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.439444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.43472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17989,"sim:weight":0.406702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43635,"sim:weight":0.404207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.40377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.397746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98854,"sim:weight":0.392598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.391252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.385425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.384998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80092,"sim:weight":0.383519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.378026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.376212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We return to the controversial UK Big Brother 2007 arguments involving Jade Goody and Shilpa Shetty. We explore how the dynamics of class, gender and race played out in this case. Using this example, we look at how celebrity culture, ideas of truth and dominant discourses of White working-class culture position both the housemates and their audiences. We further argue that the coverage of the event foreclosed any discussions of White middle-class racism by drawing on discourses that denigrate the White working-class.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mendick, Heather","George, Rosalyn P."],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930364,"sim:weight":0.402384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.396228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.357535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931334,"sim:weight":0.350225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643985,"sim:weight":0.345733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.337554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.325825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.325662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381940,"sim:weight":0.320977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45883,"sim:weight":0.320313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.310562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53655,"sim:weight":0.306521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43428,"sim:weight":0.304953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.303483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666433,"sim:weight":0.301786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.299947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761070,"sim:weight":0.294488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47210,"sim:weight":0.292259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46639,"sim:weight":0.287068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.287052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

But it is philosophy which enables us to address, directly, and from the inside, the question of ontology. The article proposes that this ontology is one of becoming, not of Being, and that it can be understood through Bergson\u0027s terms of memory and intuition.

These essays examine how Bulgarian historiography and literature over the centuries have created differing conceptions of Europe and, in the process, shaped the country\u0027s own shifting identity. Through such analyses, the essays provide the broader cultural context and historical perspective required in order to understand the country\u0027s EU accession process as well as its aftermath. This work ultimately addresses what has arguably been the key question facing Bulgaria in the post-Cold War period: \u0027Are we European?\u0027 This preoccupation with the question of Bulgaria\u0027s European identity stems in part from the prospect of joining the EU and thus becoming part of Europe\u0027s mainstream, and equally from the wider political, economic and security vacuum in which the dissolution of the Communist bloc left the country at the beginning of the 1990s. The collection will therefore also examine Bulgaria\u0027s process of integration into the EU within the context of contemporary political and economic developments, raising questions about the costs that Bulgarians have incurred in order to join European structures. \u0027Bulgaria and Europe: ShiftingIdentities\u0027 charts the country\u0027s attempts to confront a problematic present while it struggles to escape from the past and its legacy of fears.\r\n\r\n\u0027Bulgaria and Europe\u0027 breaks new ground as the only published study to discuss the way that \u0027Europe\u0027 has been conceptualized within Bulgaria and how this has affected the relations between them. It is therefore the first analysis that focuses on the issue of Bulgarian national identity, how this identity has developed in relation to Europe and the way in which such a development has affected Bulgaria\u0027s relations with the European continent, including post-Cold War relations with the EU.

This was part of Mahmud’s efforts to restore the depleted authority of the Ottoman central government which had been challenged by the politics of various disloyal warlords who operated in the Balkans and the Near East. Since the Sultan’s military campaign would engage a substantial portion of the Ottoman imperial armies, this presented a chance not to be missed by the Philikē Etaireia (Friendly Brotherhood), a secret organisation founded in 1814 in Odessa which recruited widely among the Greek-speaking world with the aim of overthrowing the Ottoman rulers from the ‘Motherland’ through an armed and coordinated revolt. The sporadic outbursts of violence in Peloponnesus in March 1821 assumed the form of an all-out revolt with a successful outcome.  The heavily outnumbered Ottoman army withdrew to its coastal fortresses after vicious fighting which was marked by atrocities on both sides.

After overnight abstinence they completed experimental tests of cue reactivity, attentional bias to smoking cues, response to financial reward, motor impulsiveness, and response inhibition (antisaccades).  They then started a quit attempt with follow-up after 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months; abstinence was verified via salivary cotinine levels ≤ 20ng/ml.\r\nResults: Relapse rates at each point were 52.5%, 64% and 76.3%.  The strongest predictor was pre-cessation salivary cotinine; other smoking / dependence indices did not explain additional outcome variance and neither did trait impulsivity.  All experimental indices except responsivity to financial reward significantly predicted one week outcome. Salivary cotinine, attentional bias to smoking cues and antisaccade errors explained unique as well as shared variance.  At one and three months, salivary cotinine, motor impulsiveness and cue reactivity were all individually predictive; the effects of salivary cotinine and motor impulsiveness were additive.\r\nConclusions: These data provide some support for the involvement of abnormal cognitive and motivational processes in sustaining smoking dependence and suggest that they might be a focus of interventions, especially in the early stages of cessation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDawkins L, Powell JH, Pickering AD, Powell JF, and West RJ (2009) Addiction 104, 850-8","bibo:AuthorList":["Powell, Jane H.","Dawkins, Lynne","Pickering, Alan","West, Robert","Powell, John F."],"dc:date":"2010-08-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6197677,"sim:weight":0.615182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26676,"sim:weight":0.552759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708261,"sim:weight":0.540064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632064,"sim:weight":0.494173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632065,"sim:weight":0.485715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101530,"sim:weight":0.465728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43554,"sim:weight":0.465376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197673,"sim:weight":0.39886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59089,"sim:weight":0.386251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17910,"sim:weight":0.372794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710109,"sim:weight":0.371393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145923,"sim:weight":0.371183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710070,"sim:weight":0.333988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586716,"sim:weight":0.323549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.310673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.299872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43210,"sim:weight":0.290237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710547,"sim:weight":0.279971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.27717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.276748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Factors that may be associated with such sensations include fluctuations in the electromagnetic field and the presence of infrasound. A review of such work is presented, followed by the results of the “Haunt” project in which an attempt was made to construct an artificial “haunted” room by systematically varying such environmental factors. Participants (N \u003d 79) were required to spend 50 minutes in a specially constructed chamber, within which they were exposed to infrasound, complex electromagnetic fields, both or neither. They were informed in advance that during this period they might experience anomalous sensations and asked to record on a floor-plan their location at the time occurrence of any such sensations, along with a note of the time of occurrence and a brief description of the sensation. Upon completing the session in the experimental chamber, they were asked to complete three questionnaires. The first was an EXIT scale asking respondents to indicate whether or not they had experienced particular anomalous sensations. The second was the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale, a widely used measure of belief in and experience of the paranormal. The third was Persinger’s Personal Philosophy Inventory, although only the items that constitute the Temporal Lobe Signs Inventory (TLS) sub-scale were scored. These items deal with psychological experiences typically associated with temporal lobe epilepsy but normally distributed throughout the general population. Although many participants reported anomalous sensations of various kinds, the number reported was unrelated to experimental condition but was related to TLS scores. The most parsimonious explanation for our findings is in terms of suggestibility.","bibo:AuthorList":["French, Christopher C.","Haque, Usman","Bunton-Stasyshyn, Rosie","Davis, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108797,"sim:weight":0.23514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108868,"sim:weight":0.216985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.207371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.198981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56397,"sim:weight":0.18542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388776,"sim:weight":0.184677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56680,"sim:weight":0.178507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24364,"sim:weight":0.173981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26084,"sim:weight":0.169786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.162075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56591,"sim:weight":0.144796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.13874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1925702,"sim:weight":0.138584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85129,"sim:weight":0.136306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Multivariate EEG signals were recorded while participants made preference decisions, based on approachability, between two faces presented sequentially with unrestricted viewing time; the decision being made after presentation of the second face. The paired faces were similar in their physical properties, emphasizing the role of the subjective experience of the participants in making the decisions. EEG signals were analyzed in terms of event-related-potential (ERP) components and wavelet-based time-frequency-representations (TFR). The behavioural data showed that the presentation order and the exposure duration did not influence preference formation. The EEG data showed three effects. The earliest effect, the sustained posterior ERP positivity for preferred first faces as compared to non-preferred first faces, was found following the onset of the first face, and this was interpreted as the formation of a positive first impression of the first face. The two later effects following the second faces were an increase of frontal theta band oscillations around 500 ms for preferred second faces and of posterior gamma band oscillations around 650 ms for preferred first faces; both of which were interpreted as being related to the formation of a preference. All of these effects occurred well before the moment of conscious decision, thereby suggesting the implicitness of these neurally identifiable components.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lindsen, Job P.","Jones, Rhiannon","Shimojo, Shinsuke","Bhattacharya, Joydeep"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"J P Lindsen, R Jones, S Shimojo and J Bhattacharya.

Behavioral research indicates four salient features of insightful problem solving: (i) mental impasse, followed by (ii) restructuring of the problem representation, which leads to (iii) a deeper understanding of the problem, and finally culminates in (iv) an “Aha!” feeling of suddenness and obviousness of the solution. However, until now no efforts have been made to investigate the neural mechanisms of these constituent features of insight in a unified framework.\r\n\r\nMethodology/Principal Findings:\r\nIn an electroencephalographic study using verbal remote associate problems, we identified neural correlates of these four features of insightful problem solving. Hints were provided for unsolved problems or after mental impasse. Subjective ratings of the restructuring process and the feeling of suddenness were obtained on trial-by-trial basis. A negative correlation was found between these two ratings indicating that sudden insightful solutions, where restructuring is a key feature, involve automatic, subconscious recombination of information. Electroencephalogram signals were analyzed in the space×time×frequency domain with a nonparametric cluster randomization test. First, we found strong gamma band responses at parieto-occipital regions which we interpreted as (i) an adjustment of selective attention (leading to a mental impasse or to a correct solution depending on the gamma band power level) and (ii) encoding and retrieval processes for the emergence of spontaneous new solutions. Secondly, we observed an increased upper alpha band response in right temporal regions (suggesting active suppression of weakly activated solution relevant information) for initially unsuccessful trials that after hint presentation led to a correct solution. Finally, for trials with high restructuring, decreased alpha power (suggesting greater cortical excitation) was observed in right prefrontal area.\r\n\r\nConclusions/Significance:\r\nOur results provide a first account of cognitive insight by dissociating its constituent components and potential neural correlates.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sandkühler, Simone","Bhattacharya, Joydeep"],"dc:date":"2008-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Sandkuhler and J Bhattacharya.

This leads to an open question: can music-elicited emotion be transferred to and/or influence subsequent vision-elicited emotional processing? Here we addressed this question by investigating processing of emotional faces (neutral, happy and sad) primed by short excerpts of musical stimuli (happy and sad). Our behavioural experiment showed a significant effect of musical priming: prior listening to a happy (sad) music enhanced the perceived happiness (sadness) of a face irrespective of facial emotion. Further, this musical priming-induced effect was largest for neutral face. Our electrophysiological experiment showed that such crossmodal priming effects were manifested by event related brain potential components at a very early (within 100 ms post-stimulus) stages of neuronal information processing. Altogether, these results offer new insight into the crossmodal nature of music and its ability to transfer emotion to visual modality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Logeswaran, Nidhya","Bhattacharya, Joydeep"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.373887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.370706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.341123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.341123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.338302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.330615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.330615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.327999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.327999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.319821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.272198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.239708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.233762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75992,"sim:weight":0.219926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9046388,"sim:weight":0.210244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.205909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.198359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.18767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.18767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.173695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In music perception, the confirmation and violation of expectations are critical to the communication of emotion and aesthetic effects of a composition. Neuroscientific research on musical expectations has focused on harmony. Although harmony is important in Western tonal styles, other musical traditions, emphasizing pitch and melody, have been rather neglected. In this study, we investigated melodic pitch expectations elicited by ecologically valid musical stimuli by drawing together computational, behavioural, and electrophysiological evidence. Unlike rule-based models, our computational model acquires knowledge through unsupervised statistical learning of sequential structure in music and uses this knowledge to estimate the conditional probability (and information content) of musical notes. Unlike previous behavioural paradigms that interrupt a stimulus, we devised a new paradigm for studying auditory expectation without compromising ecological validity. A strong negative correlation was found between the probability of notes predicted by our model and the subjectively perceived degree of expectedness. Our electrophysiological results showed that low-probability notes, as compared to high-probability notes, elicited a larger (i) negative ERP component at a late time period (400–450 ms), (ii) beta band (14–30 Hz) oscillation over the parietal lobe, and (iii) long-range phase synchronization between multiple brain regions. Altogether, the study demonstrated that statistical learning produces information-theoretic descriptions of musical notes that are proportional to their perceived expectedness and are associated with characteristic patterns of neural activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pearce, Marcus T.","Ruiz, María Herrojo","Kapasi, Selina","Wiggins, Geraint","Bhattacharya, Joydeep"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9321298,"sim:weight":0.22,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Independent component analysis (ICA) is a well-known technique for the correction of such ocular artifacts, but one of the limitations of ICA is that the ICs selected for removal contain not only ocular activity but also some EEG activity. Straightforward removal of these ICs might, therefore, lead to a loss of EEG data. In this article a method is proposed to separate blink-related ocular activity from actual EEG by combining ICA with a novel technique, empirical mode decomposition. This combination of two techniques allows for maximizing the retention of EEG data and the selective removal of the eyeblink artifact. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with simulated and real data.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lindsen, Job P","Bhattacharya, Joydeep"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75992,"sim:weight":0.406232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26814,"sim:weight":0.392588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23895,"sim:weight":0.350809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25992,"sim:weight":0.350142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.272972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.266718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.257505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.232895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.232767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.229142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.229142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.225934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.224132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.224132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.21997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.21997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.204767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.204767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.19182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.184075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Despite the ubiquitous presence of colorful displays, brain responses against different colour combinations are not properly studied. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we studied the photosensitivity of the human brain against three types of chromatic flickering stimuli by recording neuromagnetic brain responses (magnetoencephalogram, MEG) from nine adult controls, an unmedicated patient, a medicated patient, and two controls age-matched with patients. Dynamical complexities of MEG signals were investigated by a family of wavelet entropies. Wavelet entropy is a newly proposed measure to characterize large scale brain responses, which quantifies the degree of order/disorder associated with a multi-frequency signal response. In particular, we found that as compared to the unmedicated patient, controls showed significantly larger wavelet entropy values. We also found that Renyi entropy is the most powerful feature for the participant classification. Finally, we also demonstrated the effect of combinational chromatic sensitivity on the underlying order/disorder in MEG signals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that when perturbed by potentially epileptic-triggering stimulus, healthy human brain manages to maintain a non-deterministic, possibly nonlinear state, with high degree of disorder, but an epileptic brain represents a highly ordered state which making it prone to hyper-excitation. Further, certain colour combination was found to be more threatening than other combinations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bhagat, Mayank","Bhushan, Chitresh","Saha, Goutam","Shimjo, Shinsuke","Watanabe, Katsumi","Bhattacharya, Joydeep"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":107090,"sim:weight":0.35512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":625967,"sim:weight":0.229054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The principal aim of this paper is to develop an index, quantifying the complexity of such signals, which is based on the distribution of the strengths of its orthogonal oscillatory modes estimated by singular value decomposition. The index is first tested with simulated chaotic and/or stochastic maps and flows. Among neural data analysis, the index is first applied to a cognitive EEG data set recorded from two groups, musicians and non-musicians, during listening to music and resting state. In the gamma band (30-50 Hz), musicians showed robust changes in complexity, consistent over various scalp regions, during listening to music from resting condition, whereas such changes were minimal for non-musicians. Then the index is used to separate healthy participants from epileptic and manic patients based on spontaneous EEG analysis. Finally, it is used to track a tonic-clonic seizure EEG signal, and a conspicuous change was found in the complexity profiles of delta band (1-3.5 Hz) oscillations at the onset of seizure. We conclude that this index would be useful for quantification of a wide range of time series including neural oscillations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bhattacharya, Joydeep","Pereda, Ernesto"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25992,"sim:weight":0.371338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1925221,"sim:weight":0.350912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1925222,"sim:weight":0.3414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5845819,"sim:weight":0.338828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5506288,"sim:weight":0.333625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5845201,"sim:weight":0.333133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85382,"sim:weight":0.254681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998859,"sim:weight":0.238804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26814,"sim:weight":0.209019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85299,"sim:weight":0.203613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.194987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999700,"sim:weight":0.183546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23895,"sim:weight":0.162021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A new method was presented to estimate the strength of hidden universal structure in a multivariate data set. In this study, I investigated this method in the electrical activities (electroencephalogram signals) of human brain during complex cognition. Two broad groups--artists and non-artists--were studied during the encoding (perception) and retrieval (mental imagery) phases of actual paintings. Universal structure was found to be stronger in visual imagery than in visual perception, and this difference was stronger in artists than in non-artists. Further, this effect was found to be largest in the theta band oscillations and over the prefrontal regions bilaterally.

Previous studies reported an early ( approximately 200 ms) right anterior negative component (ERAN) by traditional event-related-potential analysis during music-syntactical irregularities, yet little is known about the underlying oscillatory and synchronization properties of brain responses which are supposed to play a crucial role in general cognition including music perception. First we showed that the ERAN was primarily represented by low frequency (\u003c8 Hz) brain oscillations. Further, we found that music-syntactical irregularities as compared with music-syntactical regularities, were associated with (i) an early decrease in the alpha band (9-10 Hz) phase synchronization between right fronto-central and left temporal brain regions, and (ii) a late ( approximately 500 ms) decrease in gamma band (38-50 Hz) oscillations over fronto-central brain regions. These results indicate a weaker degree of long-range integration when the musical expectancy is violated. In summary, our results reveal neural mechanisms of music-syntactic processing that operate at different levels of cortical integration, ranging from early decrease in long-range alpha phase synchronization to late local gamma oscillations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ruiz, María Herrojo","Koelsch, Stefan","Bhattacharya, Joydeep"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":949058,"sim:weight":0.526889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2951,"sim:weight":0.441496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9321298,"sim:weight":0.430365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9625808,"sim:weight":0.416938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177386,"sim:weight":0.406871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177380,"sim:weight":0.386293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107090,"sim:weight":0.373988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5622285,"sim:weight":0.36149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145566,"sim:weight":0.327697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767326,"sim:weight":0.319199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25992,"sim:weight":0.299087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23895,"sim:weight":0.251947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446683,"sim:weight":0.23532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1028513,"sim:weight":0.129695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1028091,"sim:weight":0.0978184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The vibrations (or idiomatically “vibes”) amongst the sound system audience (or “crowd”) on a night out on the Dancehall scene in Kingston, Jamaica, provide an example. Counting the repeating frequencies of these vibrations in a methodology inspired by Lefebvre’s (2004) rhythmanalysis results in a Frequency Spectrogram. This ranges from the sociocultural frequencies of nightly, weekly and seasonal cycles and circulations of musical style and fashion; to the material frequencies of the amplitudes and timbres of sound itself, with Reggae’s signature low-pitched bass-line; to the corporeal frequencies of the flesh and blood of the dancehall “crowd”, pulsating with heartbeats and kinetic dance rhythms. The vibration model then addresses the intensities of affect (Deleuze and Guattari 1988, Massumi 2002) in terms of auditory amplitudes, as with sonic dominance (Henriques 2003); feelings as frequencies; and the distinctive meaning of affect (Sedgwick and Frank 1995) as timbre. This aims to encourage the radical impulse of the idea of affect to abandon the traditional envelope of the autonomous, self-consistent, rational individual. The meaning of affect is thus located in the ratio, proportions and patterning of vibrations, that is, outside the discourse of emotions or representation of feelings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Henriques, Julian F."],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Listening to the voice of folly can be like this: an endless flow of inconsistencies, of contradictions, sayings and unsayings; a tantalising, mischievous mockery of speech –unable to go on, unable to end. And yet – as this volume shows – we are irresistibly drawn to folly, its promises, its whispers of ‘even more interesting’ things: of how we are split between conscious and unconscious, familiar and unfamiliar, same and other. For psychoanalysis, folly is not only a site of hidden truths; it is also, perhaps more importantly, a source of unconscious freedom, a momentary escape from our obsession with rules and order. According to Christopher Bollas, the unconscious self is like a fool, who ‘raises potentially endless questions about diverse and disparate issues’ and thereby provides us with a ‘separate sense’, which opens us to others and to our own creative potential. As Rachel Bowlby elegantly puts it, folly is a ‘soul-mole’, forever shovelling our secrets out into the light: ‘there’s no possible moment of release or resignation when the mole might stop vainly, interminably working away’. Folly’s subversive, creative soliloquies reveal to us a psychic ‘underground repertoire of secrets’; they challenge our established knowledge and invite us, as Bolwby shows, to endless, titillating games of ‘suppression and confession’. For Anne Duprat, this deep-seated playfulness explains folly’s close relation to fiction: what makes them so atone is their ‘capacity of creating alternative representations of the world — and thus of re-figuring the world depicted by reason or history – […] but also their paradoxical structure, and hence the instability of their speech acts, which deny, suspend, or do not seriously guarantee the truth of their statements’.\r\n(First paragraph)","bibo:AuthorList":["Boldrini, Lucia","Mussgnug, Florian"],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Despite the general recognition of Joyce’s interest in the Middle Ages and in such medieval figures as St. Thomas Aquinas, Dante, or St. Patrick, many issues still need to be investigated. Several books have been published on Joyce’s use of the work of individual philosophers and writers, or on themes that evolve from the medieval roots of Christian thought. The only book entirely devoted to an analysis of the subject in more encompassing terms, however, is Umberto Eco’s The Middle Ages of James Joyce: The Aesthetic of Chaosmos (1989 in English, but originally part of Eco’s seminal Opera Aperta, 1962). Eco’s slim but rich book was a path-opener, but it could not exhaust the subject on its own. Nearly forty years on, we are still looking for a comprehensive framework that can help us assess Joyce’s place in the larger context of nineteenth- and twentieth-century medievalism, and through which we may examine the concept of “the medieval” in his work. Did Joyce conceive of “the medieval” as a stable category offering a pre-determined set of themes and a codified language, a “tool-kit” as it were, that the modern writer could, or perhaps should, employ in the elaboration of his craft? In what ways did his writings reflect the great variety and complexity that is encompassed by the phrase “the Middle Ages”?

Secondly a session propagates the corporeal vibrations of rituals, dance routines and bass-line “riddims” (Veal 2007). Thirdly it propagates the ethereal vibrations (Henriques 2007b), “vibes” or atmosphere of the sexually charged popular subculture by which the crowd (audience) appreciate each dancehall session as part of the Dancehall scene (Cooper 2004). The paper concludes that thinking though vibrating frequencies makes it easier to appreciate how audiences with no direct or inherited connection with a particular music genre can be energetically infected and affected - to form a sonic diaspora.","bibo:AuthorList":["Henriques, Julian F."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1446144,"sim:weight":0.693542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1444508,"sim:weight":0.682851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.49901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108748,"sim:weight":0.497343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.456554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58923,"sim:weight":0.455068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.398663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.397567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.380004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.367669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.356432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.320731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Dante’s versions of the theory in the Convivio and the “Letter to Can Grande della Scala” are particularly important in this context, insofar as Dante was the first modern European poet to claim for his own love poetry the same interpretative method traditionally used for the divine word. In this essay I discuss whether Dante’s theory can be “applied” to the Wake, or whether it is in fact already inscribed within Joyce’s text, made part of its self-referential interpretative system, and with what effects for the theory as well as for the text. I argue that Dante’s medieval exegetical model is transformed in the Wake through precise references that constantly evoke and confound Dante’s terms, thus showing its inadequacy for the modern polysemic work but also, at the same time, acknowledging its fundamental role in the elaboration of such modern radical polysemy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boldrini, Lucia","Boldrini, Lucia"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Initially pining for Rome and its sophisticated, complex language, he learns to overcome his hostility towards the barbarous people and their language, but when he discovers a wild Child that had been raised by the wolves in the forest and captures him with the intention of teaching him to speak and to be human, he soon realises that he himself has to learn from the Child another language, based not on symbolization and arbitrary convention but on an intuitive identity with things, on becoming the things signified in silence.  After the death of the village’s elderly chief, which the villagers blame on the child’s demonic powers, the poet and the Child escape north across the frozen river. Ovid’s death is the poet’s final transformation, perhaps a literal metamorphosis like the ones described in Ovid’s great poem. Malouf’s Afterword concludes: \r\nMy purpose was to make this glib fabulist of ‘the changes’ live out in reality what had been, in his previous existence, merely the occasion for dazzling literary display. (IL 154)\r\nIs Malouf’s novel then a fantasy inspired by ‘mere’ literary dazzle or, as ‘a fiction with its roots in possible event’, is it a work that, while not claiming to the factual accuracy of biography or the broad reliability of the historical background of a historical novel, can however still claim to be rooted in verisimilitude, in events that, although not documented, are nevertheless possible, as would be the case with a realist novel, or in Aristotelian poetics? The Afterword thematizes a tension between the desire to anchor the novel to history and the desire to free Ovid from historical necessity. How can Ovid live out ‘in reality’ the metamorphoses to which he is subjected, if metamorphoses are but the occasion for ‘literary display’? \r\nThis tension also defines, more widely, the large number of novels written as if they were the autobiographies of historical personages, novels that gesture towards historical factuality and literary fictionality, towards ‘truth’ and invention, and exist under the sign of an essential structural displacement (the ‘autobiography’ is written by another) that brings to the foreground structural, narrative, and ethical issues also central to autobiography itself.\r\n(First paragraphs of submitted version)","bibo:AuthorList":["Boldrini, Lucia"],"dc:date":"2004-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Drawing on empirical evidence from Oldham and from the experiences of a project set up to work with the racist views of white children in Leeds, it explores how such work positively disrupts the public realm and challenges the framework of ‘multiculturalism’.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical basis of the paper is that anti-racist policies and practice have created a moral code which young people can either subscribe to or be punished by (Back, 1996) and that by failing to engage within a framework of inclusion and openness with young people who express racist views, agencies and workers risk alienating them from a positive recasting of those views. In some cases this could enable the process of promoting extremism.  \r\n\r\nThe paper argues that the failure of anti-racist policies as a form of multiculturalism  has promoted the alienation of those most in need of intervention regarding racism, and that ‘Community Cohesion’, as actually understood and practiced at ground level, can offer a productive way forward (Thomas, 2007) towards the potential for a ‘critical multiculturalism’(May, 1999).

{"identifier":1446175,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Article","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Comparative literature and translation, historical breaks and continuing debates: Can the past teach us something about the future?","bibo:abstract":"When in 1993 Susan Bassnett declared that “Today, comparative literature in one sense is dead”, she saw it destined to be subsumed within translations studies.  More recently, Bassnett has admitted that her prediction has shown itself to have been flawed: “translations studies has not developed very far at all over the last three decades and comparison remains at the heart of much translations studies scholarship.”  Bassnett’s death knoll for comparative literature 15 years ago, like Spivak’s more recent one,  are the consequences of the perceived Eurocentrism of the discipline, and the strong sense that the practices and the ideologies that sustain it require to be radically revised – if not even rejected – in the contemporary, more fluid, post-colonial, globalised world.\r\n\r\nHaun Saussy’s recent diagnosis that comparative literature “has won its battles” may sound rather more positive, but it also contains a stark warning about the discipline’s institutional low status and its risk of dispersion among other more established subjects to which it has contributed methods and an openness of the syllabus that was unthinkable until not very long ago. \r\n\r\nEven before Bassnett had time to revise her earlier prediction, Stanley Corngold had queried the notion of the close relationship between comparative literature and translation studies, remarking instead on their essential difference: while translation means carrying over a piece of foreign language into one’s own, “comparison” means being momentarily without one’s language, not needing to translate precisely because of one’s ability to translate, and thus respecting the otherness of languages and cultures. \r\n\r\nEmily Apter’s recent The Translation Zone: A New Comparative Literature  proposes a mediation of these positions. In her excellent study, translation emerges as the fulcrum of a new vision of comparative literature able to expand towards – to take up Spivak’s terminology – a genuine planetary criticism by pursuing unexpected links between as disparate issues as philology, globalization, war and peace, the web, the genetic code. Two opposite theses mark the two poles of Apter’s argument: nothing is translatable, and everything is translatable; at one end, the radical incommensurability of different languages and of cultural, political, aesthetic systems, at the other, the human(ist) will to find common roots, interests, concerns, and the search for codes that can translate one language into another.\r\n\r\nIt is these lively debates over the relationship between comparative literature and translation on the one hand, and over the present and future of comparative literature on the other, that will form the context and the background of my paper, which proposes to reconsider these positions from different but related angles. What can a historical perspective contribute to our understanding of the relationship between comparative literature and translation in their present predicaments? For example, how can the assumptions of (un)translatability, the relationships between culture/knowledge and power, between translation and imperialism be illuminated by a renewed awareness of  the link between translatio studii and translatio imperii as it was formulated in the middle ages and early modern period to describe the transferral of culture and of power from east to west – (from the Middle East to Greece, from here to Rome, and later from Rome to the Holy Roman Empire, or to the Anglo-Norman court of Britain)? How can the question of the flattening effect of a global form of English be not only reconsidered in the light of the lingua franca of Latin in the medieval world, but also informed by a reflection on the heritage of the medieval mediation of human knowledge through the linguistic sciences of the artes sermocinales, which ensured a form of universal translatability of the known? How have later recoveries of these perspectives, such as Eliot’s rather debatable statement on the easy translatability, and thus the superiority, of a Dante who writes in a recognisable common language because of its proximity to Latin, continued to inform, and to an extent deform, our sense of the human values at the heart of the enterprise of comparing and translating?\r\n\r\nIt will be impossible to give definitive and expansive answers to all these questions in the short time of the presentation, and the aim of the paper is to suggest the widening of the debate on these issues to a broader historical and conceptual framework, and trace some possible directions that this opening up may take. \r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to raise another question to which it may also be difficult to find concrete and pragmatic answers, but which must nevertheless be asked: what practical steps would it be useful for us as comparatists to take in order to continue to promote this “discipline” that continues to be declared dead, or flawed, if not even pernicious for the ideological heritage that it carries within itself, but which somehow carries on, evolves, and continues to fascinate us and push us towards the encounter of the other as equal, but not as same?","bibo:AuthorList":["Boldrini, Lucia"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1445976,"sim:weight":0.56282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.316509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.316509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The status of dominant languages (from Greek to Classical Latin, to Medieval Latin, and more recently to English) and the way the relationship between the hegemonic language and the common language of the people has been constructed at various historical moments adds complexity to this question, as a notion of value based on eloquence and aesthetics as the foundation of civilization (and/or ‘civility’) have had to compete, at different junctures (from Dante to Montaigne, from European Romanticism to Modernism), with the attribution of value to the ideal of the ‘common people’, the ‘noble savage’, and various forms of simplicity and primitivism. These competing but mutually dependent concepts have informed European colonialism, dividing the European from its ‘non-European other’ (the ‘erring barbarian’, as Iago calls Othello), but have also divided Europe along historically changeable boundaries (Barbarians threatening the Roman Empire from the North and East, descriptions of the ‘medieval Balkans’ by nineteenth-century Western European travellers, the primitive South seen from the Protestant North in the writings of Mme de Staël, André Gide, D.H. Lawrence…), while artificially constructed periodizations (e.g., ‘the medieval’) collaborate in defining the ‘true’ nature of Europe (as when Eliot nostalgically praises the undivided medieval ‘mind of Europe’ that can ‘think together’, or politicians want to include references to ‘the Christian roots of Europe’ in the EU Constitution).\r\nMy paper will delineate, contextualise and discuss some of the main questions raised by these complex and changing relationships. One of these concerns the possibility of translation across such boundaries: how, for a start, can the complexity of modern European civilization be translated into simpler, primitive language systems and world views, and what are the implications of such supposedly unequal encounter for translation theory itself? (Though the question of translation of the ‘primitive’ into the ‘civilized’ is rarely asked, as such appropriation does not appear to pose the same categorical problem, it also raises significant issues, not least that of a re-assessment of the medieval association of translatio imperii with translatio studii, i.e. the transferral of power alongside knowledge on clearly identified geo-cultural-political lines). Crucially, how have these notions –the relationship between an ideal of civilization based on eloquence and aesthetics, the ideal of ‘the common people’, and the coincidence between national and literary/cultural identity– informed from its beginnings, and continue to inform, in Europe and globally, the definition and nature of ‘comparative literature’?","bibo:AuthorList":["Boldrini, Lucia"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1446253,"sim:weight":0.318829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This work is a collaboration of a team of four art therapy educators (Dr Sheridan Linnell, Suzanne Perry, Josephine Pretorius) from the University of Western Sydney. The work explores the interface of our experiences in our roles and identities as artists, art therapists and educators.  A complex emotional landscape is created which is inspired by the use of art based methods in learning about becoming an art therapist. Aspects of this work have been presented at several different sites. \r\n\r\nAs art therapy educators we have observed the effectiveness of art based methods in teaching and learning with students.

These topics lead to philosophical depths and questions that we are beginning to explore primarily through the experience of creating art work on these themes related to art therapy and education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Westwood, Jill"],"dc:date":"2009-09-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Once we understand human rights as social constructions rather than as moral absolutes or as legal entitlements (the latter being the most common way of seeing them in an area of study that is dominated by legal experts), it is clear that sociologists have an important role in investigating the specific historical, cultural, and geo-political conditions that make it possible to secure respect for human rights in practice.  Human rights are social in that they are constructed and sustained in ongoing practices that orient and organise intentions and actions.  Although they may be claimed by individuals, it is only through collective meanings and institutions that they can be effective.  In addition, sociologists may be interested in the often unintended effects of the institutionalisation of human rights on other aspects of social life.  The chapter rehearses some of the most important areas to be developed for a sociology of human rights: globalization and state transformation; organizations, legalization and the limits of law; subjectivity and solidarity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nash, Kate","Nash, Kate","Amenta, Edwin","Scott, Alan"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We have a predisposition to envision and create new future realities in a way that has been described as an intrinsic and defining characteristic of being human and that is vital for cultural evolution. It is a capability that exists as innate\r\npotential. \r\nIn this paper I argue that it is a critical responsibility of educators to develop design capability in all learners at all levels of education. To do this effectively requires a radical questioning of assumptions about the similarities and differences between educating young children and future professional designers, about the nature of difference between novice and expert designer, and of the value placed on developing the designerly potential in all.\r\n\r\nI also argue for a closer alignment between researching designing in a professional context and researching designing in younger learners as a way of bringing mutual benefit and a greater understanding of the value the designerly has, both for the individual and for civilisation. In the first section of the paper I lay out some of the concerns that have been raised, historically and currently, over the place of design education in the curriculum. I then move to explore the issues raised through drawing on a number of research projects conducted in the Technology Education Research Unit at Goldsmiths.

The relationship between creativity and environmental sustainability is explored in three separate contexts: in a design and technology schools context where teenage learners are being facilitated to develop creative responses within design briefs that include environmental considerations; through interviewing student teachers who have undertaken an ecodesign project; and through interviews with professional ecodesign practitioners. The tensions, compromises and contradictions evident where there is limited experience of environmental issues is contrasted with the level of optimisation and creativity engaged when designers have more maturity in this area.

It focuses on England’s New Technologies Demonstrator Program, established to test the \u0027viability\u0027 of \u0027green\u0027 waste treatments by awarding state aid to eight experimental projects that promise to divert municipal waste from landfill and greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The article examines how these demonstrator sites are arranged and represented to produce non-controversial and publicly accessible forms of evidence and experience and, ultimately, to inform environmental policy and planning decisions throughout the country. As in experimental science, this process requires that some bear witness to the demonstrators, but in a disciplined way. Whether through the extrapolation of facts about technical performance by affiliated third-party consultants, or the orchestration of visitor centers open to the general public, making the demonstrators public involves controlling the ways in which they are interpreted and perceived. However, the unstable publicity of waste management facilities proliferates unofficial accounts as well. These acts of counter-witnessing, as I refer to them, not only potentially dispute the official evidence collected from the demonstrators, they also can pose a challenge to the understanding of technology upon which such government initiatives are based.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reno, Joshua"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86062,"sim:weight":0.338551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84852,"sim:weight":0.240792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.234262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.227092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.221066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.213316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.202925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.108942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Wireless communication, however, presents distinct ways of understanding media as it exceeds the devices, interfaces, and wires through which we typically conceive of the medium of communication. Working initially with Marconi’s transmission of wireless signals between Cornwall, England, and Newfoundland, Canada, this chapter charts how that first wireless exchange, ‘dot … dot … dot’, relocates wireless media from the 19th Century ocean to the contemporary city, and multiplies towards a concentration of wireless exchanges that give rise to expanded ecologies of transmission. This chapter explores how an atmospheric mode of communication –like the ether, resonant and electric – delineates urban spaces that are characterised by emanation, presence, and surround. Originally presented in 2005 as part of the ‘Mobile Digital Commons Network’ symposium (http://www.mobilelab.ca/mdcn/index.html), this chapter develops an investigation into wireless cities through reconsidering urban communication and exchange through atmospheric topologies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gabrys, Jennifer","Crow, Barbara","Longford, Michael","Sawchuk, Kim"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":388729,"sim:weight":0.470947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.438898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443360,"sim:weight":0.432256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445490,"sim:weight":0.43204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.42124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.404226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.401332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352169,"sim:weight":0.39956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45374,"sim:weight":0.39767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.394719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.389328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.38704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.383525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.380859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48370,"sim:weight":0.380794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.372885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.372589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.360516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99288,"sim:weight":0.358359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710128,"sim:weight":0.353854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Arts-sciences discourses are one area in which increasing numbers of practitioners and researchers are exploring ways in which interdisciplinarity may provide a space for reconsidering the role of cultural and creative responses to environmental change. Yet what new perspectives does the arts-science intersection offer for rethinking to climate change? Which historic conjunctions of arts-sciences are most useful to consider in relation to present-day practices, or in what ways do these previous alignments significantly shift in response to climate change? The uncertainty, contingency, and experimentation necessarily characteristic of climate change may generate emergent forms of practice that require new approaches—not just to arts and sciences, but also at the new thresholds, or ‘meetings and mutations’ that these practices cross. Thresholds—narrated here through the figure of ‘zero degrees’—offer a way to bring together sites of encounter, transformations, uncertainties, future scenarios, material conditions and political practices in relation to climate change. Such shifting thresholds and relations lead not to fundamental re-definitions or demarcations of arts and sciences, arguably, but rather to shared encounters with politics. Drawing on philosophies of aesthetics and sciences elaborated by Jacques Rancière (2004) and Isabelle Stengers (2000), we point to the ways in which political possibility is entangled with aesthetic-material conditions and practices, and how recognition of these interrelations might enable ‘collective experimentation’ (Latour 2004a) within both creative practices and climate sciences.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gabrys, Jennifer","Yusoff, Kathryn"],"dc:date":"2011-04-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.267581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84852,"sim:weight":0.237197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.235641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.182333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.175248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108175,"sim:weight":0.151079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The structured interview relies heavily on language and enquires about general motor ability whereas the VATAm is less dependent on language abilities and enquires about specific motor tasks.

The project explored how designers can intervene sensitively within local urban food growing communities by providing a design thinking and crafting to help to sustain these initiatives and catalyse larger positive changes in the surrounding environment. The project was based at Central St. Martins in London, UK, facilitated by the design research group Loop.pH and funded by the Audi Design Foundation. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the project was to create, test and adapt tools and services for collaborative food growing in challenging city spaces. These included community workshops, urban grow-kits and an online collaborative network. A team of designers guided local participants through a set of envisioning, crafting, planting and documenting processes.

Second and third generation children, in particular, are assumed to be learning sufficiently through English only. This study investigated how British Bangladeshi children, learning Bengali in after-school classes but mostly more fluent in English than in their mother tongue, responded when able to use their full language repertoire within the mainstream curriculum. Through action research with mainstream and community language class teachers, bilingual literacy and numeracy tasks were devised and carried out with pupils aged seven to eleven in two East London primary schools. The bilingual activities were videorecorded and analysed qualitatively to identify the strategies used. The following cognitive and cultural benefits of bilingual learning discovered by researchers in other contexts were also found to apply in this particular setting: conceptual transfer, enriched understanding through translation, metalinguistic awareness, bicultural knowledge and building bilingual learner identities. The findings suggest that second and third generation children should be enabled to learn bilingually, and appropriate strategies are put forward for use in the mainstream classroom.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kenner, Charmian","Gregory, Eve E.","Ruby, Mahera","Al-Azami, Salman"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.32868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108297,"sim:weight":0.288251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.27284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.249899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This development seeks, through an exploration of literature in the field, to locate pedagogy that:\r\n•\tsupports partnerships in assessment that lead to empowered autonomous learners.\r\n•\tprovides opportunities for student voice that support the students’ growing ability to think critically about – and take responsibility for – their own assessment.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this paper uncovers a conceptual model located in critical pedagogy that might be argued to move away from a dominant discourse of assessment that illuminates the role of students as passive recipients, toward a discourse that supports the development of student autonomy and more effective student/academic partnerships. It puts forward a critical pedagogy of assessment that might involve an entirely new orientation, one that embraces a number of principles that may not be familiar in generic higher education assessment practice. These principles are rooted in dialogic interactions so that the roles of teacher and learner are shared and teacher and, particularly, student voices are validated. The paper goes on to suggest that by closely examining what is meant by the term student voice, it is possible to begin to envisage a conceptual model for integrating student voice into higher education assessment practice. Through this model, we might juxtapose the transformative goals of critical pedagogy with the transformative possibilities of student voice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bain, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.631447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99108,"sim:weight":0.522353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.517762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.484659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.474051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.465547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.446097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85165,"sim:weight":0.429532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103052,"sim:weight":0.426999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.422645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.421287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584852,"sim:weight":0.413425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386857,"sim:weight":0.410482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.405755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.400869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.383895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.370059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.363423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.354503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.347814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Whereas many contributors to this book have addressed contemporary alternative educational initiatives, I consider one that started in the mid-1960s and is still active today. In this way, I emphasize the continuity in radical experimentation in utopian pedagogy. In the case of New Beacon Circle, such experimentation has been a component of contestant responses to specific situations of class and \u0027race\u0027 domination, and which have been, simultaneously, attempts to build progressive educational alternatives that might endure into the future. Bringing a particular reading of anti-colonialism in the British West Indies to their activist work in London, the New Beacon Circle is centred around the New Beacon publishing house and bookshop, which was established in 1966. Over the next four decades, New Beacon Circle’s activities encompassed and wove together Black cultural production, anti-racist organizing and community education. This chapter explores a number of initiatives of the New Beacon Circle and concludes by analyzing them through the lens of cultural politics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alleyne, Brian"],"dc:date":"2007-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Presenting data from an action research project in East London primary schools, we show how children investigated metaphor and cultural content in a Bengali lullaby, clarifying concepts through dialogue with their parents. Comparison with a lullaby in English from North America generated additional ideas concerning different cultural values. The learning process enabled children to use their bilingual skills and draw on different aspects of their bicultural identities. Finally, we explain how bilingual poetry can be used to stimulate learning in a multilingual classroom context, through the example of a whole-class lesson based around Bengali and English lullabies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kenner, Charmian","Al-Azami, Salman","Gregory, Eve E.","Ruby, Mahera"],"dc:date":"2008-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.294663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108297,"sim:weight":0.2598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.25534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.231083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.208628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85363,"sim:weight":0.203559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Public access to buildings and outdoor spaces, visitor education and participatory learning have emerged as broad themes in designing activities that position the tour as a mediating process in learning  through and about the built environment.  The focus for this paper is to consider theoretical perspectives on ‘site’ and ‘context’ that are relevant to designing learning activities associated with touring buildings.  The paper concludes with a brief description of two new concepts for learning through touring, ‘seeding’ and ‘threading’, that have emerged from my wider practice in designing learning and touring projects with mobile devices.  These processes aim to stretch ways in  which participants may generate context in guided tours.

Proposals for smart dust have been developed in the form of tiny wireless sensors that could be released en masse, so that countless machines are in constant relay, coordinating information about an environment. Wireless sensors, distributed and embedded in environments, move the “information city” from a zone where digital media is produced and circulated by media workers, to a space where the city itself is a site of information generation – an urban information ecology. This sensor technology is less concerned with increasing computing power and more attentive to reducing the size of hardware, a technological shift that would allow millions of tiny machines to be deployed in drifts of simultaneous communication.\r\n\r\nIn order to examine further the modalities of machine-to-machine communication, this chapter engages with the notion of telepathy, or literally, “remote sensation,” which could be seen to be invisible and instant communication beyond the channels of human sense. This is a process of displaced sensation, of sensing in an extraordinary capacity, or of communicating impressions beyond the reach of usual communicative practices. Wireless sensors – particularly in the more hypothetical form of smart dust – perform this removal and rerouting of sensation. Urban ecologies are monitored, programmed, and made into transmittable information, but this sensory information transpires through relatively opaque machinic spaces – and the messages circulated may be decoded as much through conjecture as clear communication. Originally developed through the Culture of Cities project in 2004, this chapter considers urban environments as spaces of informational correspondence, and discusses early notions around the Internet migrating to environmental operations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gabrys, Jennifer","Boutros, Alexandra","Straw, Will"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.424407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76460,"sim:weight":0.416511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.402043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.38826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734401,"sim:weight":0.383732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.371117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.366563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109076,"sim:weight":0.359795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.344038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.342847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.342847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.311038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108661,"sim:weight":0.304999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.287011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Through a small scale case study, the research uses a quasi-experimental approach to examine participant’s perception of peer assessment prior and subsequent to a set of experiential intervention activities that were designed to develop a democratic and dialogic conceptulisation of peer assessment rooted in critical pedagogy. It was hypothesised that exposure to these intervention activities might alter participant’s perceptions of the peer assessment process. Findings from the research suggest this hypothesis to be accurate and appear to reveal a change in participant attitudes to peer assessment from one dominated by teacher-centred, or didactic, understandings to one where the role of student voice should be central. The subsequent interpretation and discussion seeks to illuminate the value of understanding how such an approach to peer assessment might help develop learners’ growing ability to take responsibility for their own learning and contribute to developing D\u0026T assessment practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bain, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It identifies a number of social boundaries between people that negatively affect students subject to permanent exclusion, to the extent that they can be seen as constituting incidents of institutional racism. For example, the high statistical currency of the English language and the lack of adequate translation facilities are shown to constitute social boundaries between people that undermine the participation of parents in school exclusion and inclusion processes. Age assessments for immigrant and refugee children are also seen to affect institutional responses to individual cases of permanent exclusion from school. Assumptions about what excluded students ‘need’ are found to sometimes be made on the basis of reductive skin-colour labels, and a disconnect is discovered between the discourses that school and family are socially authorised to adopt in discussing students at risk of exclusion. It is recommended that institutional racism in schooling is acknowledged and acted upon by both policy makers and practitioners.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carlile, Anna"],"dc:date":"2010-10-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.318539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.289646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108621,"sim:weight":0.271171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.246375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.221343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.190565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.188861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

How will the practice of design develop and change under the ethos of critical inquiry? Indeed, what version of ‘critique’? Taking inspiration from Latour’s essay \u0027Why Has Critique Run out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern (2004), this paper will outline how we are introducing concepts and methods derived from science and technology studies (STS), principally developments in actor-network theory (ANT), as part of the BA and MA design programmes at Goldsmiths. To begin, we provide a brief reading of Latour’s essay, discussing its relevance for design education. In doing so we aim to propose an alternative version of critical practice: a criticality that is oriented towards a non-reductive empirical realism tracing the complex messy entanglements of societies with all their strange, weird and wonderful hybrid objects. At the core of the paper, then, is the question of how designers might adopt a realist empirical approach towards the research of societies, actors and networks, whilst allowing for creative speculation.  To address this question we present two case studies to highlight the benefits and shortfalls of an STS and ANT inspired approach to design. The first describes a series of workshops with which we encourage our students to adopt the concepts and methods of STS and ANT as part of their design practice. In the second case study we present a design brief in which we ask students to seriously address fictional futures through the associative mingling of statistical entities. In doing so we are exploring how design can address the mediation of expectations and temporality: how, for example, designers might act with ‘matters of concern’ to prospect futures. Each of the case studies highlights a problematic found within both ANT and Design: the first issue is one of truncation. How, in accepting an empirical logic of connectivity, designers delimited and edit their networks of observation and influence. The second case study focuses on the issue of temporality, or more specifically \u0027future orientation\u0027, \u0027potential\u0027 or \u0027prospect\u0027. Here, design can be seen as a means of ‘departure’ in the material-semiotic lives of objects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilkie, Alex","Ward, Matt"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1446392,"sim:weight":0.558827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.49297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.475442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.394231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

MetaboliCity is the name for a vision of a city that metabolizes its resources and waste to supply its inhabitants with all the nourishment they need and more. This one-year (October 2008 – October 2009) participatory design research project on urban agriculture is based at Central Saint Martins, School of Art and Design and funded by the Audi Design Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to design an urban grow-kit accompanied by a set of guidelines to be tested and developed at a selection of sites in London, UK. This is a design-service system that integrates both traditional and hi-tech industrialized agricultural techniques into the fabric of the built environment whilst simultaneously being rooted in permaculture thinking. Permaculture is defined as an ‘ecological design system’ that empowers city-dwellers to create ‘sustainable human habitats by following nature’s pattern’. (Robert Hopkins, 2008, p203) \r\n\r\nThe complex nature of the project calls for a Metadesign approach. Metadesign can be described as ‘a shared design endeavour aimed at sustaining emergence, evolution and adaptation’. It creates ‘open-ended and infinite interactivity capable of accommodating always-new variables’. (Giaccardi, 2005) Metabolicity will test and adapt collaborative tools and processes that have been developed as a part of the ‘Benchmarking Synergy Levels within Metadesign’, AHRC funded research project, at Goldsmiths, University of London (2005-2008).\r\n\r\nThe project is facilitated by a design and research team, the participants are amateur food producers based at four different sites in London. There are special advisors on hand from the fields of plant science, permaculture, cooking, farming, wildlife and eco-architecture. The participatory nature of the project is informed by the notion of ‘Citizen Science’ (Irwin, 1995), where amateurs and specialists are engaged in a non-hierarchical process. The project explores how designers can work in multiple ways, taking on different roles within an interdisciplinary context, mediating between experts and amateurs in the field of urban agriculture. The role of the designers is to cultivate shared processes of envisioning, weaving and growing within each of these local contexts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Hannah","Wingfield, Rachel"],"dc:date":"2009-11-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1446276,"sim:weight":0.748365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.464511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.428604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.423826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.369361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.369361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Negotiation is seen as one of a set of potential interactive strategies, but one that ensures the most equitable correspondence between human and machine. Through mutual negotia- tion (involving listening/feature extraction and adaptation) the two par- ticipants attempt to satisfy their own and each other’s target outcome, without knowing the other’s goal. Each iteration is evaluated by both participants and compared to their target. In this model of negotiation, we query the notion of ‘flow’ as an objective of creative human-computer collaboration.

Adaptability can be a significant factor in human/machine interaction in this context. Intimacy is an additional factor; intimacy might be achieved if human and machine performers can adapt to each other and learn from one another. Previously associated in computer music with ideas of embodiment and HCI, intimacy as more widely understood, refers to the interpersonal process enjoyed between individuals, in which personal self-disclosure finds validation through a partner\u0027s response. Real intimacies are learned over time, not designed, and are based upon an evident reciprocity and emergent mutuality. In the context of musical expression, a social  rather than a biological/technological discourse can be applied to live algorithms with a capacity for learning.

Reflecting on how an education in virtue became an education of the will, the paper explores how some characters become “willful parts” when they do not align their wills with the moral and general will. Drawing on readings of willfulness in novels by George Eliot, including Daniel Deronda, Mill on the Floss and Romola, the paper explores how feminist histories might involve the willful claiming of the attribite of willfulness. The paper suggests that when willfulness is reclaimed, it exceeds the very system of characterization, even when it appears to fulfill a set of expectations of what is behind an action.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ahmed, Sara"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It examines the general design used in curriculums, within the arts, to propose a set of principles by which academic practice can be re-defined and improved. It argues that its present logic, based on an industrial model, fragmentary and hierarchic, is no longer fully operative and that in order to have an updated correspondence with the contemporary state of affairs, it should be reassessed and replaced by an organic model, integral and negotiable.\r\n\r\nDrawing on the possibility of art and design Higher Education to inform change, and on the verge of the social demand for both equality and difference, the paper explores the notion of a criteria of interests based on need, by hypothetically replacing –problem solving- for –problem making- as first priority in education.\r\n\r\nIt argues that the quality of academic results, or the ability to raise relevant questions, depends on methodologies that correlate to responsibility and to the promotion of individual agency, for which art and design Higher Education offers a privilege research field.

It is written from the perspective of science and technology studies, in particular developments in actor-network theory, and draws on the notion of the assemblage from the work of Deleuze and Guattari. The data for this thesis derives from a six-month field study of the routine discourse and practices of user-centered designers working for a multinational microprocessor manufacturer. The central argument of this thesis is that users are assembled along with the new technologies whose design they resource, as well as with new configurations of socio-cultural life that they bring into view. Informing this argument are two interrelated insights. First, user-centered and participatory design processes involve interminglings of human and non-human actors. Second, users are occasioned in such processes as sociotechnical assemblages. Accordingly, this thesis: (1) reviews how the user is variously applied as a practico-theoretical concern within human-computer interaction (HCI) and as an object of analysis within the sociology and history of technology; (2) outlines a methodology for studying users variously enacted within design practice; (3) examines how a non-user is constructed and re-constructed during the development of a diabetes related technology; (4) examines how designers accomplish user-involvement by way of a gendered persona; (5) examines how the making of a technology for people suffering from obesity included multiple users that served to format the designers’ immediate practical concerns, as well as the management of future expectations; (6) examines how users serve as a means for conducting ethnography-in-design. The thesis concludes with a theoretically informed reflection on user assemblages as devices that: do representation; resource designers’ socio-material management of futures; perform modalities of scale associated with technological and product development; and mediate different forms of accountability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilkie, Alex"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.641653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.633555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187543,"sim:weight":0.627427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69535,"sim:weight":0.602331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446360,"sim:weight":0.571979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3018,"sim:weight":0.563989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446355,"sim:weight":0.558827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187731,"sim:weight":0.558411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11127,"sim:weight":0.554282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187693,"sim:weight":0.547083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69536,"sim:weight":0.545704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187698,"sim:weight":0.543434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3747,"sim:weight":0.537807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271237,"sim:weight":0.52451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445178,"sim:weight":0.524266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187495,"sim:weight":0.524135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70800,"sim:weight":0.511679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710679,"sim:weight":0.510227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3978,"sim:weight":0.50629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4408,"sim:weight":0.503816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Their experience highlights the subtlety of domestic ubiquitous computing, illustrating alternatives to traditional views of technology’s domestic role.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gaver, William","Bowers, John","Boucher, Andy","Law, Andy","Pennington, Sarah","Villar, Nicholas"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8998719,"sim:weight":0.475895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.455407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.415431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.367258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.366727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.335728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.327893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.320091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.320091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.317933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.313932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447070,"sim:weight":0.308163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.302432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Working with London households, the team has designed pieces that electronically highlight aspects of the local environment, transforming information to encourage exploration, interpretation and wonder. The designs themselves are shown alongside documentary films that capture how Londoners lived with the furniture in their homes.\r\n\r\nOn show will be several pieces, including:\r\n\u003e The Plane Tracker – an appliance that tracks passing flight traffic and imagines views of their journeys.\r\n\u003e The Local Barometer – small devices that display text and images from local classifieds as if blown through the home.\r\n\u003e The Drift Table – a table that drifts over the landscape giving aerial views of Britain.\r\n\r\nThis work avoids the well-worn paths of using digital technologies to support work, consumption and leisure. In the studio’s view, new technologies should encourage people to become active participants in their digital lifestyles, helping them explore the world around them rather than seeking to escape it.\r\n\r\nAs well as seeing how people have lived with these unique pieces, there is an opportunity for visitors to get involved as the studio is looking for additional adopters of future work.\r\n\r\nThe Curious Home brings together the work of the Interaction Research Studio¡¦s six-year project investigating the future of domestic technology and how we live with it. This work has received international exposure in the past, and the Curious Home Exhibition is a chance to see previously exhibited work alongside new pieces.\r\n\r\nAn illustrated catalogue, including essays by noted commentators on design, technology and society, will be published to accompany the exhibition.\r\n\r\nEquator is a six-year Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) that brings together researchers based in seven UK universities.\r\n\r\nEquator’s central goal is to investigate the integration of the physical and digital worlds by developing innovative systems.

Complex design problems change over time and the interactions among the components of the problem and the interaction between the problem and its environment are of such that the system as a whole cannot be fully understood simply by analyzing its components (Cilliers 1998, pp. I). Ideation for this research is defined as a process of generating, developing and communicating ideas that are critical to the design process (Broadbent, in Fowles 1979, pp. 15). Based on Karni and Arciszewski, who stated that ideation tools should act more like an observer or suggester rather than controller or an expert, I defne design ideation tools as tools or methods that enhance, increase and improve the user\u0027s ability to generate ideas with the client (Karni and Arciszewski 1997; Reineg and Briggs 2007).\r\n\r\nBased on a survey of over 70 ideation tools, protocol analysis of design activities, a web survey and semistructured interviews, I conclude that designers and clients may not have sufficient knowledge of ideation or ideation tools in either testing or practice as a catalyst for generating possibilities and that measuring ideation tools based on how many ideas they generate is misleading because it relates creativity and idea generation but does not adequately reflect the participants\u0027 experience. This research suggests that participants\u0027 cultural perceptions of design ideation and the design process actively inhibit idea generation and that a shift from design outcome led ideation tool design to designing ideation tools that engage design contexts are necessary to effectively address complex design problems. This research identifed a gap in ideation tools for designers to collaborate with their clients during the ideation phase to catalyse possibilities to complex design problems as the contribution to new knowledge.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spellman, Kevin James"],"dc:date":"2010-08-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931828,"sim:weight":0.601903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.570827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":362098,"sim:weight":0.560221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931672,"sim:weight":0.552042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5228831,"sim:weight":0.525563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":285978,"sim:weight":0.501864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95746,"sim:weight":0.499603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8791799,"sim:weight":0.490436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3778,"sim:weight":0.49014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.488409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5166,"sim:weight":0.485074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.484263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707821,"sim:weight":0.48236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9018353,"sim:weight":0.474614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9339941,"sim:weight":0.472977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17178,"sim:weight":0.468098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12836,"sim:weight":0.467553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46347,"sim:weight":0.459676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13131,"sim:weight":0.454532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":326,"sim:weight":0.449785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As a redemptive discourse hip hop versus rap seeks to annex a socially responsible hip hop culture from its popular caricature by culturally exogenous interests. As part of a progressive grassroots, hip hop’s extension into new educational and artistic domains thus marks, at one level, a continuation of longstanding black diaspora struggles around race and cultural cooptation. Correspondingly, a hallmark of its pedagogic practices on the ground is a continuous reflexive commentary on the progressive uses to which hip hop can and should be put. These new hip hop practices, moreover, are philosophically and politically heterogeneous with respect to their sources, motives, and output. Hip hop versus rap can equally serve racial absolutism and mysticism, on the one hand, and, on the other, an avowed commitment to artistic and pedagogic innovation troubling fixed cultural and ethnic borders. Of equal significance, however, hip hop’s ‘communitarian’ ‘grassroots’ turn is also related to emerging forms of municipal and state sponsorship. In conditions of social risk and individualisation youth and educational services are seen as needing as far as possible to be fashioned around the cultural dispositions and preferences of their ‘at-risk’ users - or consumers. This means that another signal feature of hip hop versus rap – particularly as an educational project – is the way in which it marks a convergent point of vernacular cultural politics and histories and historically novel approaches by the state to the support, control and regulation of problem youth.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2010-09-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99032,"sim:weight":0.76399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225489,"sim:weight":0.682646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187643,"sim:weight":0.657806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":874434,"sim:weight":0.630063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383497,"sim:weight":0.470431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5837466,"sim:weight":0.468301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.447795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664572,"sim:weight":0.398444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45121,"sim:weight":0.395518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.39376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9425365,"sim:weight":0.392283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.389866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":114355,"sim:weight":0.389287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":951711,"sim:weight":0.388756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.381843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17178,"sim:weight":0.37884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1028675,"sim:weight":0.377517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710092,"sim:weight":0.377329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.377121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98489,"sim:weight":0.376498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I argue that they find it difficult to be both British and Bangladeshi and are presented with difficult identity choices. Marginalised by mainstream British society due to ethno-cultural differences, many are also excluded from the Bangladeshi community due to their adoption of a seemingly more Western lifestyle. \r\n\r\nThis complex situation brings into sharp focus the question of identity or identities. \r\nAre British born third generation Bangladeshis:\r\n• Bangladeshi ?\r\n• British ?\r\n• Muslim ?\r\n• A fusion of the three ?\r\n\r\nThe central argument of this study is that this dual exclusion from both wider British society and Bangladeshi culture has forced many third generation Bangladeshis to seek alternative identities.\r\n\r\nIn modern geo-politics, the emergence of Islam as a powerful mobilising entity for its followers, has led to the growth of religiously orientated identities in many younger generations across the Muslim diaspora. Numerous third generation Bangladeshis from Tower Hamlets have syncretised their Bangladeshi culture with their Western socialisation within an Islamic framework. The result is the construction of what I have termed a Br-Islamic identity. Enabling the subjects to identify comfortably with their multifaceted identities, Br-Islam challenges traditional Bangladeshi norms, values and rituals and also contests the complex notion of what it means to be ‘British’. Br-Islam allows many to be British, Bangladeshi and Muslim all at the same time, thus occupying more of a socio-political rather than theological space in wider society.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as a dynamic and complex postmodern identity, Br-Islam requires a constantly changing view of ‘self’, responding to rapid social, economic and technological changes in modern society. I argue that Br-Islam is a fluid response to this crisis – a hybrid concept negotiating the complexities of modern society and providing its members with the voice, visibility, belonging, representation and confidence to partake in the wider political process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hoque, Aminul"],"dc:date":"2010-10-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2709893,"sim:weight":0.716377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.714634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.713641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090427,"sim:weight":0.66118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790273,"sim:weight":0.658942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":599526,"sim:weight":0.636411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43809,"sim:weight":0.634231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383641,"sim:weight":0.620613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43649,"sim:weight":0.619584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5760942,"sim:weight":0.613293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48328,"sim:weight":0.604179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090481,"sim:weight":0.595882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48394,"sim:weight":0.585236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44868,"sim:weight":0.584816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5760940,"sim:weight":0.583467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43683,"sim:weight":0.580196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.576359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.566837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46755,"sim:weight":0.562134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4152130,"sim:weight":0.561215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

From the contemporary move against humanistic ideals associated already from the 1930\u0027s exemplified contrasting interpretations over an Enlightenment Science of Man and its ambitions. In the 1960\u0027s Michel Foucault\u0027s pivotal approach gave this dispute the perspective of the \u0027death of man\u0027, which this thesis frames in relation to his reading of Kant. This forms a perspective from which to examine Kant\u0027s positive ambitions, as Foucault saw them extending beyond Critique. But a second perspective is taken up through what Gilles Deleuze ascribed to an empiricist tradition subjugated under a vitalism. This is indicated by the \u0027age of Bichat\u0027, the French medical tradition which Deleuze contrasted with Foucault\u0027s \u0027rarefied form of positivism\u0027. A genealogical history of the Science of Man frames these as alternative models to a critique of reason, two perspectives derived of the Enlightenment project.\r\n\r\nThe \u0027age of Bichat\u0027 is understood around the French Enlightenment discourse on vitalism modelled on a post-Cartesian concept of the body. This gave the positive ambitions for early 19th century Positivism explored through Saint Simon\u0027s \u0027concept of labour\u0027 and August Comte\u0027s epistemological critique, intended as substitute for an older Enlightenment model. However, this becomes further complicated by the new positive paradigm of experimental medicine. The effect, during the early Third Republic, was to re-orientate the philosophical perspective on the older project for a Science of Man. This served Henri Bergson\u0027s critique of Positivist historical formations, but also the neo-Positive model of Emile Durkheim and the ambition for an autonomous new science that delimits a collective \u0027order of things\u0027. The dilemma was legitimating vital norms in a modern society. This genealogy situates these as perspectives seen through the 18th century Science of Man from which the vital and the positive remained elements historically resistant to being the determinable object of study.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brooks, Robin"],"dc:date":"2010-08-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1386225,"sim:weight":0.677675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108286,"sim:weight":0.636472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101106,"sim:weight":0.58634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383926,"sim:weight":0.575758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45682,"sim:weight":0.56609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":898744,"sim:weight":0.548316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352155,"sim:weight":0.545145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352136,"sim:weight":0.538472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.531743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040033,"sim:weight":0.529524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109209,"sim:weight":0.528955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778559,"sim:weight":0.526823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102733,"sim:weight":0.523635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":725151,"sim:weight":0.520258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108759,"sim:weight":0.514173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108751,"sim:weight":0.513246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3144,"sim:weight":0.506696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101381,"sim:weight":0.504169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9537339,"sim:weight":0.503693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108318,"sim:weight":0.503596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It considers the body of literature written about ex-Yugoslavia since the 1990s Balkan conflicts by exiled writers from the region which has entered the international literary canon. Books’ routes from original publishers into English translation are discussed through practices of trust, one of the crucial social devices underpinning their exchange. Within these cross-cultural processes, the role of cultural brokers is crucial. Symbolic and cultural resources are specifically mobilised through their powerful author brands.\r\n\r\nBy exploring authenticity in the context of book publishing, I further look at how ideas and practices of community are employed and negotiated by writers and those who promote their books. My field is multi-sited and fluid, reflecting how different individual and national positions are enacted and performed through strategies ranging from unconscious dispositions to deliberate intentions. This research thus brings together ideas of the author as an authentic, representative voice together with exile as a position that grants them a new lease of relevancy in the post-socialist context.\r\n\r\nAlthough ex-Yugoslav books occupy a ‘high end’ niche of the UK market, constrained by commercial as well as political, cultural, and institutional forces, in public discourse ideas of the ‘free market’ and ‘free speech’ are mobilised to produce various types of modernisation narratives. The (post)socialist production of literature is perceived as having to ‘evolve’ into a capitalist model: this would allow not only healthy competition and consumer choice but guarantee an individual writer ‘free speech’ as a basic human right. Therefore, the most general question this research raises is what kind of foreign literature gets translated into English, under what socio-cultural conditions and which politics of representation it serves within the project of world literature.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pisac, Andrea"],"dc:date":"2010-10-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.621248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.594944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197509,"sim:weight":0.592528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43495,"sim:weight":0.584073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382971,"sim:weight":0.583548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46636,"sim:weight":0.583503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44144,"sim:weight":0.570576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91837,"sim:weight":0.568341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340689,"sim:weight":0.56524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45754,"sim:weight":0.563969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187731,"sim:weight":0.563594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.559337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.556386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197519,"sim:weight":0.554261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":350,"sim:weight":0.552047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145949,"sim:weight":0.5497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98879,"sim:weight":0.549076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.548858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1114746,"sim:weight":0.543469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43450,"sim:weight":0.542422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Specifically, the focus of this study is the penetration of modern mathematical thinking into European avant-garde theatre during the late 19th and early 20th century, particularly as regards the revolutionary experiments on scenic space and dramatic logic that occurred at the time. I will argue that modern European theatre underwent a period of crisis, whereby a number of avant-garde practitioners renounced the axioms of traditional theatre, particularly in relationship to the rule of mimesis,\r\nrepresentation, and verbal speech. Theatres of the Surd argues for a penetration of symbolic languages in the wake of a decline of word-based textuality in the theatre, combined with a cultural shift toward more abstract, technologically mediated and autonomous forms of theatrical practice. This work focuses on three seminal theatre practitioners of the late 19th and early 20th century avant-garde; namely, Alfred Jarry, Stanislaw Witkiewicz and Samuel Beckett, and the impact of non-Euclidean geometry and modern mathematical logic in their work. I will claim that the mathematisation of cultural practices in the late modern era marked a crucial watershed that played an important role in the transformation of the axiomatics of theatrical practice, and the emergence of a truly modern, post-Aristotelian and post-representational form of theatrical praxis. Thus, mathematics may be said to function within the ambit of cultural dynamics, insofar as its penetration into culture discourse and practice has helped modernise the way theatre is conceptualised and visualised.","bibo:AuthorList":["Salazar-Sutil, Nicolas"],"dc:date":"2010-10-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9553258,"sim:weight":0.307509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.190602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.183223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.162466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Therein I argue that, if we are to stall the genocidal machine by which various bodies are reproduced as “killable,” the reinscription of other animals within the domains of philosophy, ethics, and politics remains essential. The interruption of this murderous logic is of the utmost importance, not only for other animals, but also for all those millions of “other” humans who find themselves excluded by the regulatory norms of gender, sexuality, race, and/or class. \r\n\r\nDivided into five parts, and engaging with writers as diverse as Nietzsche, Derrida, Butler, Plato, Heidegger, Kafka, Blanchot, Rancière, William S. Burroughs and Bernard Stiegler, I explore the notion of an originary technicity of being within ever broader levels of analysis. Beginning with the apocalyptic zoo-genesis of an “animal encounter” which exceeds every determinable form, I then consider “improper” tropes which function in the opposite direction to the genocidal theatrics of “animalisation,” calling forth instead forbidden place-holding metonymies which hold open the space of invention itself. From there, I trace the implications of the “zoogenetic demand” through the various overlapping domains of ethics, responsibility, nationalism, community, and biotechnology. This demand, I argue, requires a necessarily exorbitant ethics of the unrecognisable other—of an excessive hospitality from which nonhuman animals cannot be excluded—and without which the privileging of the white Western heterosexual male is inevitably reinforced. In conclusion, I argue that it is excessive mutability which constitutes both the promised posthumanism of vigilant betrayal and at once the poisonous threat of a collapse into absolute nihilism—a pharmakon which must ever again be renegotiated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Iveson, Richard"],"dc:date":"2010-10-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108327,"sim:weight":0.331195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445179,"sim:weight":0.25775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.25704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86055,"sim:weight":0.252504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.233174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443364,"sim:weight":0.192602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Taking as its starting point the consensus view of Richard Yates as a realist operating during a period of strong anti-realist currents in American literature, the thesis seeks to complicate this notion, arguing instead for a reading of Richard Yates\u0027 work as a mode of realism that could only have emerged after modernism, a realism that focussed on a number of concerns and problems regarding representation and interpretation shared with literary postmodernism, and which anticipates recent and current trends within American literary fiction. Its main areas of investigation are Yates\u0027 take on everyday language as a site of entropy; his use of intertextuality, in particular in relation to the short story; tensions between realism\u0027s claim to cognitive/visual authority and epistemological uncertainty; concerns and anxieties around masculinity within American realism; his use of autobiographical material in relation to the psychoanalytic theories of Melanie Klein and D.

And while the thesis begins by demonstrating both the socially and historically constructed nature of spectatorship, and the specific practices that work to create contemporary cinema’s corporeal address, the latter half of the dissertation devotes itself to revealing the regulatory implications of this physical address. That is, the author shows that cinema’s perceived capacity of affect the body of the spectator is a profound source of cultural anxiety. But more importantly, through an analysis of the films Funny Games, Irréversible, Wolf Creek, and the genre of ‘torture porn’ more generally, what is revealed in these final chapters is that the regulation of cinema in the contemporary era is less a question of the institutionalised censorship of texts, and more a question of regulating the ‘self’. In this respect, the author demonstrates the specific disciplinary practices that attempt to present the problem of violent, and sexually violent, imagery not as a textual issue per se, but a question of the formation of appropriate spectatorial relations. Moreover, this study begins the process of teasing out the ways in which the contemporary spectator is induced to see the problem of media violence as one that can be resolved through what\r\nFoucault would term, techniques of the self.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cronin, Theresa Anne"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.744514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.720896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.711889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710584,"sim:weight":0.708215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710586,"sim:weight":0.694304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98480,"sim:weight":0.665311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.663529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780776,"sim:weight":0.658368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709943,"sim:weight":0.648032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70771,"sim:weight":0.645881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98567,"sim:weight":0.638318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.633658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709937,"sim:weight":0.622048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710177,"sim:weight":0.617308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999552,"sim:weight":0.615628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445178,"sim:weight":0.593242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69609,"sim:weight":0.590383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709927,"sim:weight":0.589668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.585959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46502,"sim:weight":0.574263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Secondly, existing investment trait constructs were identified from the psychological literature, and their associations with indicators of adult intellect were meta-analysed. The results suggested that investment was significantly (positively) associated with intellect, and consistently so across traits and indicators. A third study confirmed that the investmen-tintellect association was not confounded by general intelligence but remained significant after controlling for ability.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, investment traits were newly conceptualised in terms of a multifaceted curiosity construct, including epistemic, perceptual and social curiosity. These facets were examined in relation to a newly developed knowledge test, which spanned thirteen domains of knowledge to comprehensively assess adult intellect. The results showed that curiosity was related to knowledge, even though associations varied in their strength and direction across curiosity facets, and they also differed in their relationship to general intelligence. Specifically, diverse perceptual curiosity, which refers to exploratory behaviour in response to sensory (e. g. visual, auditory, and tactile) stimulation, had a positive effect on knowledge independently of general intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the investment theory was supported as an underlying mechanism of intelligence-personality associations, even though the nature of investment was found to differ from traditional conceptions. Specifically, intellect may be significantly shaped by a healthy sense of exploration and a general hunger for experience, which are not necessarily ‘intellectual’ per se.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stumm, Sophie von"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8929418,"sim:weight":0.269222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.144407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.137604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56680,"sim:weight":0.136805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.126235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.114044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It explores original evidence on how they perceive the conditions that enable or inhibit community empowerment to occur, and the factors that influence this process. The investigation references different schools of thought concerning power in relation to local actors’ perceptions. I focus upon the theories of Foucault, Freire and Taylor in particular, exploring perspectives of power as fluid, dynamic and pervasive. These approaches provide the framework for the exploration of the relevance of theory to practice.\r\n\r\nThese debates have relevance to current public policies especially that promoting citizen engagement as part of public service modernisation and civic renewal. The research examines the inherent tensions between policy aims and practical experiences. Theoretical and policy questions are explored through a case study based in Ealing, West London, looking at local issues for a range of experienced activists in the global city. The research timeframe covers five years and includes the use of participatory research methods. The focus is on actors’ understanding, how motivations impact on the strategies employed across the sectors, and the ways those ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ the system adjust to changes. An analysis of participants’ testimonies reveals the contemporary peopled cityscape, and the routes to gaining greater control over the personal, community and political worlds.\r\n\r\nMy thesis points to a shifting terrain within which community professionals and activists navigate, and reveals evidence of considerably more common ground between public policy professionals and community activists than has previously been suggested in the existing literature and current policy frameworks. The ability to adapt to changes in context is exposed as critical, whilst balancing core principles with new priorities. The strategic role of bridging individuals and organisations is identified as an important function providing a crucial and challenging link.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pepper, Rachel"],"dc:date":"2010-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.389877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316484,"sim:weight":0.2993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.285465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.282979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.264852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In my close reading of five novels published since the year 2000, I reflect on the postmodern legacy in the twenty-first century, after the declaration of the death of metanarratives and the concomitant emergence of marginalized voices in late twentieth century. How has fiction in recent years engage with persistent macro narratives in the light of emergent voices? What are the new questions and/or positions that are opened up, recurring issues that are unsettled, or even promises unfulfilled, in these writings with regards to the ‘maturation’ of formerly disenfranchised identities?\r\n\r\nThere are three main areas of contention that I will analyse in my reading of the novels: gender relations, diasporic and local identities, as well as the role of scientific thought in present-day representations of identities, particularly its narratives of Darwinism, genetics and reproduction. They are compelling issues as, despite the postmodern drive to collapse margins and center, they represent instances of recurring peripheral and dominating narratives; indeed, even as familiar power dynamics are challenged or undermined, new ones are born. I will examine in individual chapters the novels’ portrayal of both old and new structures of opposition and power within the discourse of two formerly disenfranchised voices: the female and the colonized/decolonized. Following this will be a chapter on the literary reflection on the hegemonic role of science in our society today. These chapters, as well as areas of overlap within and among them, reveal the ever-increasing complexity and interconnectedness of power relations that demand the intellectual skill, dexterity, and concentration akin to that of a tightrope walker to achieve a nuanced understanding of individual and collective identities in the twenty-first century.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ng, Soo Nee"],"dc:date":"2010-10-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48296,"sim:weight":0.740633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108361,"sim:weight":0.734014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.728752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710348,"sim:weight":0.727374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176807,"sim:weight":0.717981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43450,"sim:weight":0.709747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710015,"sim:weight":0.708858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.705468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98806,"sim:weight":0.684383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382771,"sim:weight":0.682625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85453,"sim:weight":0.67781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99497,"sim:weight":0.675239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":350,"sim:weight":0.673115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2496,"sim:weight":0.662667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48231,"sim:weight":0.65757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197509,"sim:weight":0.656917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":114355,"sim:weight":0.65283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91837,"sim:weight":0.652816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1060296,"sim:weight":0.651179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710092,"sim:weight":0.64604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It explores how the new government formulated and delivered the policy, and how the teachers put creative education into classroom practice. The analysis presented here consists of a critical analysis of the creative education policy agenda, a survey of how three types of respondents (teachers, students, and parents) perceive creativity, and an investigation of the dilemmas faced by teachers and students in developing creativity in the classroom. \r\n\r\nA number of arguments are presented. Firstly, this thesis highlights that creativity has been redefined as a crucial element for education reform in response to the rise of the knowledge economy in Taiwan. I suggest that this economic-led discourse and the short sighted plan have led to misunderstandings of what creativity means. Regarding strategies for policy delivery, I suggest that the role given to policy-makers and their limited experience in developing proper methods has led to more confusion for the teachers. I also suggest that the development of a more liberal and creative education environment has been constrained by entrenched institutional and socio-cultural limitations. I then indicate how these limitations and school cultures have influenced the respondents‟ perceptions of creativity and of teaching and learning in the classroom. Finally, I suggest that creativity in the classroom involves multiple ways of interaction between all participants. \r\n\r\nThis research makes three contributions. Conceptually, I combine various psychological, educational, and sociological approaches to discussions of creativity. Methodologically, I develop multilayered methods and visual analytical frameworks for researching creative education. Empirically, I provide dynamic stories about the practice of creativity in the classroom within the Taiwanese context. This thesis provides a political and socio-cultural angle from which see the limitations on developing creative education in Taiwan.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chiu, Shu-yi"],"dc:date":"2010-11-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Not only do people differ greatly from one another in their individual research fields, but one’s whole method of working changes at different stages for the same individual. Looking back as I end my time as a postgrad student, only one thing has remained constant: the future is always unpredictable. The Ph.D. process is like a military operation, and it is said that no military plan survives first contact with the enemy. This is just as true when applied to a research plan and its contact with scientific reality.  \r\n\r\nThreatened by all this uncertainty, one piece of advice that I found helpful was, to find an area in which you can start doing original work at an early stage. Ph.D. examiners are looking for work of publishable quality, and besides, it is very motivating to know that you are exploring a new piece of science. Finding such an area may appear daunting, but I have found that this impression can be mistaken. However, it is necessary to be prepared for the possibility that your first effort may be a false start, and to change direction if necessary. Science, like warfare, requires flexibility and the humility sometimes to admit defeat: a strategic withdrawal, or at least a change of direction, may be essential.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allen, Rory"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.335453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.331731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.331509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86009,"sim:weight":0.312724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58839,"sim:weight":0.308346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27100,"sim:weight":0.305542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60331,"sim:weight":0.300187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108440,"sim:weight":0.299664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108831,"sim:weight":0.299281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108900,"sim:weight":0.293828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.284833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60325,"sim:weight":0.276858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57364,"sim:weight":0.240096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Together with Božo Banac, his stepfather, Ivanović had already put almost half of their mercantile fleet at the disposal of the British by 4 September 1939. When Yugoslavia briefly joined the Axis on 25 March 1941, Ivanović placed the rest of the fleet under the British command, defying his government. Following the pro-Allied coup d\u0027état in Belgrade on 27 March 1941, Ivanović played an instrumental role in organizing Yugoslav shipowners whose fleets remained in neutral waters into a Yugoslav Shipping Committee. The case of Vane Ivanović suggests that history of the resistance among Yugoslavs cannot be reduced to that of Tito or Mihailović, nor can it be limited to the years of occupation (1941-45).","bibo:AuthorList":["Djokic, Dejan"],"dc:date":"2001-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1445648,"sim:weight":0.148982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108960,"sim:weight":0.128425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316475,"sim:weight":0.123987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.12142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29418,"sim:weight":0.120434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108295,"sim:weight":0.116405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108150,"sim:weight":0.110836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316357,"sim:weight":0.106051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108545,"sim:weight":0.105793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108415,"sim:weight":0.10114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.0983772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The intensity and time scale at which this occurs is critical towards survival. Previous work has observed that the neurochemical and neuroelectric (EEG) operation of specific functional systems is upregulated during so-called ‘activated’ states of behaviour. Thus it has recently been shown that artificial (i.e. exogenous) stimulation of such systems via pharmacological or electrical means can successfully modulate as well as enhance learning and associated behavioural performance. We hypothesized that neurofeedback, which is implemented through non-invasive volitional control of electrocortical rhythms (EEG), offers an alternate and natural (i.e. endogenous) way to modulate and thereby stimulate analogous systems. \r\n\r\nStudy 1 shows that neurofeedback is a viable and beneficial method for improving the acquisition and performance of perceptuo-motor skills in trainee microsurgeons, when compared to a wait-list control group. With the aid of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), Study 2 demonstrates for the first time that 30 minutes of a single neurofeedback session directly leads to a robust and correlated change in corticomotor plasticity which is usually associated with learning or observed after exogenous stimulation. Lastly, Study 3 investigates the short-term modulation of one session of‘excitatory’ neurofeedback on the subsequent performance of a serial reaction-time task (SRTT), an experimental paradigm widely used as a model for procedural perceptuo-motor learning. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this thesis contributes original evidence of direct as well as long-term functional enhancements following EEG neurofeedback, and supports its use as a safe, non-invasive and natural method for improving human perceptuo-motor performance and learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ros, Tomas"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":80918,"sim:weight":0.199103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.17207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87106,"sim:weight":0.163339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.161514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26814,"sim:weight":0.156692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.146191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.145202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26676,"sim:weight":0.0912122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.0894654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The thesis reads the texts within the context of Caribbean literature and challenges the trend in Rhys’ criticism that segregates her from black Caribbean writers. Positioning Rhys in relation to both her Caribbean male and female contemporaries, I argue for the contexualising of her fiction in the body of Caribbean literature. I also seek to unveil links between Rhys and black Caribbean women writers through a shared critique of gender and I offer a contrapuntal reading of Rhys’ texts as Caribbean literature. \r\n\r\nBeginning with a consideration of Rhys’ texts in relation to both European modernists’ and surrealists’ texts, I emphasise her different perspective on the cultural ‘other’. I see this difference as crucial when examining her relationship with Caribbean modernism, notably with the Negritude movement. Rhys’ texts are contrasted to works of specific Negritude writers, notably Claude McKay and Aimé Césaire, who were both deeply influenced by modernist aesthetics. Rhys’ texts are compared to those of Negritude women writers such as Suzanne Lacascade and Mayotte Capécia, especially in relation to their shared challenge to patriarchy and resisting the notion of essentialist racial categories. A similar comparison is made in the context of the Caribbean Literary Renaissance specifically in relation to the BBC’s Caribbean Voices and the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) in London. Rhys’ ambivalence towards national identity as well as to Western feminism is compared to Una Marson’s radical feminism, analysed in view of Sylvia Wynter’s theoretical insights. Finally Wide Sargasso Sea is mapped against Rhys’ contemporary Caribbean male writers’ rewriting of The Tempest, demonstrating that Rhys’ rewriting of Jane Eyre is an articulation of Caribbean feminism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saito, Midori"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

All address aspects of the composer’s output in the context of his life and cultural milieu. They are thus illuminating from two directions: the uncovering of ‘outside’ stimuli allows us to perceive the motivations behind Shostakovich’s artistic choices, while at the same time the nature of those choices offers insights into the workings of the larger world—cultural, social, political—that he inhabited. Thus his often ostensibly quirky choices are revealed as responses—by turns sentimental, moving, sardonic and angry—to the particular conditions, with all their absurdities and contradictions, that he had to negotiate.\r\n\r\nInevitably for a collection of this kind, a broad selection from the dramatis personae of Shostakovich’s personal drama troop across its pages.

How difference is imagined and addressed is explored through an investigation of the lived experience of museum professionals in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The research is an ethnographic study that utilizes a multidisciplinary theoretical framework, drawing from sociology, cultural studies, social and cultural history, art history, and museum studies, and its methodological approach includes in-depth interviews in Seattle, New York and London, and long-term participant observation in London. An examination of race, diversity and representation, an overview of historical accounts substantiating the development of support for the arts and culture, and an indication of arts policy in the US and UK provide a context from which to view the empirical data. The data makes visible how specific communities are imagined, how projects are developed for ‘targeted’ audiences, and it reveals how conventions in practice continue to perpetuate an air of exclusivity in institutions purportedly open to all. Contrasting and comparing the stated motivations and intentions of practitioners with observed practice illuminates the challenges inherent in transforming words into action. These challenges expose the mechanisms of essentialism, instrumentalism and exclusion that can be exerted in practice; analysis of the process illustrates the complexity of shifting the narrative and culture of the museum, a shift which denotes the evolution in learning and audience development from a civilizing, transmission approach towards a participatory, individual meaning-making approach. This research intends to enhance the understanding of the agency of museum practitioners, particularly during their engagement with difference and external policy mandates, whilst they are concurrently situated in the evolving material and discursive space of the art museum.","bibo:AuthorList":["Keith, Kimberley Frances"],"dc:date":"2010-12-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6487,"sim:weight":0.627747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69164,"sim:weight":0.613151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.608745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999527,"sim:weight":0.605495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5823872,"sim:weight":0.598199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.593215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83133,"sim:weight":0.584798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1036475,"sim:weight":0.56251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.556174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040840,"sim:weight":0.543072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69166,"sim:weight":0.539727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5823865,"sim:weight":0.530164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6490,"sim:weight":0.524065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":223828,"sim:weight":0.513905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1151832,"sim:weight":0.509211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1036473,"sim:weight":0.509085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5824646,"sim:weight":0.507873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.501882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634472,"sim:weight":0.499896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634697,"sim:weight":0.497595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In Experiment 3 ignored base objects only primed themselves in a familiar (upright) view, indicating that priming only obtains when that image makes contact with object memory.

Both the DFA and MSE analysis showed the presence of long-range power-law correlation over time in the ISI sequences. Moreover, we observed that the individual spike trains presented non-random structure on longer time-scales and showed slow convergence of rate estimates with increasing counting time. This power-law correlation and the slow convergence of statistical moments were eliminated by randomly shuffling the ISIs even though the distributions of ISIs were preserved. Thus the power-law relationship arose from long-term correlations among ISIs that were destroyed by shuffling the data. Further, we found that neurons which showed long-range correlations also showed statistically significant correlated firing as measured by correlation coefficient or mutual information function.

Strong decreases in phase synchrony of alpha were found primarily in artists for both tasks. The right hemisphere was found to present higher synchrony than the left in artists, whereas hemispheric asymmetry was less significant in non-artists. In the artists, enhanced synchrony in the high frequency band is most likely due to their enhanced binding capabilities of numerous visual attributes, and enhanced synchrony in the low frequency band seems to be due to the higher involvement of long-term visual memory mostly in imagery.

However, in Experiment 2, their recognition of normal or distorted (“Thatcherized”) faces did not appear to have been affected by their attention to detail as has been suggested for autistic populations. The data are consistent with a cultural/experiential origin for population differences in local processing and suggest that attention to the local and global properties of stimuli may differ for hierarchical figures and faces.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davidoff, Jules B.","Fonteneau, Elisabeth","Fagot, J."],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.47696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.452459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.444226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.444226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.440017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.438251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.438251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.434625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.434625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.398395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6008,"sim:weight":0.36753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6024,"sim:weight":0.36753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733696,"sim:weight":0.344438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.340163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.316604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446687,"sim:weight":0.306544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.280616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.280616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69860,"sim:weight":0.273174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85539,"sim:weight":0.26293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thus, the present study examined Categorical Perception (CP) with a type of visual stimulus not previously used to assess the effect of labels on perceptual judgments. For the animal patterns, the Whorfian view predicted that it would only be the Himba who showed superiority for cross-category decisions as only they have the appropriate labels.

Using a within-subjects design, each training procedure was applied to a different set of 10 previously unfamiliar faces and entailed six presentations of each face. In a “simple exposure” control procedure (SE), participants were given six presentations of another set of faces using the same basic protocol but with no further elaboration. Order of the four procedures was counterbalanced, and each condition was administered on a different day. A control group of 12 patients with similar levels of face recognition impairment were trained on all four sets of faces under SE conditions.\r\n\r\nCompared to the SE condition, all three training procedures resulted in more accurate discrimination between the 10 studied faces and 10 distractor faces in a post-training recognition test. This did not reflect any intrinsic lesser memorability of the faces used in the SE condition, as evidenced by the comparable performance across face sets by the control group.\r\n\r\nAt the group level, the three experimental procedures were of similar efficacy, and associated cognitive deficits did not predict which technique would be most beneficial to individual patients; however, there was limited power to detect such associations. Interestingly, a pure prosopagnosic patient who was tested separately showed benefit only from the part recognition technique. Possible mechanisms for the observed effects, and implications for rehabilitation, are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Powell, Jane H.","Letson, Susan","Davidoff, Jules B.","Valentine, Tim R.","Greenwood, Richard"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Powell, S Letson, J Davidoff, T Valentine and R Greenwood.

One possibility explored was that a choice of a distinctive face as an end-point in a morphed continuum can spuriously produce effects that resemble CP. Such morphed continua provided unequal psychological responses to equal physical steps though much more so in a better likeness paradigm than for forced-choice recognition.

They described them as \u0027good\u0027 shapes and the Gestalt premise has been widely accepted. Rosch (1973), for example, suggested that shape categories formed around these \u0027natural\u0027 prototypes irrespective of the paucity of shape terms in a language. Rosch found that speakers of a language lacking terms for any geometric shape nevertheless learnt paired-associates to these \u0027good\u0027 shapes more easily than to asymmetric variants. We question these empirical data in the light of the accumulation of recent evidence in other perceptual domains that language affects categorization. A cross-cultural investigation sought to replicate Rosch\u0027s findings with the Himba of Northern Namibia who also have no terms in their language for the supposedly basic shapes of circle, square and triangle. A replication of Rosch (1973) found no advantage for these \u0027good\u0027 shapes in the organization of categories. It was concluded that there is no necessary salience for circles, squares and triangles. Indeed, we argue for the opposite because these shapes are rare in nature. The general absence of straight lines and symmetry in the perceptual environment should rather make circles, squares and triangles unusual and, therefore, less likely to be used as prototypes in categorization tasks. We place shape as one of the types of perceptual input (in philosophical terms, \u0027vague\u0027) that is readily susceptible to effects of language variation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roberson, Debi","Davidoff, Jules B.","Shapiro, Laura"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447156,"sim:weight":0.597784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446687,"sim:weight":0.537821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443533,"sim:weight":0.535527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446541,"sim:weight":0.505774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443535,"sim:weight":0.505574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.431942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443252,"sim:weight":0.427147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.425875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.424459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.423279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.423279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.413668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.413668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.410604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.410604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.392937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.390544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85083,"sim:weight":0.389966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.378542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.343464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In contrast to the many varieties of melodic  recognition paradigms frequently used in memory research this sung  recall paradigm can answer questions about how mental  representations of a melody build up in memory over time, about  the nature of memory errors, and about the interplay between  different musical dimensions in memory. Although the paradigm has  clear advantages with regard to ecological validity, Sloboda and  Parker also note a number of difficulties inherent to the paradigm  that mostly result from necessity to analyse ‘dirty musical data’ as  sung by mostly untrained participants. This contribution reviews  previous research done using the sung recall paradigm and proposes  a computational approach for the analysis of dirty melodic data.  This approach is applied to data from a new study using Sloboda  and Parker’s paradigm. This chapter discusses how this new  approach not only enables researchers to handle large amounts of  data but also make use of concepts from computational music  analysis and music information retrieval that introduce a new level  of analytic precision and conceptual clarity and thus provide a new  interface which connects Sloboda’s paradigm to rigorous  quantitative data analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wiggins, Geraint","Mullensiefen, Daniel","Deliege, Irene","Davidson, Jane"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.250095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10739,"sim:weight":0.213826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.210096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84933,"sim:weight":0.183167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.180114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58923,"sim:weight":0.175484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58755,"sim:weight":0.173195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999700,"sim:weight":0.165965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108303,"sim:weight":0.159307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.158149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58823,"sim:weight":0.15366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21218,"sim:weight":0.148287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108579,"sim:weight":0.134081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The idea is to try to study not only the requirements for a computer system  which is capable of musical composition, but also to relate it to human behaviour during the same process,  so that it may, perhaps, work in the same way as a human composer, but also so that it may, more likely, help  us understand how human composers work. Pearce et al. (2002) give a fuller discussion of the motivations  behind this endeavour.  \r\n\r\nWe take a purist approach to our modelling: we are aiming, ultimately, at a computer system which we  can claim to be creative. Therefore, we must address in advance the criticism that usually arises in these  circumstances: “a computer can’t be creative because it can only do what it has explicitly been programmed  to do”. This argument does not hold, because, with the advent of machine learning, it is no longer true that  a computer is limited to what its programmer explicitly tells it, especially in an unsupervised learning  task like composition (as compared with the usually-supervised task of learning, say, the piano). Thus, a  creative system based on machine learning can, in principle, be given credit for creative output, much as  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is deemed the creator of the Magic Flute, and not Leopold Mozart,Wolfgang’s  father, teacher and de facto agent.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wiggins, Geraint","Pearce, Marcus T.","Mullensiefen, Daniel","Dean, Roger T."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85785,"sim:weight":0.339957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.338625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.308241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.303248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.301602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87106,"sim:weight":0.297875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.293955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108179,"sim:weight":0.284036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58823,"sim:weight":0.261004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108303,"sim:weight":0.259843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84933,"sim:weight":0.248457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.23397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We explored the hypothesis that an enhanced local processing style is characteristic  of both art and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by examining local and global processing in  savant artists with ASD. Specifically, savant artists were compared against non-talented individuals  with ASD or mild/moderate learning difficulties (MLD), as well as artistically talented or non-  talented students, on the block-design task and meaningful and abstract versions of the embedded  figures test (EFT). Results demonstrated that there were no significant differences between the  meaningful and abstract versions of the EFT, in any of the groups. This suggests that the primary  process governing performance on this task was perceptual (local), rather than conceptual (global).  More interestingly, the savant artists performed above the level of the ASD and MLD groups  on the block-design test, but not the EFT. Despite both the block-design task and the EFT  measuring local processing abilities, we suggest that this result is due to the block-design task  being an active construction task (requiring the conversion of a visual input into a motor output),  whereas the EFT is a passive recognition task. Therefore, although an enhanced local processing  style is an important aspect of savant artistic talent, motor control also appears to be a necessary skill.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pring, Linda","Ryder, Nicola","Crane, Laura","Hermelin, Beate"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443558,"sim:weight":0.40156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445120,"sim:weight":0.354331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85405,"sim:weight":0.341316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.256863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443555,"sim:weight":0.220824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.206576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445135,"sim:weight":0.183773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914780,"sim:weight":0.171691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.16286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108668,"sim:weight":0.147541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While amusia has been associated with deficits in pitch discrimination, several reports suggest that memory deficits also play a role. The present study investigated short-term memory span for pitch-based and verbal information in 14 individuals with amusia and matched controls. Analogous adaptive-tracking procedures were used to generate tone and digit spans using stimuli that exceeded psychophysically measured pitch perception thresholds. Individuals with amusia had significantly smaller tone spans, whereas their digits spans were a similar size to those of controls. An automated operation span task was used to determine working memory capacity. Working memory deficits were seen in only a small subgroup of individuals with amusia. These findings support the existence of a pitch-specific component within short-term memory and suggest that congenital amusia is more than a disorder of fine-grained pitch discrimination.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williamson, V.J.","Stewart, Lauren"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In total, 16 British amusics and 16 matched controls completed five intonation perception tasks and two pitch threshold tasks. Compared with controls, amusics showed impaired performance on discrimination, identification and imitation of statements and questions that were characterized primarily by pitch direction differences in the final word. This intonation-processing deficit in amusia was largely associated with a psychophysical pitch direction discrimination deficit. These findings suggest that amusia impacts upon one’s language abilities in subtle ways, and support previous evidence that pitch processing in language and music involves shared mechanisms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Liu, Fang","Patel, Aniruddh","Fourcin, Adrian","Stewart, Lauren"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447008,"sim:weight":0.670806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15670,"sim:weight":0.670475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447130,"sim:weight":0.650498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447129,"sim:weight":0.645913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312653,"sim:weight":0.614204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447128,"sim:weight":0.501241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145566,"sim:weight":0.486062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999503,"sim:weight":0.394235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.287824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.285644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.282938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.282938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.27825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.27825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.264331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.264331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.260762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145979,"sim:weight":0.246611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.237418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733696,"sim:weight":0.235188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Psychophysical testing suggests that individuals with amusia have above average thresholds for detection of pitch change and pitch direction discrimination; however, a low-level auditory perceptual problem cannot completely explain the disorder, since discrimination of melodies is also impaired when the constituent intervals are suprathreshold for perception. The aim of the present study was to test pitch memory as a function of (a) time and (b) tonal interference, in order to determine whether pitch traces are inherently weaker in amusic individuals. Memory for the pitch of single tones was compared using two versions of a paradigm developed by Deutsch (1970a). In both tasks, participants compared the pitch of a standard (S) versus a comparison (C) tone. In the time task, the S and C tones were presented, separated in time by 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15 s (blocked presentation). In the interference task, the S and C tones were presented with a fixed time interval (5 s) but with a variable number of irrelevant tones in between: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 tones (blocked presentation). In the time task, control performance remained high for all time in tervals, but amusics showed a performance decrement over time. In the interference task, controls and amusics showed a similar performance decrement with increasing number of irrelevant tones. Overall, the results suggest that the pitch representations of amusic individuals are less stable and more prone to decay than those of matched non-amusic individuals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stewart, Lauren","Griffiths, Timothy D.","Deutsch, Diana","McDonald, Claire","Williamson, V.J."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930924,"sim:weight":0.670806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although it is intuitive to assume that the detection of the discontinuities at an object\u0027s boundaries precedes the subsequent precise representation of the object, the specific underlying cortical mechanisms for segregating and representing auditory objects within the auditory scene are unknown. We investigated the cortical bases of these two processes for one type of auditory object, an “acoustic texture,” composed of multiple frequency-modulated ramps. In these stimuli, we independently manipulated the statistical rules governing (1) the frequency–time space within individual textures (comprising ramps with a given spectrotemporal coherence) and (2) the boundaries between textures (adjacent textures with different spectrotemporal coherences). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show mechanisms defining boundaries between textures with different coherences in primary and association auditory cortices, whereas texture coherence is represented only in association cortex. Furthermore, participants\u0027 superior detection of boundaries across which texture coherence increased (as opposed to decreased) was reflected in a greater neural response in auditory association cortex at these boundaries. The results suggest a hierarchical mechanism for processing acoustic textures that is relevant to auditory object analysis: boundaries between objects are first detected as a change in statistical rules over frequency–time space, before a representation that corresponds to the characteristics of the perceived object is formed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Overath, Tobias","Kumar, Sukhbinder","Stewart, Lauren","von Kriegstein, Katharina","Cusack, Rhodri","Rees, Adrian","Griffiths, Timothy D."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98778,"sim:weight":0.482493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387064,"sim:weight":0.342983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98839,"sim:weight":0.323347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84743,"sim:weight":0.317005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98979,"sim:weight":0.310135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387313,"sim:weight":0.301559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.282797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98904,"sim:weight":0.281998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145566,"sim:weight":0.27513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145979,"sim:weight":0.268367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75916,"sim:weight":0.267587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387384,"sim:weight":0.255896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.235952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.23245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.232216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386404,"sim:weight":0.222896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98981,"sim:weight":0.218654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.208916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.205164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146084,"sim:weight":0.194292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Three key\r\nideas of May ‘68 are related to the ATLG and their relevance to other psychotherapies and\r\npsychotherapy trainings is considered. These ideas are: the importance of the ‘capitalist’\r\nuniversity as an essential terrain in the struggle for social change; the Atelier Populaire’s\r\nuse of art in an anti-capitalist critique of the commodifi cation of art and artist in society,\r\nand the anti-imperialist character of the May events. These ideas are related to the theoretical\r\nbase of the ATLG in the large verbal group literature, Performance Art and to the\r\nwide international membership of the ATLG, creating a forum for engaging with global\r\nissues. To illustrate these points, we give an example of the interface of the political and\r\nthe impact of a real event – the university lecturers’ strike in 2006 – and the learning that\r\ntook place in relation to this through the ATLG. We conclude that through a critical engagement\r\nwith the university within the global terrain of contemporary neoliberalism, the ATLG\r\nprovides a territory that can integrate the political and therapeutic in arts / psychotherapy\r\ntrainings; provide a critique and alternative to the commodifi cation of art and artist and\r\nengage with issues of difference in the globalized market place. The ATLG prepares the\r\nartist / student / therapist / worker to critically engage in the personal and social transformation\r\nof the politics of art and psychotherapy provision in the public, private and voluntary\r\nsectors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Kevin","Skaife, Sally"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":1447075,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Article","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Comparative literature and translation, historical breaks and continuing debates: Can the past teach us something about the future?","bibo:abstract":"When in 1993 Susan Bassnett declared that “Today, comparative literature in one sense is dead”, she saw it destined to be subsumed within translations studies.  More recently, Bassnett has admitted that her prediction has shown itself to have been flawed: “translations studies has not developed very far at all over the last three decades and comparison remains at the heart of much translations studies scholarship.”  Bassnett’s death knoll for comparative literature 15 years ago, like Spivak’s more recent one,  are the consequences of the perceived Eurocentrism of the discipline, and the strong sense that the practices and the ideologies that sustain it require to be radically revised – if not even rejected – in the contemporary, more fluid, post-colonial, globalised world.\r\n\r\nHaun Saussy’s recent diagnosis that comparative literature “has won its battles” may sound rather more positive, but it also contains a stark warning about the discipline’s institutional low status and its risk of dispersion among other more established subjects to which it has contributed methods and an openness of the syllabus that was unthinkable until not very long ago. \r\n\r\nEven before Bassnett had time to revise her earlier prediction, Stanley Corngold had queried the notion of the close relationship between comparative literature and translation studies, remarking instead on their essential difference: while translation means carrying over a piece of foreign language into one’s own, “comparison” means being momentarily without one’s language, not needing to translate precisely because of one’s ability to translate, and thus respecting the otherness of languages and cultures. \r\n\r\nEmily Apter’s recent The Translation Zone: A New Comparative Literature  proposes a mediation of these positions. In her excellent study, translation emerges as the fulcrum of a new vision of comparative literature able to expand towards – to take up Spivak’s terminology – a genuine planetary criticism by pursuing unexpected links between as disparate issues as philology, globalization, war and peace, the web, the genetic code. Two opposite theses mark the two poles of Apter’s argument: nothing is translatable, and everything is translatable; at one end, the radical incommensurability of different languages and of cultural, political, aesthetic systems, at the other, the human(ist) will to find common roots, interests, concerns, and the search for codes that can translate one language into another.\r\n\r\nIt is these lively debates over the relationship between comparative literature and translation on the one hand, and over the present and future of comparative literature on the other, that will form the context and the background of my paper, which proposes to reconsider these positions from different but related angles. What can a historical perspective contribute to our understanding of the relationship between comparative literature and translation in their present predicaments? For example, how can the assumptions of (un)translatability, the relationships between culture/knowledge and power, between translation and imperialism be illuminated by a renewed awareness of  the link between translatio studii and translatio imperii as it was formulated in the middle ages and early modern period to describe the transferral of culture and of power from east to west – (from the Middle East to Greece, from here to Rome, and later from Rome to the Holy Roman Empire, or to the Anglo-Norman court of Britain)? How can the question of the flattening effect of a global form of English be not only reconsidered in the light of the lingua franca of Latin in the medieval world, but also informed by a reflection on the heritage of the medieval mediation of human knowledge through the linguistic sciences of the artes sermocinales, which ensured a form of universal translatability of the known? How have later recoveries of these perspectives, such as Eliot’s rather debatable statement on the easy translatability, and thus the superiority, of a Dante who writes in a recognisable common language because of its proximity to Latin, continued to inform, and to an extent deform, our sense of the human values at the heart of the enterprise of comparing and translating?\r\n\r\nIt will be impossible to give definitive and expansive answers to all these questions in the short time of the presentation, and the aim of the paper is to suggest the widening of the debate on these issues to a broader historical and conceptual framework, and trace some possible directions that this opening up may take. \r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to raise another question to which it may also be difficult to find concrete and pragmatic answers, but which must nevertheless be asked: what practical steps would it be useful for us as comparatists to take in order to continue to promote this “discipline” that continues to be declared dead, or flawed, if not even pernicious for the ideological heritage that it carries within itself, but which somehow carries on, evolves, and continues to fascinate us and push us towards the encounter of the other as equal, but not as same?","bibo:AuthorList":["Boldrini, Lucia"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A shift of critical and creative interest from dramatic theatres to performance began to infiltrate the Northern hemispheric academy in the 1970’s. In the USA, Joseph Schechner (e.g. Performance Theory. New York: Routledge 2003), in the spirit of Grotowski, Brook, Barba and other theatre leaders’ interest in inter, cross and multiculturality, influentially applied sociology and anthropology to reconfigure what ‘performance studies’ could and should articulate beyond a euro-centric cultural frame of reference. Into this brew we must add of course group theatres, ensembles, experimental and devised work by a new post-1968 generation, many of whom were moving beyond the realms of new writing (though this has remained a force for change in some quarters) to find what a non-bourgeois theatre could mean. Liberation movements and their many ‘isms pushed forth new voices and new dramaturgies. Writing about our discipline, in terms of critical theories to describe and interpret developments in theatrical performance in the last forty years (during which the Women’s Liberation Movement emerged), is becoming as heterogeneous, intercultural and interdisciplinary as its practice. It simply had to, in order to keep up.","bibo:AuthorList":["Furse, Anna F. D."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Sci:dentity was a year-long\r\nparticipatory arts project which ran between March 2006 and March 2007. The project\r\noffered 18 young transgendered and transsexual people, aged between 14 and 22, an\r\nopportunity to come together to explore the science of sex and gender through art. This\r\narticle focuses on four creative workshops which ran over two months, being the\r\n‘creative engagement’ phase of the project. It offers an analysis of the transgendered\r\nspace created which was constituted through the logics of recognition, creativity and\r\npedagogy. Following this, the article explores the ways in which these transgendered\r\nand transsexual young people navigate gendered practices, and the gendered spaces\r\nthese practices constitute, in their everyday lives shaped by gendered and sexual\r\nnormativities.

The politics of space  is central to this process.

There are parallel possibilities of tokenism and even of manipulation, here, just as there are parallels around the need for more critical reflection and dialogue. Even if not actually manipulative, participatory evaluation can involve little more than the occasional use of particular techniques from a participatory toolkit. \r\n\r\nThis article draws upon our experiences of evaluating a participatory programme to promote active citizenship in England, starting from our shared commitment to achieve more than this. Building upon principles and experiences of best practice, the aim was to use participatory principles ‘in order to democratise social change’ (Cousins and Whitmore, 1998.7), addressing the challenges of putting participatory principles into practice right from the outset, through to the completion of the final report.  \r\n\r\nWe begin by summarising key arguments from previous debates. This sets the context for the discussion of our case study, as evaluators of this particular programme. Finally, we conclude by reflecting upon our experiences of working with some of the tensions inherent in the processes associated with participatory monitoring and evaluation, identifying similarities with as well as differences from Kate Newman’s conclusions, on the basis of her experiences in the global South.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rooke, Alison","Mayo, Marjorie C."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In contrast, typical individuals display a sophisticated understanding of musical structure, even in the absence of musical training. Previous research has shown that they acquire this knowledge implicitly, through exposure to music’s statistical regularities. The present study tested the hypothesis that congenital amusia may result from a failure to internalize statistical regularities – specifically, lower-order transitional probabilities. To explore the specificity of any potential deficits to the musical domain, learning was examined with both tonal and linguistic material. Participants were exposed to structured tonal and linguistic sequences and, in a subsequent test phase, were required to identify items which had been heard in the exposure phase, as distinct from foils comprising elements that had been present during exposure, but presented in a different temporal order. Amusic and control individuals showed comparable learning, for both tonal and linguistic material, even when the tonal stream included pitch intervals around one semitone. However analysis of binary confidence ratings revealed that amusic individuals have less confidence in their abilities and that their performance in learning tasks may not be contingent on explicit knowledge formation or level of awareness to the degree shown in typical individuals. The current findings suggest that the difficulties amusic individuals have with real-world music cannot be accounted for by an inability to internalize lower-order statistical regularities but may arise from other factors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Omigie, Diana","Stewart, Lauren"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447129,"sim:weight":0.626574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930924,"sim:weight":0.501241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999503,"sim:weight":0.497213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The current study investigated the patterns of brain oscillations during simultaneous processing of music and language using visually presented sentences and auditorily presented chord sequences. Music-syntactically regular or irregular chord functions were presented in sync with syntactically or semantically correct or incorrect words. Irregular chord functions (presented simultaneously with a syntactically correct word) produced an early (150-250ms) spectral power decrease over anterior frontal regions in the theta band (5-7Hz) and a late (350-700ms) power increase in both the delta and the theta band (2-7Hz) over parietal regions. Syntactically incorrect words (presented simultaneously with a regular chord) elicited a similar late power increase in delta-theta band over parietal sites, but no early effect. Interestingly, the late effect was significantly diminished when the language-syntactic and music-syntactic irregularities occurred at the same time. Further, the presence of a semantic violation occurring simultaneously with regular chords produced a significant increase in later delta-theta power at posterior regions; this effect was marginally decreased when the identical semantic violation occurred simultaneously with a music syntactical violation. Altogether, these results show that low frequency oscillatory networks get activated during the syntactic processing of both music and language, and further, these networks may possibly be shared.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carrus, Elisa","Koelsch, Stefan","Bhattacharya, Joydeep"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1446115,"sim:weight":0.191169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69993,"sim:weight":0.178927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85009,"sim:weight":0.165531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.124821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.122783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.109382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69994,"sim:weight":0.0979304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Because of this shared experience of trans-Atlantic slavery and European colonialism, issues of culture and identity are major concerns for African and Caribbean playwrights. Slavery and colonialism had involved systematic acts of cultural denigration, de-humanisation and loss of freedom, which left imprints on the collective psyches of the colonised Africans and enslaved peoples of African descent in the Caribbean. Both experiences brought intense cultural and psychic dislocations which still impact in various ways on the lives of Africans and peoples of African descent around the world. \r\n\r\nAfrican and Caribbean playwrights try to help their peoples regain their dignities by affirming their cultures, histories and identities. The book focuses on the similarities and differences between Caribbean theatre and the theatre of sub-Saharan Africa, showing how identities and cultures are negotiated and affirmed in each case.","bibo:AuthorList":["Okagbue, Osita"],"dc:date":"2009-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Discussion ranges from the local and regional context of the Biennial’s function as part of Turkey’s bid to join the EU, through to a longer theoretical perspective on the critical debates over ‘art and life’, artistic autonomy and heteronomy, and the revival in avant-gardism. The authors propose that the standard accounts of the intimate connection between the commodity and art have become politically counterproductive. They suggest that Marxist analysis needs to develop a more complexly-articulated philosophical reflection on the relation between economy, politics, and art – and between political and aesthetic praxes – if it is to advance its longstanding contributions to considerations of ‘aesthetics and politics’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mabb, David","Edwards, Steve","Day, Gail"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The focus of the research was to explore the children’s musical interests and abilities, the musical provision that was made for them, and the ways in which music might impact upon their wider development and education.  The reports of the parents and carers provided a substantial amount of information and while the data may have been subject to certain biases, the findings nevertheless serve as an important signpost for future research.  The main conclusions relate to the fact that, despite reportedly high levels of musical interest and ability among children with septo-optic dysplasia – consistently higher than in the case of their fully-sighted counterparts – few had access to appropriate music-educational or therapeutic support, compared to many of the comparison group who were able to take advantage of a wide range of musical opportunities.  Within the group with septo-optic dysplasia, the educationally blind children often displayed significantly different characteristics from those who were partially sighted, and level of vision seemed to be a more important factor in influencing musical development than the presence of the septo-optic dysplasia syndrome itself.   It was evident that further research is needed to explore the levels of musical interest and ability in visually impaired children with a range of other eye conditions and syndromes, and to investigate in more detail the important role that music may play in the promoting their wider development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pring, Linda","Ockelforda, A."],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84933,"sim:weight":0.296024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.256536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.249932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.238233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59462,"sim:weight":0.225413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.213982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.149673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

She is interested in our relationship and negotiation with the ‘stuff’ of the world, from the readymade to the handmade, image to objects, the representational to the abstract, playing with value, profile, association and meaning of individual and collections of objects. These objects/arrangements occupy a fluid space, on one hand demanding critical discourse, and on the other its own ambiguous, intuitive logic.\r\nFor this exhibition at Pollen, Laura extends her ongoing fascination and investigation into objects she comes across, from those found in bricolage and craft shops to the objects in and on the periphery of our living and working spaces, such as an arrangement of objects in a shop window or ornaments clustered on a mantelpiece. Thinking about the pile of objects we acquire, borrow and give away during our lives, Laura is interested in ideas and questions around their relational placement and display, where an object can be just as much a decoration, ornament or centerpiece as it is an artwork in a gallery. Objects she makes from everyday and ready available materials, such as tinfoil, clay and expanding foam appear on one hand familiar, and yet equally strange and unfamiliar like prototypes or hybrids. We are encouraged to question our own taste and the value given to these objects, pointing us back out into the world where the strangeness is not so much in the gallery but the objects we come across everyday in our lives.\r\n\r\nSince 1991, Pollen has been welcoming artists of all nationalities, enabling them to realize a specific project or else to pursue personal research.

We predicted that for decisions involving resampling, a sampling bias would be observed before the moment of conscious decision for the like decision only. The results indeed showed a gradually increasing sampling bias favouring the choice (73%) before the moment of overt response for like decisions. Such a bias was absent for dislike decisions.

Why is the use of media other than writing so unusual in sociology, but not in other sciences? The sociology of translation has made the claim that sociology should stay true to its object. Rather than jumping into abstractions, sociology should translate its object step by step. I show, that if this holds, then the sociology of translation fails its own claim to what I call “truth to materials”, because in its practice it engages in jumps in media from objects, such as food, image or body, to text. Instead, I propose to take the issue of truth to materials more serious by engaging, as other sciences, more directly with the senses. What prevents the sociology of translation from doing so is a belief in mechanical objectivity that excludes all other forms of translation except texts. For the case of taste, this suggests to engage in cooking. In the second part of the text I provide an attempt to create such more nuanced translations in the form of a buffet that we cooked as comment to a symposium. Some of the issues that were discussed with the help of the buffet were new kitchen technologies, the relationship between the visual and the olfactory, and the relationship between knowledge and taste.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guggenheim, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.283453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108659,"sim:weight":0.267359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85453,"sim:weight":0.264924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999527,"sim:weight":0.264122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.256689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.251908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.235012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85083,"sim:weight":0.23103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931412,"sim:weight":0.212258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.210323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108175,"sim:weight":0.210173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108696,"sim:weight":0.187579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The concept signals the way in which our corporeal apparatus, the inside, becomes exteriorized in technical objects ranging from most elementary hammers to modern steam engines.

This is evident not only in the publication of volumes such as Liberal Eugenics: A Defence of Human Enhancement by Nicholas Agar (2004), Enhancing Evolution: The Ethical Case for Making Better People by John Harris (2007), or Julian Savulescu and Nick Bostrom’s edited collection Enhancing Humans (2009), but also in the setting up of a number of interdisciplinary groups and workshops on the subject: e.g. the Enhancement Technologies Group at McGill University, first led by Carl Elliott and then by Margaret Lock in the late 1990s; or the Arts and Humanities Research Council workshop on Human Enhancement Technologies held at the Royal College of Art in February 2008.  The issues of enhancement also feature increasingly in wider public debates about ‘our human future’ and the direction of its transformation. Mobilising, unsurprisingly perhaps, experts and non-experts alike, the problem of enhancement is usually articulated via two sets of questions: moral questions over its permissibility, extent and direction; and technical questions over the feasibility of different forms of regenerative and synthetic alterations to human bodies and minds. My article postulates that none of the dominant positions on enhancement within the field of bioethics is entirely satisfactory due to the limited, monadic, pre-technological and non-cultural conception of the human that is adopted in these models. Enhancement therefore becomes for me an entry point into a broader interrogation of the limitations of liberal moral and political philosophy, with its particular set of assumptions about human and nonhuman subjectivity, capitalism and ‘life itself’,  when applied to bioethics.\r\n\r\nCritically engaging with both opponents of enhancement (Jürgen Habermas) and its advocates (John Harris, Nicholas Agar, Nick Bostrom, Ronald Dworkin), I also want to take some steps towards outlining a non-normative ethics of enhancement that sees its human and non-human subjects as always already enhanced, and hence dependent, relational and co-evolving with technology. This latter position will not be used to justify the ‘anything goes’ approach to biological or technical intervention into the human or animal body, but rather to outline a more responsible engagement with enhancement. As such this article will constitute a modest attempt to start thinking about bioethics differently, beyond the more established liberal framework which takes a singular and fixed moral entity – a patient, a foetus, a guinea pig – as the object of its enquiry.  My focus is thus not on how much we can or should enhance, and by what means. Instead, my argument is guided by the following two questions:\r\n(1)\tWhat kind of ethical framework would we need to adopt if we were to concede that enhancement is inherent, rather than external, to human existence?\r\n(2)\tEven if enhancement as such is inherent to humans, are all kinds of enhancements to our bodies and minds equally desirable from a cultural and political standpoint?","bibo:AuthorList":["Zylinska, Joanna"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1567333,"sim:weight":0.304207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176841,"sim:weight":0.288196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108330,"sim:weight":0.284281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.26458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85275,"sim:weight":0.256879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108327,"sim:weight":0.247108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The current study investigated the patterns of brain oscillations during simultaneous processing of music and language using visually presented sentences and auditorily presented chord sequences. Music-syntactically regular or irregular chord functions were presented in sync with syntactically or semantically correct or incorrect words. Irregular chord functions (presented simultaneously with a syntactically correct word) produced an early (150-250ms) spectral power decrease over anterior frontal regions in the theta band (5-7Hz) and a late (350-700ms) power increase in both the delta and the theta band (2-7Hz) over parietal regions. Syntactically incorrect words (presented simultaneously with a regular chord) elicited a similar late power increase in delta-theta band over parietal sites, but no early effect. Interestingly, the late effect was significantly diminished when the language-syntactic and music-syntactic irregularities occurred at the same time. Further, the presence of a semantic violation occurring simultaneously with regular chords produced a significant increase in later delta-theta power at posterior regions; this effect was marginally decreased when the identical semantic violation occurred simultaneously with a music syntactical violation. Altogether, these results show that low frequency oscillatory networks get activated during the syntactic processing of both music and language, and further, these networks may possibly be shared.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carrus, Elisa","Koelsch, Stefan","Bhattacharya, Joydeep"],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1446117,"sim:weight":0.211753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446115,"sim:weight":0.191169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69993,"sim:weight":0.178927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85009,"sim:weight":0.165531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.124821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.122783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.109382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69994,"sim:weight":0.0979304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This essay arises out of a prolonged moment of doubt, a cognitive and affective confusion over the ontology and status of what goes under the name of “man.” Now, that confusion is of course nothing new. It has been inherent to the disciplinary inquiry within the humanities conducted under the aegis of philosophical positions broadly associated with post-structuralism over the last few decades. The early twenty-first century attempts on the part of humanities scholars to turn to a more serious engagement with those hard sciences that deal with different human parts and particles – anatomy, neurology, genetics – have contributed even further to this uncertainty, as has the discovery that the typical signal points of the human such as language, tool use, culture (or “leaving traces”), and emotions are to be found across the species barrier.  Rather than aim at ascertaining the identity of the human/non-human animal, in all its biodigital configurations, what I am predominantly concerned with in this essay is discussing how this transformed understanding of the human can help us not only think better about ourselves and others who may or may not be like us, but also live better with others - machines, humans, and other animals. The emphasis in this investigation falls on the pragmatics of the “how” as much as on the nature of that “we.” My focus here is therefore primarily ethical rather than ontological. And yet the very inquiry into ways of living a good life must be accompanied by the assessment not only of who will do the living but also of who will be involved in the process of judging its goodness, and in structuring a theoretical discourse around our biological and political forms of existence. \r\n\r\nIn a certain sense this essay is an attempt to return to the human “after the cyborg.”  This attempt is underpinned by an intellectual and, dare I say it, personal imperative to find a way out of what I see as the posthumanist impasse of some strands of contemporary cultural theory, whereby the widespread acceptance of the notions of transhuman relationality, interspecies kinship, and machinic becoming by many humanities scholars seems to have diminished the need for a more rigorous interrogation of the singularity of trans-species and intra-species difference. It is thus armed with doubt and singularity as my analytical tools, coupled with the intransigent use of the “I” pronoun which simultaneously undermines and reasserts the humanist pretence of this piece of writing, that I set out to explore these issues. Obviously, there is also a possibility that this posthuman, all-too-human interrogation is just another exercise in narcissism, a desperate attempt to return to the self and hang on to a fantasy of human exceptionalism. In this context, Jacques Derrida’s query, “Is there animal narcissism?,” becomes something of an accusation, aimed perhaps at those of us who are still obsessed by Descartes’ question: “But as for me, who am I?.”","bibo:AuthorList":["Zylinska, Joanna","Cohen, Tom"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85453,"sim:weight":0.419713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108655,"sim:weight":0.404913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108327,"sim:weight":0.391798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.377499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.351544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85275,"sim:weight":0.345879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.345431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.34442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.325685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.314122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Given the prior “strong overall growth” of countries like Egypt and Tunisia, the organization confessed it had been caught somewhat unawares by this turn of events. Wealth, it admitted, could no longer be judged at averaged-out mathematical face value: “the IMF should have paid more attention to the distribution of income, not just aggregate results… [it will] begin incorporating more data on unemployment and inequality into its analysis.”  The eyes of leftist observers might roll here; some “told you so”s over the inadequacy and callousness of neoliberal doctrines of accounting would not be unwarranted. But, beyond such easy, reactive rejoinders, the fact remains that work and wealth allocation have strongly affected the contours of each Arab community’s commitments to revolutionary change, and will continue to do so.

However, as a line of anonymous medieval graffiti warns from its home in Edessa church (once in Syria, now in Turkey, along with a multitude of new refugees): “Time has a habit of exiling chosen persons.”  Such remnants of vandalism represent history at its most illegitimate, some would say anti-social, but, despite this one’s longevity, it still feels timely.

In the case of contemporary Syria, the uprisings against the Arab socialist autocracy may or may not result in the country absorbing greater democracy and neo-liberalism.

Hoyle is a former student, and at  times zealous disciple, of  Francis Fukuyama. His work echoes and  extends the concerns Fukuyama expressed in Our Posthuman Future for the status of human nature in the era of biotechnology and for  the rights of the individual in a threatened liberal democracy. 1 Like  Fukuyama, Hoyle considers himself to be a social philosopher, and  he too is something of a populist. He has sought out three of the  most recent and controversial experiments in biotechnology in  order to dramatise his concerns, and each promises (or threatens) to  change the meaning of human life. Hoyle has chosen open access  publishing because, as Gary Hall points out in Digitize This Book!, it  has the potential to reach a very wide audience while garnering  feedback and creating a market for a subsequent paper publication:  ‘the main priority of most academics is to have their research read by  as many people as possible, in the hope, not only of receiving greater  levels of feedback and recognition for their work, and thus an  enhanced reputation, but also of having the biggest possible impact on future research, and perhaps even society’ (Hall, 2008: 46).  However, the impact of Hoyle’s first draft was not quite what he had  hoped for, and, indeed, expected. Of the three people he interviewed  in connection with the experiments, two are currently suing him for  defamation of character, and the third is still consulting her lawyer.  On the advice of  his lawyer, Hoyle has temporarily withdrawn the  manuscript and its associated links  – including a podcast, blog and  short film on YouTube – from the web.

My research in Herat was wide-ranging, looking into the performance of various genres: urban and rural; folk, popular and art; vocal and instrumental; traditional and modern; professional and amateur; female and male; and also at various forms of religious singing that did not fall clearly into the category of music, such as Sufi zikr, Shiah lamentations and Quranic recitation. The largely separate world of women’s music making in Herat was researched by my wife Veronica (Doubleday, 1988), so that together we more or less covered the whole range of instrumental and vocal performance. When its came to writing the ethnographic\r\nmonograph that was a major output from this research (Baily, 1988) I focused on male professional musicians operating in Herat city.

This chapter will argue that they are worthy of serious consideration because they are the part of a newspaper in which the relationship between reader and writer is at its most interactive.  (Where the letters page is a response the problems page elicits a response). It is its porousness which makes the advice column such a fruitful area of study. The unique two-way relationship of the advice columnists with readers means that, rather than performing, as is usually argued (Beetham 1993:23), a narrowly normative role, newspaper agony aunts can be instrumental in challenging norms. Their ambivalent role in a private, or feminine, space within what has been a masculine institution, places them at the edge of discursive formation. Their position as non -experts arguably gives them a very special significance in the re-casting of discursive boundaries – they are the lightning conductors of social unease. They listen to what has been un-sayable, and in listening and then re-producing these forbidden discourses, they bring them into the realm of the ‘normal’ and sayable.","bibo:AuthorList":["Phillips, Angela","Franklin, Bob"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.217947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.213554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.208183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930219,"sim:weight":0.195794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108175,"sim:weight":0.194271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.190494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.17986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.174861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.166338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.165351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57364,"sim:weight":0.162127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.157097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thinking from the Chinese situation","bibo:abstract":"This article examines Chinese cinema to think further about defining and researching transnational cinema. Can transnational cinema be defined as a theoretical concept and a set of practices? Can it become something more distinct and specific than just a catch-all category for everything that is not national cinema, or a synonym for existing terms? If transnational cinema is to have any value, it needs to be more than just another way of saying international cinema or world cinema. The article analyses the times and conditions in which the term transnational cinema came into use. On this basis, it argues for understanding transnational cinema as growing out of the conditions of globalization, shaped by neo-liberalism, free trade, the collapse of socialism, and post-Fordist production. In other words, transnational cinema is a different order of cinematic cultures and industries from the old national cinema order. It also argues that this is not the same thing as saying that all cinema produced under the umbrella of this transnational order embodies, promotes or supports neo-liberal global capitalism. Indeed, a full understanding of what transnational cinema is requires an approach that understands that the values and operations of global capitalism are contested by other forces within this order that it has contributed so much to producing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Berry, Chris"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931412,"sim:weight":0.442568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":381703,"sim:weight":0.231265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.158707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71882,"sim:weight":0.153842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108085,"sim:weight":0.150642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.146825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.131264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.126457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.101973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.0881966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Castells (2009) contended that social networking sites offer a form of mass communication of the self wherein individuals can acquire a new creative autonomy. Stiegler (2009) and the Ars Industrialis collective believe that the processes of individuation, and of speaking out, hold the key to empowerment, agency, and resistance. In this article the authors offer a critical reflection on the logic of mediated participation promoted by social media through a consideration of the differences between individual and collective forms of mediated political participation. Drawing on ethnographic research on alternative media within the Trade Union Movement in Britain and recent research on the political culture of social networking sites, the authors argue that far from being empowering, the logic of self-centered participation promoted by social media can represent a threat for political groups rather than an opportunity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fenton, Natalie"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.626038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.612495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.527537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.524664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101381,"sim:weight":0.500385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.49504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.488687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.487381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.466759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.463882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.454548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.454411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43503,"sim:weight":0.448951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929869,"sim:weight":0.442891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99153,"sim:weight":0.441394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99817,"sim:weight":0.440796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709946,"sim:weight":0.435505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.428715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.425858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.425858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Farm comprises rehearsal rooms, living quarters, technical workshops, an ante-room to welcome and dine spectators, a magnificent loft-like performance space, and acres of land with trees and a pond. The whole is set against a soft New England landscape, and the Farm\u0027s grounds are the almost idyllic environment for the summer promenade spectacles that, like its more formal productions indoors, provide a focus for locals, sustaining their sense of community and even the myth of community nurtured historically in these parts. In this conversation of 13 and 14 November 2009 (which was extended in August 2010 after The Firebird, the summer spectacle of that year), Stacy Klein discusses how local people support Double Edge and otherwise form a long-term relationship with the company, now visited by spectators as well as practitioners from further afield – Klein\u0027s Polish teachers and mentors among them. Double Edge is a devising company, working with improvisation and free association to form strong visual imagery through pronounced physical movement, which also involves circus skills. This, together with a frequently startling use of objects, is the basis of their magical realism (notably in the unPOSSESSED of 2004, after Don Quixote), a style developed by the company in its rural retreat, and subsequently combined with the tonalities of grotesque surrealism. The Republic of Dreams, for instance, inspired by the life and work of Bruno Schulz, enters the world of vivid dreams, powerful memories, and nostalgic echoes, the whole evoking an evanescent past into which its agile, versatile performers – some singing, some dancing – tune in, like ghosts absent and present in one and the same instance. The two productions noted here are part of what Klein calls a ‘Cycle’ – a grouping of works that have evolved over a number of years as separate pieces, some beginning life as a summer show before they grow and link with the other pieces of a given Cycle, which is almost always a trilogy. Gradual, consistent development is key to the company\u0027s work, as is its belief in a distinct company ethos, which its trainees are invited to share. Maria Shevtsova, who enjoyed the Farm\u0027s hospitality when she talked with Stacy Klein, holds the Chair in Drama and Theatre Arts at Goldsmiths, University of London, and is the co-editor of New Theatre Quarterly.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shevtsova, Maria"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9046784,"sim:weight":0.146668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Researching Media Consumption and Public Connection","bibo:abstract":"There is a key ambiguity in media phenomenology which Raymond Williams expressed better than anyone when he wrote about media as: \r\n\r\n… a form of unevenly shared consciousness of persistently external events. [Media] is what appears to happen, in these powerfully transmitted and mediated ways, in a world within which we have no other perceptible connections but we feel is at once central and marginal to our lives. (Williams, 1973: 295–6, added emphasis) \r\n\r\nWe cannot grasp this paradox unless we accept that media, particularly broadcast media, are important in the phenomenology of everyday experience, something Paddy Scannell’s work has done so much to establish as a dimension of media research. We need, however, a more differentiated view of the varieties and tensions at work within this phenomenology, which we will try to develop by drawing on our recent empirical research1 which asked what everyday media consumption contributes to people’s orientation towards, or away from, a world of public issues beyond the purely private. Through written or spoken diaries produced over an extended period of three months, and interviews/focus groups with participating diarists during a fieldwork relationship lasting up to one year, we tried to understand from multiple perspectives how individual citizens fit media use into their wider practice and how this contributes, or not, to their sense of orientation to a public world. Our research complicates Scannell’s account of how media expand the horizons of everyday life, at least in relation to the public and potentially political dimensions of media consumption.","bibo:AuthorList":["Couldry, Nick","Markham, T."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930219,"sim:weight":0.258739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.237803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85453,"sim:weight":0.229289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109179,"sim:weight":0.215638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.20849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.204198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.20409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.196811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.182588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.179763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57364,"sim:weight":0.164661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Does the implosion of ‘the media’ generate a crisis of appearances for government and other institutions? Three dynamics are considered here — technological, social and political — that are potentially undermining our idea of ‘the media’ as a privileged site for accessing a common world.

Alternative Understandings of the Emergent Space of Digital Storytelling","bibo:abstract":"This article reviews the social potential of digital storytelling, and in particular its potential to contribute to the strengthening of democracy. Through answering this question, it seeks to test out the relative strengths and weaknesses of two competing concepts for grasping the wider consequences of media for the social world: the concept of mediatization and the concept of mediation. It is argued that mediatization (developed, for example, by Stig Hjarvard and Winfried Schulz) is stronger at addressing aspects of media textuality, suggesting that a unitary media-based logic is at work. In spite of its apparent vagueness, mediation (developed in particular by Roger Silverstone) provides more flexibility for thinking about the open-ended and dialectical social transformations which, as with the printed book, may come in time to be articulated with the new form of digital storytelling.","bibo:AuthorList":["Couldry, Nick"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.183396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

With respect to the rise in the 1990s and 2000s of gospel music – whose politics are more pietistic than activist – this article challenges how to ‘understand’ the politics of gospel music taken from a small speech community, in this case the Meru. In observing street performances of a new style of preaching, ‘lip-synch’ gospel, I offer ethnographic readings of song lyrics to show that Meru’s gospel singers can address moral debates not readily aired in mainline and Pentecostal-Charismatic churches. Critical of hypocrisy in the church and engaging with a wider politics of belonging and identity, Meru gospel singers weave localized ethnopoetics into their Christian music, with the effect that their politics effectively remain concealed within Meru and invisible to the national public sphere. While contesting the perceived corruption, sin and hypocrisy in everyday sociality, such Meru gospel singer groups cannot rightly be considered a local ‘counter-public’ because they still work their politics in the shadows of the churches.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lamont, Mark"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.385691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.282993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.282993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In music perception, the confirmation and violation of expectations are critical to the communication of emotion and aesthetic effects of a composition. Neuroscientific research on musical expectations has focused on harmony. Although harmony is important in Western tonal styles, other musical traditions, emphasizing pitch and melody, have been rather neglected. In this study, we investigated melodic pitch expectations elicited by ecologically valid musical stimuli by drawing together computational, behavioural, and electrophysiological evidence. Unlike rule-based models, our computational model acquires knowledge through unsupervised statistical learning of sequential structure in music and uses this knowledge to estimate the conditional probability (and information content) of musical notes. Unlike previous behavioural paradigms that interrupt a stimulus, we devised a new paradigm for studying auditory expectation without compromising ecological validity. A strong negative correlation was found between the probability of notes predicted by our model and the subjectively perceived degree of expectedness. Our electrophysiological results showed that low-probability notes, as compared to high-probability notes, elicited a larger (i) negative ERP component at a late time period (400–450 ms), (ii) beta band (14–30 Hz) oscillation over the parietal lobe, and (iii) long-range phase synchronization between multiple brain regions. Altogether, the study demonstrated that statistical learning produces information-theoretic descriptions of musical notes that are proportional to their perceived expectedness and are associated with characteristic patterns of neural activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pearce, Marcus T.","Ruiz, María Herrojo","Kapasi, Selina","Wiggins, Geraint","Bhattacharya, Joydeep"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9321298,"sim:weight":0.22,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Fragmentation in political culture is fuelled by the rise of identity politics that focuses on consumption not production. Party allegiances and class alliances give way to more fluid and informal networks of action. Postmodern theorists celebrate fragmentation because it allows the recognition of diversity in political desires, acknowledges difference between individuals and debunks the myth of homogenous political units leading ultimately to liberation. But for political efficacy there must be more than the apparent freedom that comes with embracing difference and diversity. This article argues that if we accept the description of society as fragmented, in order to create a viable political community then solidarity is crucial. In a global economy, solidarity can be mediated through new communication technologies but the challenge is to articulate the politics online with actual movements and struggles on the ground.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fenton, Natalie"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447393,"sim:weight":0.839747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.654776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.619466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.608711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.575983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.564407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631263,"sim:weight":0.549682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.544791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709946,"sim:weight":0.535492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929869,"sim:weight":0.528836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.526293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.525804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.512609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101381,"sim:weight":0.504775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631615,"sim:weight":0.502579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631487,"sim:weight":0.499729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.488584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.488584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.48718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.481104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Castells (2009) contended that social networking sites offer a form of mass communication of the self wherein individuals can acquire a new creative autonomy. Stiegler (2009) and the Ars Industrialis collective believe that the processes of individuation, and of speaking out, hold the key to empowerment, agency, and resistance. In this article the authors offer a critical reflection on the logic of mediated participation promoted by social media through a consideration of the differences between individual and collective forms of mediated political participation. Drawing on ethnographic research on alternative media within the Trade Union Movement in Britain and recent research on the political culture of social networking sites, the authors argue that far from being empowering, the logic of self-centered participation promoted by social media can represent a threat for political groups rather than an opportunity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fenton, Natalie"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.604993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.589574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.527463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.496578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.487241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.472039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101381,"sim:weight":0.463484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.462577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.460665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.460665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.451139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631263,"sim:weight":0.442112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929869,"sim:weight":0.441356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99817,"sim:weight":0.41746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631487,"sim:weight":0.414799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.410337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.410222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99153,"sim:weight":0.40706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447821,"sim:weight":0.40262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709946,"sim:weight":0.402472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While new technology is opening up new spaces for the engagement of local communities and communities of interest, and new news spaces are emerging these are far from being adequate replacements for a quality, genuinely local, independent news service.

It presents Habermas\u0027 alternative framework for assessing communication in contemporary ‘actually existing democracies’. The model is then tested with a case study of the UK parliamentary public sphere based on 95 semi-structured interviews with political actors (politicians, journalists and officials). It concludes that parliament today operates rather better, according to public sphere norms, than the public sphere described in Habermas\u0027 accounts of 18th and 19th-century England. Such a finding, on its own, is clearly at odds with public perception. The research accordingly offers two explanations for this disparity and the (perceived) crisis of political legitimacy in UK politics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davis, Aeron"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447421,"sim:weight":0.653335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929828,"sim:weight":0.506151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.483793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.452631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86214,"sim:weight":0.444306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.440292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.420618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108340,"sim:weight":0.395408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.384167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109116,"sim:weight":0.374116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52137,"sim:weight":0.333099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.327796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Findings, based on 100 semi-structured interviews with political actors (politicians, journalists and officials) operating around the UK Parliament, suggest two contrasting trends. On the one hand, more political actors at the immediate edges of the UK institutional political process are being further engaged in a sort of centrifugal movement going outwards from the centre. At the same time, the space between this extended political centre and its public periphery is increasing. This fatter, democratic elitist shift in UK politics may be interpreted as ‘new’ and ICT-driven. It might equally be argued that new media is exacerbating pre-existing political party and media trends in mature democracies which fail to engage ordinary citizens.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davis, Aeron"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447420,"sim:weight":0.653335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.55577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929828,"sim:weight":0.539063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.511072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.458071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86214,"sim:weight":0.444797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.443727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.420538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.414764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.40834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.397151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929842,"sim:weight":0.377179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.357797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.357797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929836,"sim:weight":0.344275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Politicians, artists, film stars, authors and others each gain\r\nprofessional status, in part, based on how consumer-citizens actively respond to media representations of themselves. The linking of media to individual celebrity and symbolic power is now implicit in much writing. Individuals succeed because of their personal charisma (Weber, 1948) and an innate ability to present a media personality that directly engages with large publics\r\n(Ankersmit, 1997; Horton and Wohl, 1993; Pels, 2003; Street, 2003). Alternatively, one’s symbolic image is primarily manufactured by promotional professionals (Boorstin, 1962; Evans, 2005; Franklin, 2004; Hall Jamieson, 1996; Lilleker and LeesMarshment, 2006) and parts of themedia industry itself (Evans and Hesmondhalgh, 2005; Turner, 2004). However one’s public image develops, media exposure then bestows a ‘primary definer’ status on those placed in positions of power thus drawing additional media coverage (Bennett,\r\n1990; Champagne, 2005; Hall et al., 1978, Herman and Chomsky, 2002).","bibo:AuthorList":["Davis, Aeron","Seymour, Emily"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929828,"sim:weight":0.442641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86214,"sim:weight":0.42059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930362,"sim:weight":0.406011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.392939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.384087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.381389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75606,"sim:weight":0.371702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930627,"sim:weight":0.359679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52776,"sim:weight":0.355626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.355081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.35275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.32942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.31281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.310454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.310454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108340,"sim:weight":0.309086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109116,"sim:weight":0.305782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.305503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.297465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52137,"sim:weight":0.289663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Of greater interest here, the interviews also revealed that\r\nsuch relations have come to play a significant role in the micro-level politics of the political sphere\r\nitself.

Consequently, politicians have come to\r\nincorporate such reporter interactions into their daily thinking and behaviour. As such, journalists\r\nare seen as more than a simple means of message promotion to the public.

In so doing, it makes use of Bourdieu’s schema for integrating socio-economic, field-specific, cultural and symbolic factors into discussions of political advancement and power. This framework is then used to interpret empirical material collected from a study of elected politicians at Westminster. This documents and compares the forms of capital possessed by front and back-bench politicians, new and old, in the UK political field. The findings here suggest that the forms of capital being acquired by the newest generation of front-bench politicians, clearly distinguishes them from both the older generation\r\nand from the larger pool of elected MPs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davis, Aeron"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66672,"sim:weight":0.322513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86214,"sim:weight":0.201499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.198925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.178015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316083,"sim:weight":0.176752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.175316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108065,"sim:weight":0.167707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.145699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.14396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is also the cornerstone of an academic career. This book treats the often conflicting demands of academic research projects in four respects; (1) those decisions we all need to make along a certain path that has a point of destination in mind and the implications of these decisions in the longer term: (2) practical and philosophical conundrums, as they emerge along the way, around specific techniques for gathering and then analysing ‘data\u0027: (3) moments of disconnect, overlap, and potentially mutual benefit for researchers working at different points along the quantitative-qualitative divide that underscores popular and scholarly debates about the relevance of academic research: (4) ways of coping with a divide that is both real and imagined; in all its experiential, institutional, and conceptual variations. \r\n\r\nWith coping the key word, this book is  a real-time ‘rough guide’ to conducting academic research. Both theoretically informed and consciously pragmatic it provides research students, and their supervisors, practical and theoretical guidance on how to begin, execute, and communicate the outcome of research projects undertaken at the intersection of the arts, humanities, and social sciences in international and cross-cultural settings. The goal is to provide ways of working through, rather than be stumped by entrenched positions on divisions that can and do matter to the successful completion of an original piece of research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Franklin, M.

Even those without full access, who use the web reluctantly or have unplugged themselves from the global information infrastructure that underpins the disjunctures and differences of the world today still have to work and live with the rest of us who take these facilities for granted. This reflection considers what form and substance a future information society, however defined, might take as if this were purely a problem-solving exercise is to let the tail wag the dog.\r\n\r\nFirst I discuss the way different assumptions about the relationship between technology on the one hand and society on the other underscores deliberations further upstream. The second section looks at how these ideas resonate in popular science fiction; a literary and entertainment genre that provides a productive filter through which to look at ongoing and emerging debates about the Internet and society. The third section returns to live issues; where the Internet, as part of the latest generation of new media has become a focal point for political and social mobilization.  With these reflections I hope to trigger some alternative ways to start thinking futures.

In contrast, diffusion tensor imaging provides a validated and sensitive way of identifying the impact of axonal injury. The relationship between cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury and white matter damage is likely to\r\nbe complex. We applied a flexible technique—tract-based spatial statistics—to explore whether damage to specific white matter tracts is associated with particular patterns of cognitive impairment. The commonly affected domains of memory, executive function and information processing speed were investigated in 28 patients in the post-acute / chronic phase following traumatic brain injury and in 26 age-matched controls. Analysis of fractional anisotropy and diffusivity maps revealed widespread differences\r\nin white matter integrity between the groups. Patients showed large areas of reduced fractional anisotropy, as well as increased mean and axial diffusivities, compared with controls, despite the small amounts of cortical and white matter damage visible on standard imaging. A stratified analysis based on the presence or absence of microbleeds (a marker of diffuse axonal injury) revealed diffusion tensor imaging to be more sensitive than gradient-echo imaging to white matter damage. The location of white matter abnormality predicted cognitive function to some extent. The structure of the fornices was correlated with associative learning and memory across both patient and control groups, whilst the structure of frontal lobe connections showed relationships with executive function that differed in the two groups. These results highlight the complexity of the relationships\r\nbetween white matter structure and cognition. Although widespread and, sometimes, chronic abnormalities of white matter are identifiable following traumatic brain injury, the impact of these changes on cognitive function is likely to depend on damage to key pathways that link nodes in the distributed brain networks supporting high-level cognitive functions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kinnunen, K.

The cross-cultural development of a new measure to assess HRQoL after TBI is described. \r\nAn international TBI Task Force derived a conceptual model from previous work, constructed an initial item bank of 148 items, and then reduced the item set through two successive multi-centre validation studies. The first study with eight language versions of the QOLIBRI recruited 1528 participants with TBI and the second with six language versions 921 participants. The data from 795 participants from the second study who had complete GCS and GOS data were used to finalise the instrument.\r\nThe final version of the QOLIBRI consists of 37 items in six scales. Satisfaction is assessed in the areas of “Cognition”, “Self”, “Daily life and Autonomy”, and “Social Relationships” and feeling bothered by “Emotions “and “Physical Problems”. The QOLIBRI scales meet standard psychometric criteria (internal consistency, alpha \u003d .75 to .89, test-retest reliability, rtt \u003d .78 to .85). Test-retest reliability (rtt \u003d 0.68 to 0.87) as well as internal consistency (alpha \u003d .81 to .91) was also good in a subgroup of participants with lower cognitive performance. Although there is one strong HRQoL factor, a six scale structure explaining additional variance was validated by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and with Rasch modelling.\r\n\r\nThe QOLIBRI is a new cross-culturally developed instrument for assessing HRQoL after TBI that fulfils standard psychometric criteria. It is potentially useful for clinicians and researchers conducting clinical trials, assessing the impact of rehabilitation or other interventions, or carrying out epidemiological surveys.","bibo:AuthorList":["von Steinbüchel, Nicole","Wilson, Lindsay","Hawthorne, Graeme","Gibbons, Henning","Höfer, Stefan","Schmidt, Silke","Bullinger, Monika","Maas, Andrew","Neugebauer, Edmund","Powell, Jane H.","von Wild, Klaus","Zitnay, George","Bakx, Wilbert","Christensen, Anne-Lise","Koskinen, Sanna","Sarajuuri, Jaana","Formisano, Rita","Sasse, Nadine","Truelle, Jean-Luc"],"dc:date":"2010-07-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26758,"sim:weight":0.189175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.179991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388776,"sim:weight":0.173135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.169637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.167225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26084,"sim:weight":0.151108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.140434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

After overnight abstinence they completed experimental tests of cue reactivity, attentional bias to smoking cues, response to financial reward, motor impulsiveness, and response inhibition (antisaccades).  They then started a quit attempt with follow-up after 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months; abstinence was verified via salivary cotinine levels ≤ 20ng/ml.\r\nResults: Relapse rates at each point were 52.5%, 64% and 76.3%.  The strongest predictor was pre-cessation salivary cotinine; other smoking / dependence indices did not explain additional outcome variance and neither did trait impulsivity.  All experimental indices except responsivity to financial reward significantly predicted one week outcome. Salivary cotinine, attentional bias to smoking cues and antisaccade errors explained unique as well as shared variance.  At one and three months, salivary cotinine, motor impulsiveness and cue reactivity were all individually predictive; the effects of salivary cotinine and motor impulsiveness were additive.\r\nConclusions: These data provide some support for the involvement of abnormal cognitive and motivational processes in sustaining smoking dependence and suggest that they might be a focus of interventions, especially in the early stages of cessation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Powell, Jane H.","Dawkins, Lynne","West, Robert","Powell, John","Pickering, Alan"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6197677,"sim:weight":0.614769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26676,"sim:weight":0.566764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632064,"sim:weight":0.500747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632065,"sim:weight":0.500747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222798,"sim:weight":0.477832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197673,"sim:weight":0.398894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710109,"sim:weight":0.347215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.345745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.309339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.303245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76111,"sim:weight":0.301306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.299531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.288519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.287264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.273547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.256343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643975,"sim:weight":0.248088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58663,"sim:weight":0.236958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631760,"sim:weight":0.212575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.205394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The ethnographic research investigated the premise that some children have the opportunity to acquire biliteracy, like their bilingualism, in naturalistic contexts. There are gaps in bilingual studies on the issue of what happens when a single parent or non-residential parent is the focus for support of the minority language, but must also be supportive of the language and culture of the country the children are growing up in, if both languages are to be viewed in a positive light. Previous research has either ignored bilingual children growing up in diverse family structures, or presented these families negatively in terms of children developing biliteracy. My research contradicts these views and shows that single parents are able to promote both languages in the home due to the cross-cultural experiences of the child in the home/community and sibling literacies. A non-residential parent, who is actively involved with a child’s language development, is also able to promote biliteracy in naturalistic settings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Obied, Vicky Macleroy"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.349141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.338808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109179,"sim:weight":0.331556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.311783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109086,"sim:weight":0.258409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.25668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85363,"sim:weight":0.254784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.254289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446416,"sim:weight":0.217107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.212679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57213,"sim:weight":0.208036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper begins by identifying several broad problematics associated with the digitization of social research: the displacement of research capacities away from academic social science, and the rise to prominence of popularity metrics in online research. It proposes that this second problematic implies the resurgence of a classic concern of social and political thought, with the ‘tyranny of reputation.’ In examining how this problematic plays itself out in the digital context, this paper suggest that we may built on previous attempts in sociology to address it, most notably the development of ‘post-social methods.’ The paper goes on to situate this project in relation to four different types of responses to the digitization of social methods: methods-as-usual, big methods, virtual methods and digital methods. The paper takes up the last proposition, but argues that, contrary to the initial framing of digital methods, there may be milage in focusing on the re-mediation of existing social methods in digital environments. It discusses two online tools for social research, Issue Crawler and a second online application for issue analysis currently under development. It shows how these tools re-mediate not only specific methods of network and textual analysis, but also specific methodology critiques. The paper then takes up the STS concept of the ‘re-distribution of methods’ and adapts it to account for this digital form of methodology critique. This concept suggests that the enactment of social research methods involves a range of agencies and agents inside and outside academic research, and, as such, it enables us to acknowledge that digital methods are participatory methods of sorts, and to make more of this fact.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marres, Noortje"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We explored questions with eleven teachers, from both primary and secondary schools, during the Autumn of 2004. Although the cultural/ethnic context of the schools the teachers worked within was diverse, they shared a commitment to working with contemporary art in the classroom and exploring new pedagogies in this field. Their engagement with contemporary art and their revealing and compelling experiences are documented, contextualized and summarized. Samples of the discussions form the substance of this article. This is preceded by an analysis of the success of socially-orientated contemporary art in the wider global context and its contrast with the omission of these practices in many schools. Conclusions have been tentatively drawn about how the curriculum may be better served by the use of contemporary art, as well as the means by which new learning methods may be facilitated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Page, Tara","Herne, Steve","Dash, Paul","Atkinson, Dennis","Adams, Jeff N.

But has the increased commercialization in the media market increased or decreased the flow of political information? Hallin and Mancini stress that the existing empirical evidence is fragmented and that this question therefore has been difficult to answer. In this article the authors present new data that allow them to systematically examine how the flow of political information on TV occurs across six Western countries during a thirty-year period. The authors find that the flow of political information through TV varies according to the degree of commercialization. The flow of news and current affairs is lowest in the most commercially oriented television system and among the commercial TV channels. There is however important cross-national variation even within similar media systems. The authors’ data do not suggest a convergence toward the liberal system when it comes to the political information environment on TV. Rather, what strikes them is how strongly resistant some European countries have been to subordinating the needs of democracy to profit making.","bibo:AuthorList":["Curran, James P.","Coen, Sharon","Aalberg, Toril","Iyengar, Shanto"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43793,"sim:weight":0.552831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.471519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.461509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929828,"sim:weight":0.422599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47193,"sim:weight":0.389213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.388213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.379622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47210,"sim:weight":0.375896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.369847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929836,"sim:weight":0.354385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381915,"sim:weight":0.353742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930627,"sim:weight":0.346514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43503,"sim:weight":0.338157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.333504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.330923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929834,"sim:weight":0.325401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.314986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43428,"sim:weight":0.311287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43662,"sim:weight":0.303936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.294242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Furthermore, the lower rating of Accounting research in the RAE2008 in comparison with Business and Management research in the same year and Accounting and Finance research in 2001, has more to do with the way in which the Accounting and Finance Panel calibrated and normalised its judgements than with the ratings contained within the ABS guide.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morris, H","Harvey, C","Kelly, Aidan","Rowlinson, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1393873,"sim:weight":0.363646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.279885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108259,"sim:weight":0.232728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.211768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.188056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108912,"sim:weight":0.174727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.121553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this conversation, Vassiliev discusses the unique situation of theatre activity in Russia in the early decades of the twentieth century, where the studio, or laboratory, was integral to the very life of the theatre as a specific, collaborative, and ensemble practice and a comprehensive artistic institution. He situates the School of Dramatic Art, which he founded in 1987, in this context, extending the latter\u0027s reach to Maria Knebel and Andrey Popov, who were his teachers on the directing course at GITIS in Moscow (State Institute of Theatre Art, now known as the Russian Academy of Theatre Art). He graduated from GITIS in 1973. Vassa Zheleznova, referred to in this interview, was the acme of Vassiliev\u0027s explorations of psychological realism, after which he developed forms of what he calls ‘play structures’ (or ‘ludic structures’). Actors working in these structures project externally in clearly articulated ways rather than go inwards, towards and within emotional states of being, as is typical of psychological-realist performance in the Russian tradition. Vassiliev\u0027s reversal of established performance modes led to his current preoccupation with ‘verbal structures’, which are underpinned by his understanding of words as ideas oriented to symbolic and metaphysical sense rather than to psycho-emotional interpretation. The spatial and luminary dimensions of play, together with movement, music, and song that is formal, operatic, rather than in any other kind of vein, defines such later works as Mozart and Salieri (2000) and Onegin\u0027s Journey (2003). They have won him great acclaim in Russia and abroad for their innovative approach outside the parameters not only of realism but also of a range of other familiar aesthetic configurations.

Dies Irae was premiered in 2004. Various research projects led by Richards and/or Biagini include Tracing Roads Across (2003–06) and Open Programme, which began in 2007. Such works as I am America, crafted on the poems of Allen Ginsberg, and Electric Party, both directed by Biagini and first performed in 2009, have emerged from Open Programme. A recently ‘finalized’ work, The Letter (2008), directed by Richards, was the result of a long process of development that passed through three major phases and two differently named Actions, starting in 2003. Richards is the author of At Work with Grotowski on Physical Actions (1995) and Heart of Practice (2008), while Biagini has edited, with Antonio Attisani, the three-volume Opere e Sentiere (2007 and 2008). The conversation below is an edited version, in consultation with Richards and Biagini, of their discussion with Maria Shevtsova in November 2008, as part of her ‘Conversations’ series at Goldsmiths, University of London. These last pupils of Grotowski give uncommon insight into the processes of their work together, continuing their generous and open reflections in their responses to questions from members of the audience.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shevtsova, Maria"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447525,"sim:weight":0.742002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Such instruments are currently put forward, in the UK and elsewhere, as a way of locating environmental engagement in everyday practices, such as cooking and heating. The paper considers whether and how these technologies can be said to ‘materialise’ public participation. It argues that the materialisation of\r\nengagement entails a particular codification of it: as participation is located in everyday material practice, it comes to be defined in terms of its doability and the investment of effort. Material participation, then, does not just refer to its mediation by things: it involves the deployment of specific legitimatory tropes associated with liberal theories of citizenship and the domestication of technology, in particular the notion that the engagement of everyday subjects requires things to be ‘made easy’ (Pateman, 1989; Schwartz Cowan, 1983). To make sense of this confluence of political and technological ideals, the paper takes up the notion of ‘co-articulation’ (Callon, 2009). A distinctive feature of the everyday devices of accounting under consideration here, I argue, is their ability to ‘co-articulate’ participation with other registers: those of innovation and economy. In this respect, the spaces of participation organised with the aid of these technologies can be qualified as spaces of ‘multi-valent’ action. Different carbon accounting devices do this, however, in different ways, and this has consequences for how we understand the wider normative implications of the ‘materialisation’ of environmental participation. In some cases, materialisation entails the minimisation of social, material and political changes, while in others it enables the exploration and amplification of precisely these modes of change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marres, Noortje"],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Set against the background of post-Foucaldian perspectives on the material dimensions of citizenship and engagement - perspectives that treat matter as a tacit, constituting force in the organization of collectives and are predominantly concerned with the fabrication of political subjects - we outline an approach that considers material engagement as a distinct mode of performing the public. The question, then, is how objects, devices, settings and materials acquire explicit political capacities, and how they serve to enact material participation as a specific public form. We discuss the connections between social studies of material participation and political theory, and define the contours of an empiricist approach to material publics, one that takes as its central cue that the values and criteria particular to these publics emerge as part of the process of their organization. Finally, we discuss four themes that connect the articles in this special section, namely their focus on 1) mundane technologies, 2) experimental devices and settings for material participation; 3) the dynamic of effort and comfort, and 4) the modes of containment and proliferation that characterize material publics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marres, Noortje","Lezaun, Javier"],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.478971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109122,"sim:weight":0.463614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109078,"sim:weight":0.439778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.431386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.422784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.422784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.372436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543412,"sim:weight":0.252428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While global forums are widely attributed the capacity to put in place the conditions for the resolution of local issues, at the same time these sites are seen to place unacceptable restrictions on the articulation of the issues from localist perspectives. ICTs occupy a special position with respect to this dilemma, as they are both seen to be part of the problem, a factor in the enrolment of NGOs in global governance networks, and part of the solution, as instruments of alternative, translocal forms of political organisation. This piece shows how a particular style of Web analysis, informed by actor-network theory, demonstrates the need to complicate certain assumptions that inform both these critical and constructive perspectives. In a series of exercises of network analysis on the Web, we open up for questioning the assumption of the ‘primacy of the local’ on which these perspectives tend to rely. We suggest that the role of ICTs in the globalisation of NGO practices should rather be understood in terms of the reformatting of issues for transnational networks. In our interpretations of issue networks on the Web, we argue for the importance of taking more seriously the ways in which the Web highlights the practical constraints on issue articulation faced by NGOs. By way of conclusion, this paper draws attention to the fact that Web studies present a notable extension to the sites studied by actor-network theory and related approaches in assemblages studies, as it compels consideration of the media circulations characteristic of publicity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marres, Noortje","Rogers, Richard"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, most classifications change in absolute terms in that some die whilst others are created, and in their meaning. There is a need, therefore, to re-think how longitudinal quantitative research might explore both the qualitative changes to classification systems as well as the quantitative changes within each classification. By drawing on the changing classifications of local food retail outlets in the city of York (UK) since the 1950s as an illustrative example, an alternative way of graphing longitudinal quantitative data is presented which ultimately provides a description of both types of change over time. In so doing, the article argues for the increased use of ‘dirty data’ in longitudinal quantitative analysis, which allows for both qualitative and quantitative changes to and within classification systems to be explored. This ultimately challenges existing assumptions relating to the quality and type of data used in quantitative research and how change in the social world is measured in general.","bibo:AuthorList":["Uprichard, E"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108945,"sim:weight":0.259005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.234147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.195182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176853,"sim:weight":0.189079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.175549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.171908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.168106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.164116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.141508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It engages with object-centred perspectives in the sociology of science and technology, which have characterized public experiments as sites for the domestication of technology, and as effective instruments of public involvement, because, in part, of the seductive force of their use of empirical forms of display. Green living experiments, which are conducted in the intimate setting of the home and reported on blogs, complicate this understanding, insofar as they seek to format socio-material practices as sites of involvement. This has implications for how we conceive of the relations between these two phenomena. While socio-material practices are often located outside the public sphere, green living experiments extend the publicity genre of ‘being intimate in public’ to things.

Brodsky was detained in the notorious Escuela de la Armada (ESMA) in Buenos Aires, and remains disappeared. The negative of the photograph was smuggled out of ESMA and the image became part of a bundle of photographic evidence submitted by families of the disappeared during the trials of the military after the return to democracy in 1983. This article seeks to under- stand the vitality of the photograph, the different courses it takes, the archives it joins and leaves, asking: ‘What sort of life can the photograph have? What sort of desire? What sort of politics?’ The article proposes that we might consider the role of such images ‘biopolitically’, which is to say in the context of the relations established through the attempts to govern populations in times of military rule and in times of transitional democracy. The re-appearance of Fernando in the photograph is part of post-dictator- ship politics in which the demand ‘aparición’ resounds. Fernando, an absolute witness who does not, who cannot, speak nevertheless re-appears in the law courts and in art exhibitions. The article considers the difference between the photograph’s appearance as evidence and its reappearance in the art galleries, arguing that its ‘desires’ can be imagined differently in each. The article argues that while the photograph does not escape archives tout court, in raising the question of how it should be filed, it prompts reflec- tion on the biopolitical present, with its inequitable distribution of life and security among populations. This is a politics of the present, more than it is a politics of memory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bell, Vikki"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The Farm comprises rehearsal rooms, living quarters, technical workshops, an ante-room to welcome and dine spectators, a magnificent loft-like performance space, and acres of land with trees and a pond. The whole is set against a soft New England landscape, and the Farm\u0027s grounds are the almost idyllic environment for the summer promenade spectacles that, like its more formal productions indoors, provide a focus for locals, sustaining their sense of community and even the myth of community nurtured historically in these parts. In this conversation of 13 and 14 November 2009 (which was extended in August 2010 after The Firebird, the summer spectacle of that year), Stacy Klein discusses how local people support Double Edge and otherwise form a long-term relationship with the company, now visited by spectators as well as practitioners from further afield – Klein\u0027s Polish teachers and mentors among them. Double Edge is a devising company, working with improvisation and free association to form strong visual imagery through pronounced physical movement, which also involves circus skills. This, together with a frequently startling use of objects, is the basis of their magical realism (notably in the unPOSSESSED of 2004, after Don Quixote), a style developed by the company in its rural retreat, and subsequently combined with the tonalities of grotesque surrealism. The Republic of Dreams, for instance, inspired by the life and work of Bruno Schulz, enters the world of vivid dreams, powerful memories, and nostalgic echoes, the whole evoking an evanescent past into which its agile, versatile performers – some singing, some dancing – tune in, like ghosts absent and present in one and the same instance. The two productions noted here are part of what Klein calls a ‘Cycle’ – a grouping of works that have evolved over a number of years as separate pieces, some beginning life as a summer show before they grow and link with the other pieces of a given Cycle, which is almost always a trilogy. Gradual, consistent development is key to the company\u0027s work, as is its belief in a distinct company ethos, which its trainees are invited to share. Maria Shevtsova, who enjoyed the Farm\u0027s hospitality when she talked with Stacy Klein, holds the Chair in Drama and Theatre Arts at Goldsmiths, University of London, and is the co-editor of New Theatre Quarterly.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shevtsova, Maria"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9046784,"sim:weight":0.146668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this conversation, Vassiliev discusses the unique situation of theatre activity in Russia in the early decades of the twentieth century, where the studio, or laboratory, was integral to the very life of the theatre as a specific, collaborative, and ensemble practice and a comprehensive artistic institution. He situates the School of Dramatic Art, which he founded in 1987, in this context, extending the latter\u0027s reach to Maria Knebel and Andrey Popov, who were his teachers on the directing course at GITIS in Moscow (State Institute of Theatre Art, now known as the Russian Academy of Theatre Art). He graduated from GITIS in 1973. Vassa Zheleznova, referred to in this interview, was the acme of Vassiliev\u0027s explorations of psychological realism, after which he developed forms of what he calls ‘play structures’ (or ‘ludic structures’). Actors working in these structures project externally in clearly articulated ways rather than go inwards, towards and within emotional states of being, as is typical of psychological-realist performance in the Russian tradition. Vassiliev\u0027s reversal of established performance modes led to his current preoccupation with ‘verbal structures’, which are underpinned by his understanding of words as ideas oriented to symbolic and metaphysical sense rather than to psycho-emotional interpretation. The spatial and luminary dimensions of play, together with movement, music, and song that is formal, operatic, rather than in any other kind of vein, defines such later works as Mozart and Salieri (2000) and Onegin\u0027s Journey (2003). They have won him great acclaim in Russia and abroad for their innovative approach outside the parameters not only of realism but also of a range of other familiar aesthetic configurations. Vassiliev has directed productions in various countries in Europe, and has also conducted prolonged research workshops as well as working demonstrations there. In this conversation, which took place in June 2009, Vassiliev refers to several underlying principles of his work and reflects upon the importance to him of Grotowski, his last mentor.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shevtsova, Maria"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Dies Irae was premiered in 2004. Various research projects led by Richards and/or Biagini include Tracing Roads Across (2003–06) and Open Programme, which began in 2007. Such works as I am America, crafted on the poems of Allen Ginsberg, and Electric Party, both directed by Biagini and first performed in 2009, have emerged from Open Programme. A recently ‘finalized’ work, The Letter (2008), directed by Richards, was the result of a long process of development that passed through three major phases and two differently named Actions, starting in 2003. Richards is the author of At Work with Grotowski on Physical Actions (1995) and Heart of Practice (2008), while Biagini has edited, with Antonio Attisani, the three-volume Opere e Sentiere (2007 and 2008). The conversation below is an edited version, in consultation with Richards and Biagini, of their discussion with Maria Shevtsova in November 2008, as part of her ‘Conversations’ series at Goldsmiths, University of London. These last pupils of Grotowski give uncommon insight into the processes of their work together, continuing their generous and open reflections in their responses to questions from members of the audience.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shevtsova, Maria"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447525,"sim:weight":0.742002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6177295,"sim:weight":0.267711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Through the concept of ‘biopower’, this approach was among the first in sociology to highlight the general relevance of health to the constitutive dynamics of modern (and eventually late-modern) societies. Through the concept of ‘governmentality’, scholars in a range of disciplines offered early critical analyses of health promotion discourse in the specific context of neo-liberalism, highlighting some of its paradoxical features. To the extent that such paradoxes are now more widely articulated as an explicit subject for public debate through the notion of a ‘health society’, it might be argued that the critical function initially offered through the notion of governmentality has become somewhat redundant. Against this background, the paper concludes by discussing, through examples relating to new biotechnologies and to drug policy, how a Foucauldian approach continues to be relevant in the contemporary context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greco, Monica"],"dc:date":"2009-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":135202,"sim:weight":0.277945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69398,"sim:weight":0.209524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85248,"sim:weight":0.207083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In keeping with neoliberal models of economic knowledge and practice, renewable energy instruments target the motivations of individuals by using incentive programs to reach environmental policy goals. The argument focuses especially on the way newly implemented market devices shape and represent the motivations of energy producers, suppliers, and traders. The centerpiece of the U.K. government\u0027s initiative is the creation of an artificial market in renewability, bought and sold as a virtual commodity. Although the realities of economic motivation complicate the practical implementation of the renewable market, these are represented as isolated and self-interested “exchanges” by market devices, providing policymakers and their critics with partial yet authoritative accounts of renewable policy, premised on narrow and contested assumptions about economic motivation and action.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reno, Joshua"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.47194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.423878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.364447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.364447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86074,"sim:weight":0.305024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Located Lexicon project develops understanding about if, how and why geo-location is used to generate crowd-sourced descriptions of the places we inhabit.  Since the mass take up of smart geo-locative devices we see a new geo-presence of community emerging and we want to devise tools that enable learners to both produce and analyse this user derived data.  The idea for this project grew from envisioning an augmented view, like that from the top of a tall building, in which the describing words found in tags and tweets posted in that location could be plotted onto a visual map of that area.  This would enable large scale overviews of an urban environment to be annotated with personal, everyday, ‘off the cuff’ data.\r\n\r\nTo this end, our project involves making two applications that enables the urban environment to be described vividly and personally by its inhabitants at a more granular, local level.  The first uses infrastructural terms from the built environment to search-and-visualise large scale user generated content (UGC) and the second asks individual users to place a value on, and describe their location in response to a broadcasted query.  We wanted to find out what words emerged as being common or shared in describing place from UGC and how a lexicon of terms could enable the formation of Twitter-like groups that allow users to engage in finding out more about their location, especially by spotting what is not there in the datasphere.  Our focus is on building and using applications that ‘update and respond in real-time’ to UGC to learn more about the spatial, temporal and subjective nature of place.  For this project, we understand ‘place’ as a ‘constellation of processes rather than a thing’ and so our focus is on the objects, qualities and activities that continually mix and carry on in a geographically defined location that contribute to user-generated descriptions of place.  \r\n\r\nThis paper presents the details of our experiments conducted so far and the outcomes produced.  We start by describing the context to outline our thinking behind, and motivation for, the project.  This is followed by a series of initial experiments we have undertaken that have informed a working concept for the Located Lexicon application.  We conclude the paper by drawing together the main findings and reflections from the project.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sprake, Juliet","Rogers , Pete"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.329293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.318615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.294705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11127,"sim:weight":0.294444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512108,"sim:weight":0.278722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To what extent do journalists live up to these ideals? Can we make any claims as to the social conditions that this performance depends on? Using Bourdieu’s theory of fields of cultural production, this article addresses these questions with evidence from the history of journalism in the United States. What is most distinctive about modern journalism is a specific practice: active news-gathering or reporting. This practice became common in the 1860s and 1870s with the emergence of journalism as a field with its own stakes, relatively independent from political advantage or literary merit. The power of field-specific capital to organize practices in the media has varied since then. The field consolidated in the era from 1890 to 1914, with the newspaper industry expanding. In the interwar years, the boundary between PR and journalism became blurry and the institutional basis for active news-gathering declined. Under favorable economic and political conditions reporting practices, including local and investigative reporting, flourished between 1945 and1970 across media forms. In the past 40 years the importance of active news-gathering has declined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Krause, Monika"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1444889,"sim:weight":0.476047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.350257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929894,"sim:weight":0.304302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929828,"sim:weight":0.289893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930362,"sim:weight":0.271337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929897,"sim:weight":0.270403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929841,"sim:weight":0.265194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.261383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44158,"sim:weight":0.201906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.196051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780590,"sim:weight":0.190689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Based on a cultural analysis of the brand as capitalist institution, it develops an understanding of the rationale behind the construction of large-scale architectural complexes that relate to corporate brands. The consequences of this process will be discussed regarding two examples of corporate brand-building (“Autostadt Wolfsburg”, “BMW Welt Munich”) and one case of indirectly brand-inspired city development (“Anting New Town”). \r\n\r\nTheoretically, the work relies on a poststructuralist framework, employing ideas from Deleuze and Sloterdijk. It argues that the brand can be interpreted as a “virtual” in the Deleuzian sense, and that its going-spatial can be read as a way to create new levels of virtual-actual interaction. These interactions will be interpreted as necessary for a brand to survive, but also to generate new levels of risk. \r\n\r\nThis work will analyse how the effects on the urban sphere that are the outcome of corporate spatialisation effectively mean that the city enters into a mode of virtual urbanity. In this process, urban structure will be shown to force the historical into space. A notion of a hybrid history will be developed. It will be shown that brand space consists of different modes of temporality which create different colliding “strands” of history. \r\n\r\nThese colliding histories are arguably part of what will be called “viral urbanism”. This viral mediatisation of space will be shown to result in a regime of “global urbanity”. This regime will be approached by integrating the arguments around virtual and actual into Sloterdijk’s concept of a world of “spheres”. The latter will be used to understand the spatiality of mediatised spaces. It will be argued that brand space can be seen as an instance of new media urbanism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gutzmer, Alexander"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.673393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.602269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929837,"sim:weight":0.591514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.584016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.57159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631815,"sim:weight":0.558762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447920,"sim:weight":0.546682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.543034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.52394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.502317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.502317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108497,"sim:weight":0.493383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108957,"sim:weight":0.491434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447847,"sim:weight":0.469966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.461394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":301,"sim:weight":0.456155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109077,"sim:weight":0.446501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85563,"sim:weight":0.436756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":668726,"sim:weight":0.419969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445509,"sim:weight":0.41445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As the range of information, context and users of Internet searches has grown, the relationship between the search query, search interest and user has become more tenuous. Not all users are seeking the same information, even if they use the same query term. Thus, the quality of search results has, at least potentially, been decreasing. Search engines have begun to respond to this problem by trying to personalise search in order to deliver more relevant results to the users. A query is now evaluated in the context of a user’s search history and other data compiled into a personal profile and associated with statistical groups. This, at least, is the promise stated by the search engines themselves. This paper tries to assess the current reality of the personalisation of search results. We analyse the mechanisms of personalisation in the case of Google web search by empirically testing three commonly held assumptions about what personalisation does. To do this, we developed new digital methods which are explained here. The findings suggest that Google personal search does not fully provide the much-touted benefits for its search users. More likely, it seems to serve the interest of advertisers in providing more relevant audiences to them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Feuz, Martin","Fuller, Matthew","Stalder, Felix"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84877,"sim:weight":0.477068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26271,"sim:weight":0.38839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.24664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929814,"sim:weight":0.226227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.21532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.183484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70175,"sim:weight":0.1655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.154629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

When scholars have discussed the state’s vision or imagination they have often critically examined how the state constructs aggregates of the population as a whole. But an emphasis on or critique of aggregation can only be the beginning of understanding the multiple and sometimes contradictory ways in which people are imagined in governance today. Results-based management has created a new way in which the state imagines people. In some policy arenas citizens have been turned into “beneficiaries” through the practices of state managers. Beneficiaries differ from citizen in a number of ways: Citizens are thought to benefit from policies with broad goals; beneficiaries are shown to benefit from specific interventions. Citizens are owed service; beneficiaries are selected for intervention if it suits specific funding priorities. Citizens are the origins of politics and the end of policies; beneficiaries are a means to an organization’s success.","bibo:AuthorList":["Krause, Monika"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.219028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109026,"sim:weight":0.200797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.156074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It argues that, in many ways, Greek and Bulgarian minority laws are in line with certain provisions of international treaties concluded by both states, which in turn were inspired by the way that non-Muslim millets were organized in the Ottoman Empire during the second half of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century. The state laws and international treaties aspired to secure a millet status for Greek and Bulgarian Muslims: i.e. the chief muftis became the religious and political leaders of these communities and assumed a role similar to that which non-Muslim religious leaders (milletbashis) had in the Ottoman Empire; muftis, like non-Muslim local religious leaders in the Ottoman state did, ruled the affairs of the Muslim communities with the assistance of elected local community councils. However, the legal framework by itself  could not secure a ‘millet life’ to Greek and Bulgarian Muslims for reasons related to weaknesses of the very same millet system and the nationalist environment of both states in which that system was to be applied.","bibo:AuthorList":["Katsikas, Stefanos"],"dc:date":"2009-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.311329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930823,"sim:weight":0.308781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85220,"sim:weight":0.28761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108348,"sim:weight":0.27276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.240925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108067,"sim:weight":0.206815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108545,"sim:weight":0.202831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108611,"sim:weight":0.20075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.164656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108699,"sim:weight":0.160461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Focusing on three of Agamben’s recent publications, Signatura Rerum: Sul Metodo, Il regno e la gloria. Per una genealogia teologica dell\u0027economia e del governo and What is an Apparatus?, the article looks first at Agamben’s development of Foucault’s archaeological method within his own concept of the signature. It then goes on to consider Agamben’s identification of an economic theology in contradistinction to Schmitt’s political theology and how Agamben’s discussion of collateral damage might be related to Foucault’s notion of security as developed in Security, Territory, Population. Finally, the article considers how Agamben links Foucault’s notion of ‘dispositif’ [apparatus] to an economic theology of government, calling for the development of counter-apparatuses in a similar way to Foucault’s call for ‘resistances.’ The article concludes by considering both the benefits and the limitations of Agamben’s engagement with Foucault.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fuggle, Sophie"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":41107,"sim:weight":0.198124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Covering a broad range of topics including the role of the street in literature, photography and journalism, practices which take place upon the street such as skateboarding, graffiti and flânerie and the politics and philosophy involved in negotiating the street, Word on the Street affirms the continued and renewed importance of the pedestrian street in the social consciousness of the 21st century.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fuggle, Sophie","Foust, Elisha"],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.720496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929837,"sim:weight":0.647601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9036006,"sim:weight":0.630639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.62874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187631,"sim:weight":0.622047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.62127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":328800,"sim:weight":0.605914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.605209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790077,"sim:weight":0.602167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71291,"sim:weight":0.592942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.587852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447568,"sim:weight":0.584016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43037,"sim:weight":0.582157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447920,"sim:weight":0.578479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709946,"sim:weight":0.567438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.566084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":433,"sim:weight":0.565499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.557567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1125027,"sim:weight":0.555431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225608,"sim:weight":0.546521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Focusing on the elite political discourse and the relationship between reconciliation and democratization, its chief argument is that in Greece continuing disagreement about the civil war did not inhibit a process of reconciliation because it was voiced within a normative framework in which violence had been repudiated as a political tool. \r\n\r\nParticularly since the fall of the Colonels’ dictatorship in 1974, reconciliation has been linked to a number of distinct political projects, some of which were as divisive as conciliatory in their effect. In each case, reconciliation meant different things to differing shades of political opinion, but the widespread adoption of the term by both the governing and opposition elites, as well as society as a whole, gradually entrapped politicians of all persuasions into accepting that a process of reconciliation had occurred. Reconciliation in Greece has therefore rested not on the establishment of a single agreed narrative representing the truth about the past, but rather on the righting of perceived injustices and the free articulation of differing interpretations of that past by both left and right within a democratic environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Siani-Davies, Peter","Katsikas, Stefanos"],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108447,"sim:weight":0.251498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.21155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6033,"sim:weight":0.201996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85055,"sim:weight":0.19529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.193517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.163019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108419,"sim:weight":0.144284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44363,"sim:weight":0.142672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.142498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108703,"sim:weight":0.109544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We decided to use art-making, and tapes of our focussed discussions in response to the art made, as the data for our exploration. The Group Analytic Symposium has given us the opportunity to share the art of the early stages of this research with an audience sympathetic to our experiential method of teaching, that is, in psychodynamic, interlocking groups held together by a large art therapy group. Paralleling our students’ end of year exhibition, this exhibition, ‘a group unconscious’, has raised issues about the potential of, and limitations to, art therapists’ personal and social art practice and the role of art in art therapy. Trusting ‘the unconscious’, art-making and the group process in creating the exhibition, has been a form of staff team development that feeds reflexively into the students’ learning in their progress towards becoming art therapists. \r\n\r\nChris Brown, Jane Dudley, Kevin Jones, Lesley Morris, Dean Reddick, Sally Skaife, Robin Tipple, Diana Velada and Jill Westwood","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Christopher","Dudley, Jane","Jones, Kevin","Morris, Lesley","Reddick, Dean","Skaife, Sally","Tipple, Robin A.","Velada, Diana","Westwood, Jill"],"dc:date":"2011-08-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930871,"sim:weight":0.498272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447062,"sim:weight":0.44209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999545,"sim:weight":0.429294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.248968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.197544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108240,"sim:weight":0.184792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108284,"sim:weight":0.181793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108524,"sim:weight":0.156803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.138609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Inspired by the spirit of art therapy and the conference theme the presentation will be in the form of an ‘arts based dreaming’. It focuses on the theories that are used in this specialized teaching and learning process.  It evolved from the authors’ immersion in the field as a migrant art therapy educator to Australia from the UK. As a piece of qualitative research a bricolage of methods were used including visual approaches to gather and analyse information from: literature; institutional sources; and key participants, including the author on the theories and practices of art therapy training programs in Australia. This also included investigating other places in the world shown to be influential (USA and UK). A body of knowledge has been created in the form of a ‘Cosmology and Genealogy of art therapy education in Australia’. The presentation will reflect the artistic aspects of the inquiry and embody the findings that show a diverse and multi-layered field of hybrid views and innovative approaches. Important issues for art therapy education were identified as: the position and emphasis on art; working with the therapy/education tension; the gender imbalance in the profession; Indigenous perspectives; intercultural issues; and difference. The horizons of the field revealed the importance of: developing the profile of the profession; the growth of research; and a trend towards discourses on arts and wellness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Westwood, Jill"],"dc:date":"2011-08-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.272834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.244121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.215807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I am interested in how shifts in the practices and beliefs around death are mediated by individuals, households and businesses who have an historical affinity towards movement, particularly across what has been called the ‘rural–urban nexus’. In what ways has this more mobile orientation influenced the perception of rites and responsibilities surrounding death? And how have more mobile ‘ways of dying’ in turn created new subjectivities and new ways in which to imagine relations between the living and the dead? I argue that African funeral directors based in Cape Town and the rural areas of the Eastern Cape – a steadily more numerous and prominent group of entrepreneurs – are well-placed to shape these processes, through their role as cultural mediators and technological innovators, and their particular emphasis on maintaining a flow of bodies (both dead and alive) between rural and urban areas. I focus on two aspects of contemporary South African funerals – embalming and exhumations – that\tare\tsuggestive\tof\thow\tthe\tmigration\tdynamic,\tand\tthe continuing demands from mobile mourners for innovations via the funeral industry, have encouraged new perceptions of and relations to the dead body.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, Rebekah"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A comparative analysis reveals that party aggregation at the Indian sub-national (state) level does not respond uniformly to changes in the federal distribution of powers. While federal centralization has positive and significant effects on the number of parties in Indian states, the effects of federal decentralization are relatively less important. Furthermore, Indian states that are highly dependent on the national government have fewer parties and a higher degree of party aggregation.

Further, a larger electorate and higher proportion of urban population is associated with lower turnout in the Indian states.","bibo:AuthorList":["Diwakar, Rekha"],"dc:date":"2008-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4189609,"sim:weight":0.54079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929828,"sim:weight":0.266507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.257002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.230545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.230374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47461,"sim:weight":0.226388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.222925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108707,"sim:weight":0.218183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.217042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.214572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447316,"sim:weight":0.21162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145159,"sim:weight":0.211131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767488,"sim:weight":0.210978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.20756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.20756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.20756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.20756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.20756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.20756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.20756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Existing scholarship regards India as an exception to this law at national level, but not at district level. This study tests the latter hypothesis through analysis of a comprehensive dataset covering Indian parliamentary elections in the period 1952—2004. The results show that a large number of Indian districts do not conform to the Duvergerian norm of two-party competition, and that there is no consistent movement towards the Duvergerian equilibrium. Furthermore, inter-region and inter-state variations in the size of district-level party systems make it difficult to generalize about the application of Duverger\u0027s law to the Indian case. The study concludes that a narrow focus on electoral rules is inadequate, and that a more comprehensive set of explanatory variables is needed to explain the size of the Indian party system even at the district level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Diwakar, Rekha"],"dc:date":"2007-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47461,"sim:weight":0.580855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710638,"sim:weight":0.508895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75377,"sim:weight":0.439791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929828,"sim:weight":0.350865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.31545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.311166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76252,"sim:weight":0.300985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.299801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145159,"sim:weight":0.295599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.293195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.292873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.290299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.283195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.281742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767710,"sim:weight":0.276692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77832,"sim:weight":0.275966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.269343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43702,"sim:weight":0.267343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.262691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.260942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We review the Nagayama or ‘all possibilities\u0027 triangle display, and show that it can only legitimately be used to show an overall ‘field’ of results that is logically feasible, called the effective space of competition, which varies with the number of observable parties. We apply this reductionist view to analysing outcomes in three leading plurality rule systems (the USA, India and Great Britain), focusing on evidence of the Duvergerian psychological effect acting on voters during campaign periods. The Effective Competition Space view illuminates some key differences across countries, and variations with rising numbers of parties competing. We next consider a more holistic approach, the ‘crown’ diagram, which links electoral district outcomes more closely to the most important politico-ideological dimension in each country. Both views suggest some tentative evolutionary hypotheses for the variegated development of plurality rule systems over time. Britain is a highly nationalized party system, but one that has moved substantially away from Duvergerian predictions of two-party focusing, and towards multiparty politics. The USA seems to be a case of ‘stunted development’. India shows a partial Duvergerian conformity, yet combined with a substantial vertical scatter of non-Duvergerian results. Applications to over-time and regional analysis within countries are also sketched.","bibo:AuthorList":["Diwakar, Rekha","Dunleavy, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2011-09-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86214,"sim:weight":0.218803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.187761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.180777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930362,"sim:weight":0.169401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The article strongly suggests that the Roma ‘space problem’ cannot be solved by attempts to either construct (settlement) or constrict (expulsion) Roma spaces by an outside authority, but rather through an acceptance of Roma’s temporary presence—even if it involves a long-term temporality—in camps ‘abroad’ and continued support for Roma communities ‘at home’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pusca, Anca M"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108067,"sim:weight":0.645558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48311,"sim:weight":0.439039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.318853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108033,"sim:weight":0.316305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.31557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.308049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.307394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.306318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.306318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.30162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.300176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108656,"sim:weight":0.299928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.294898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.294738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.293616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447316,"sim:weight":0.289576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.288121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.287814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.277089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.275676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this thesis is to explore factors accounting for these observed differences in sleep quality between individuals. Using data from a large-scale twin study this thesis uses behavioural genetic techniques to investigate genetic and environmental influences on sleep quality in a sample of 1,556 twins and siblings aged 18-27 years. The first four studies use quantitative genetic techniques to investigate 1) associations between components of sleep quality and the overlap in the genetic and environmental influences accounting for them; 2) specific non-shared environmental influences on global sleep quality; 3) the presence of gene-environment interplay between sleep quality and dependent negative life events; and 4) the association between sleep quality and diurnal preference, and the overlap in their aetiological influences. Most importantly, there was substantial genetic overlap between individual components of sleep quality (rA mostly ≥.50); sleep quality and diurnal preference (rD \u003d .52[95% CI\u003d.37-.70]); and sleep quality and dependent negative life events (rD \u003d .63[.45-.83]) – the latter finding providing evidence of gene-environment correlation. In general, non-shared environmental overlap was small (rE mostly ≤.40). The final study used a candidate gene approach to investigate associations between sleep quality and diurnal preference with 5HTTLPR, PER3, and CLOCK 3111 – polymorphisms hypothesized to be implicated in sleep and/or the circadian system. An association was found between the ‘long’ allele of 5HTTLPR and poor sleep quality (β \u003d -.34, p\u003c.01). This thesis utilises the twin method in novel ways in the context of sleep research and advances knowledge of the genetic and environmental underpinnings of the variation in sleep quality in healthy young adults.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barclay, Nicola L."],"dc:date":"2011-05-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5222882,"sim:weight":0.809937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5851630,"sim:weight":0.790023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.763716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183841,"sim:weight":0.759461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443263,"sim:weight":0.680251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":778226,"sim:weight":0.678299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145298,"sim:weight":0.670083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108088,"sim:weight":0.669113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81228,"sim:weight":0.658059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88405,"sim:weight":0.652242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443249,"sim:weight":0.652149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88399,"sim:weight":0.62761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443245,"sim:weight":0.616155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999296,"sim:weight":0.588343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767272,"sim:weight":0.586214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":850415,"sim:weight":0.563419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5848563,"sim:weight":0.546955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.517355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":845171,"sim:weight":0.476314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102659,"sim:weight":0.463925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, as researchers have since focused on individuals at the extreme end of the spectrum, nonclinical psychopathy remains an under-researched topic. For example, a lack of empathy is considered a defining feature of psychopathy, yet little research has examined the relationship between nonclinical psychopathy and empathy. Although Machiavellianism most likely falls on the psychopathy continuum, research has barely investigated whether similar emotional deficits exist in Machiavellianism. In addition, studies investigating emotional deficits/dysfunction in psychopathy have often not differentiated between the primary and secondary subtypes. This dissertation aims to examine whether emotional deficits potentially associated with psychopathy in clinical samples are also associated with psychopathy (primary and secondary) and Machiavellianism in nonclinical samples. In addition, this dissertation identifies variations and similarities in emotional deficits among primary psychopathy, secondary psychopathy and Machiavellianism in nonclinical samples. Study 1 examines the psychopathy subtypes and Machiavellianism in relation to trait anxiety. Study 2 investigates the psychopathy subtypes and Machiavellianism in relation to the emotional Stroop paradigm. Study 3 examines the psychopathy subtypes and Machiavellianism in relation to alexithymia. Study 4 explores aggression, aggressive thoughts and intergroup hostility in relation to the psychopathy subtypes and Machiavellianism. Emotional empathy is investigated in study 5, and study 6 investigates whether Theory of Mind (ToM) deficits exist in these traits. The 7th and final study investigates the traits in relation to life satisfaction and intimate relationships. The results indicate that nonclinical psychopathy and Machiavellianism are associated with trait anxiety, alexithymia, aggression, emotional empathy errors, ToM errors, lesser life satisfaction and relationship quality, but not with interference on the emotional Stroop paradigm. The implications of the empirical results for our understanding of emotional dysfunction in psychopathic and Machiavellian traits are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ali, Farah"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":266928,"sim:weight":0.332918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631576,"sim:weight":0.167929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10862,"sim:weight":0.153865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631699,"sim:weight":0.126643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22778,"sim:weight":0.114894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631818,"sim:weight":0.10624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77481,"sim:weight":0.102114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780053,"sim:weight":0.101034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.0932569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75642,"sim:weight":0.0908312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.0883375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76336,"sim:weight":0.0870282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76340,"sim:weight":0.0826425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.0823835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631742,"sim:weight":0.0752646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795345,"sim:weight":0.0743051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76070,"sim:weight":0.0724853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.0719826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.0698868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631464,"sim:weight":0.0606683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It argues that there were two main acting schools – ‘school’ here meaning an established unified style of acting shared by a group of actors and directors. The first, starting with the 1936 production of Electra by Sophocles directed by Dimitris Rontiris’s at the National Theatre of Greece and running through roughly to the late 1970s, developed from a vocal/rhetorical/text-based approach. The second, established by Karolos Koun’s Art Theatre in 1942 and which can be said to have ended with his death in 1987, was based on a bodily/physical one. The thesis examines the ways in which these two schools combined and influenced acting, creating new tendencies in the last three decades of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe focus here is on tragedy because this genre is presented on the Greek stage regularly, and, therefore, it is an eloquent example of the evolution of acting in Greece. Sophocles’s Electra has been chosen as a case study not only because the play was frequently staged throughout the twentieth century, but primarily because it was acted and directed by important actors and directors who occupied quite different positions within the Greek theatre field. Thus it is a play that provides the most potent example of the development of the acting schools in question.\r\n\r\nThis thesis is an empirical study using Greek actors and directors as its primary source. In giving them a strong voice, it follows their creative process and their perception of their roles and productions. At the same time, it provides a historical context for understanding the conditions of Greek theatre life and their impact on Greek actors and their work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Antoniou, Michaela"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This research project moves through a series of Digital Sociology case studies that mimic the changes in paradigms of the WWW from 2005-2010 in the forms of Web 1.0 to 2.0 and beyond to augmented reality and the cloud.  Netmodern social theory is an emergent and speculative product of the research findings of this thesis and the subjective experiences of the researcher in experiencing and explaining digital realities in the research. All of the case studies employ practice-based approaches of original investigation through digital interventions completely immersed in particular waves of innovation and change. The role of the researcher shifts from administrator to mediator and observer as the very fabric of the social web transforms and evolves. The suggestion of the research findings is that you need to actually look at everything differently in order to study the research objects of emergent social agency and forms in digital media. Existing forms of critical analysis and methodological frameworks, particularly those concerned with conceptual models of media literacy or collective intelligence are insufficient as explanatory methods.  Studying media literacy is most concerned with ‘how’ we create and interact in online social life beyond issues of simple accessibility. The focus of collective intelligence research is ‘what’ knowledge is available for interaction and a canvas for relationships between agency and knowledge forms. All of the case studies in this research project speak to and critique the intersections and relationships of emergent social agency and forms prevalent in Digital Sociology. The collective case studies explore online academic communities (BlogScholar), agency and popularity in the Twitter social network (Twae) and a variety of representations of collective intelligence in action (Web 2.0 cases studies).  The research results suggest that the Internet is not so much intersecting with as it is being culture, economy, and technology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brauer, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2011-03-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.692452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.664012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.646768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156924,"sim:weight":0.637174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17180,"sim:weight":0.634225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187740,"sim:weight":0.632671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.625721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187621,"sim:weight":0.625288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151793,"sim:weight":0.625281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.62224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.616363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193234,"sim:weight":0.61292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":79172,"sim:weight":0.605429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151791,"sim:weight":0.60459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794969,"sim:weight":0.604067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.603638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":92950,"sim:weight":0.603124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187474,"sim:weight":0.603087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447791,"sim:weight":0.597984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2750488,"sim:weight":0.596852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":1447667,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"A Genealogy and Critique of Guy Debord\u0027s Theory of Spectacle","bibo:abstract":"This thesis addresses Guy Debord\u0027s theory of spectacle through its primary philosophical and theoretical influences. Through doing so it highlights the importance of his largely overlooked concerns with time and history, and interprets the theory on that basis. The theory of spectacle is shown to be not simply a critique of the mass media, as is often assumed, but rather an account of a relationship with history; or more specifically, an alienated relation to the construction of history. This approach thus offers a means of addressing Debord’s Hegelian Marxism. The thesis connects the latter to Debord’s interests in strategy, chance and play by way of its existential elements, and uses these themes to investigate his own and the Situationist International’s (S.I.) concerns with praxis, political action and organisation.\r\n\r\nAddressing Debord and the S.I.’s work in this way also highlights the shortcomings of the theory of spectacle. The theory is based upon the separation of an acting subject from his or her own actions, and in viewing capitalist society under this rubric it tends towards replacing Marx\u0027s presentation of capital as an antagonistic social relation with an abstract opposition between an alienated consciousness and a homogenised world. Yet whilst the theory itself may be problematic, the conceptions of time, history and subjectivity that inform it may be of greater interest. Drawing attention to Debord\u0027s claims that theories should be understood as strategic interventions, and also to the S.I.\u0027s calls for their own supersession, the thesis uses its observations on the nature of Debord\u0027s Hegelian Marxism to cast the theory of spectacle as a particular moment within a broader notion of historical agency. It thus contends that Debord\u0027s work can be seen to imply a model of collective political will, and offers initial suggestions as to how that interpretation might be developed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bunyard, Tom"],"dc:date":"2011-02-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1445509,"sim:weight":0.765588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769056,"sim:weight":0.555815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46201,"sim:weight":0.553149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381952,"sim:weight":0.551675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44865,"sim:weight":0.547424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47164,"sim:weight":0.541013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383927,"sim:weight":0.534264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386225,"sim:weight":0.523724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43493,"sim:weight":0.506208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383315,"sim:weight":0.502767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710675,"sim:weight":0.50025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73269,"sim:weight":0.494274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102638,"sim:weight":0.493857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710213,"sim:weight":0.491974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7252,"sim:weight":0.491161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383344,"sim:weight":0.488905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710491,"sim:weight":0.48339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1126336,"sim:weight":0.478794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99153,"sim:weight":0.478774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383931,"sim:weight":0.468118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A review of the arguments of Gentile, Griffin, Morgan, Kershaw, Eatwell, Payne, Burrin and Voegelin is helpful to the reader who is unfamiliar with a series of complex arguments, which straddle decades.","bibo:AuthorList":["Levy, Carl"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":57738,"sim:weight":0.236468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66602,"sim:weight":0.186603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57725,"sim:weight":0.169741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.16577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.152988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.151678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.143481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58478,"sim:weight":0.139452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.1391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.136782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445509,"sim:weight":0.121652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1444841,"sim:weight":0.117068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study positions the NCC as the key transformation of media reform during the political transition to democracy. On the one hand, it addresses the role of media in transitional societies and how political and industry power elites try to maintain control. On the other hand, it traces the rise of the ‘regulatory state’, a global trend towards regulatory reform, and investigates how the political environment in transitional countries may influence its development. This research is based on the analysis of case studies spanning issues of institutional legitimacy, media ownership, and convergence legislation, with the support of data collected by document analysis and interviews with actors in the policymaking process.\r\n\r\nThe findings point to how Taiwan’s post-authoritarian political background has outweighed economic and technological factors as described in mainstream literature in giving rise to the creation of the agency. The analysis demonstrates that state intervention and politicised concepts of democratisation and independence of the agency both impair media regulatory capacities in transitional societies. More importantly, it is indicated that the threat to democracy has been shifting from authoritarian states to unfettered markets where concentration of media ownership and impediments to media reform through entrenched politico-economic networks have taken place. I question the popular discourse that democratisation is equal to the withdrawal of the state in media regulation, calling instead for active civic engagement to hold the agency accountable, scrutinise its performance, and make the media better serve the public.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen, Ya-Chi"],"dc:date":"2011-08-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":112427,"sim:weight":0.560449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":535425,"sim:weight":0.552967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794547,"sim:weight":0.5316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":219187,"sim:weight":0.527217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5080608,"sim:weight":0.526961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":219189,"sim:weight":0.525206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8791781,"sim:weight":0.525006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95614,"sim:weight":0.520416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":210162,"sim:weight":0.513776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4882,"sim:weight":0.509346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":92939,"sim:weight":0.47957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17114,"sim:weight":0.479025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1072021,"sim:weight":0.477531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75221,"sim:weight":0.475584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93207,"sim:weight":0.473268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99191,"sim:weight":0.469997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1072019,"sim:weight":0.441587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14994,"sim:weight":0.434844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":223756,"sim:weight":0.414123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":617659,"sim:weight":0.390733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These were examined by three main studies across various age-ranges.\r\n\r\nStudy 1 examined terms for and perceptions of bullying-like behaviours in South Korea using a qualitative approach, from young children to adults. Results showed that wang-ta was the term predominantly used to describe bullying-like behaviour in South Korea. Depending on types of aggression and participants’ ages, different terms emerged showing historical changes within a culture. 10-15 years old pupils used their own terms, different from wang-ta; and workplace personnel and 10-15 year old pupils showed negative attitudes towards victims.\r\n\r\nPrevious studies showed that bullying–like behaviours among young children differ in some ways from those of older children. Study 2 investigated bullying-like behaviours among 6 year olds in South Korea using peer, self, and teacher reports; and examined bullying roles in relation to various types of aggression and peer status. Results showed that depending on informants, bullying roles were nominated\r\ndifferently; the role of aggressors showed higher consistency across informants than other roles. Relational victimisation was seen differently depending on informants.\r\n\r\nOne of the theories for why some people engage in bullying-like behaviours has focused on their moral understanding about aggressive behaviours. Study 3 investigated moral reasoning about aggressive behaviours in terms of types of aggression, age, gender, and experience of aggression. Sixty 7 year olds and ninety 11 year olds from South Korea participated. Results indicated that moral reasoning about aggressive behaviours differed by type of aggression and children’s age. Social exclusion was regarded as less wrong and less harmful than other types of aggressive behaviours. Gender differences were rarely found. The results are discussed in terms of pupils’ attitudes toward wang-ta in South Korea.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, Seung-ha"],"dc:date":"2011-02-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45450,"sim:weight":0.605906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99276,"sim:weight":0.571347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710167,"sim:weight":0.563247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4153043,"sim:weight":0.560804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":741557,"sim:weight":0.55895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":888531,"sim:weight":0.550763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101238,"sim:weight":0.549643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47290,"sim:weight":0.543152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393398,"sim:weight":0.532841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5067009,"sim:weight":0.526072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9028441,"sim:weight":0.520415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":821792,"sim:weight":0.511345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46478,"sim:weight":0.508867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82393,"sim:weight":0.508036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48776,"sim:weight":0.500243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586652,"sim:weight":0.495326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795072,"sim:weight":0.47909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23220,"sim:weight":0.457526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":677153,"sim:weight":0.456376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1039792,"sim:weight":0.424634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The research applies a governmentality perspective to consider how people working within government (using techniques of governmentality to govern populations) are subject to regimes of governmentality themselves. A substantial body of the research is based on detailed ethnographic work (both participant observation and extensive semi-structured, reflexive qualitative interviews with policy practitioners) in Hackney, an inner London borough with a very diverse population (in terms of ethnicity, economic status, migration histories, beliefs and experiences). Hackney rarely appears in narratives of community cohesion policy, and local practitioners have framed it as a place that is comfortable with diversity – a success story of twenty-first century multiculturalism. Often this story is told (in everyday talk and in official documents) by reference to places which have come to epitomise \u0027community cohesion problems\u0027, specifically Oldham (representing segregation between white and Asian communities, the potential for explosive violence), Barking and Dagenham (standing for problems with a disenfranchised \u0027white working class\u0027 turning to racist extremism) and Peterborough (as a place coping with sudden large-scale new immigration). The thesis follows these narratives, interviewing policy practitioners in each of these places to understand how they negotiate community cohesion policy from within the narrative, as well as policy practitioners working with local government at the national level who shed light on how places, communities and the practice of policy are understood from this location. The thesis raises questions of how to understand practices of government, and the uncomfortable and ambiguous ethical negotiations such practices sometimes entail; the importance of place and place-branding in governing; the relationship of narrative, place and governing to questions of material power inequalities; and the potential for understanding government through a \u0027sociological imagination\u0027.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Hannah"],"dc:date":"2011-04-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.750995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156168,"sim:weight":0.688762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162978,"sim:weight":0.676427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2884,"sim:weight":0.66565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.659637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109003,"sim:weight":0.656732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109078,"sim:weight":0.653455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44868,"sim:weight":0.640122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107298,"sim:weight":0.63671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43649,"sim:weight":0.635903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145949,"sim:weight":0.621596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106470,"sim:weight":0.618507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999527,"sim:weight":0.617821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46521,"sim:weight":0.617061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":425,"sim:weight":0.615531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104084,"sim:weight":0.615076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181445,"sim:weight":0.609504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1347928,"sim:weight":0.605254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43845,"sim:weight":0.604478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154814,"sim:weight":0.603209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The South project re-conceptualises the artist’s book and wider bookforms, encouraging models of interaction that are aware of specific locations and individual subjects. These alternatives are a response to what this thesis frames as two rapidly stagnating forms. The thesis argues that both the artist’s book and electronic literature (see the glossary on page 343 for definitions of the key terms used throughout this thesis) have not made a significant impact on the cultural landscape of the early 21st century. Nor have they made a significant use of the key technological changes that have occurred since the first electronic literature emerged in the late 1970s (in the form of interactive fictions, sometimes called ‘Text Adventures’, such as Colossal Cave Adventure (Crowther, 1976)). \r\n\r\nIn order to move forward from the increasingly problematic, disembodied, computational models used in these early digital works (discussed in chapters two, five and six) this thesis specifically recommends the formation of temporally specific, contextualised, relationships between readers and digital texts. The South project presents a multi-linear, situated and embodied form of intra-activity (see glossary) as an alternative to more linear forms of interaction. These ideas and their implications for electronic literature and artist’s books will be clarified and outlined throughout this thesis, as will the rationale for framing them as valid models for moving electronic literature and artist’s books into a position of cultural and technological relevance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dare, Eleanor"],"dc:date":"2010-10-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.6241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.607868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352215,"sim:weight":0.603674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.578223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43024,"sim:weight":0.577079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.571326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46636,"sim:weight":0.563833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.563064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.555283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.554883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929837,"sim:weight":0.554718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.552314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.546031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.54548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.544068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352169,"sim:weight":0.540738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.532458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.528795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.524875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11127,"sim:weight":0.516563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This concern, founded in the theory of the double significance of language advanced by Émile Benveniste, extends in Agamben’s thought from the linguistic to the political, in which it is articulated in terms of the exception, the subject of that illicit intellectual exchange between Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Alternatively, Agamben also speaks of the taking place of language in terms of intentionality, a concept revived from Scholastic philosophy by Franz Brentano, a principal influence upon Agamben’s own principal influence Martin Heidegger. Brentano’s regeneration of intentionality directly paved the way for twentieth-century phenomenology, but his insistence on the likeness of philosophy and science, the organization of concepts into a classificatory system, and his animosity towards the linguistic have all arguably contributed to the restriction of his work to the margins of contemporary thought. How do these two notions, therefore, exception and intention, converge in Agamben’s thought, and what bearing does this confluence have upon Brentano’s largely forgotten original articulation of the concept? This thesis establishes an original reading of Agamben’s thought by tracing the evolution of the taking place of language in its multifarious appearances in his corpus, and locates an implicit correspondence between the thinker and his invisible predecessor.","bibo:AuthorList":["Doussan, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2011-06-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1144931,"sim:weight":0.613475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71510,"sim:weight":0.605004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6373,"sim:weight":0.537429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769056,"sim:weight":0.50377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.500187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795071,"sim:weight":0.4948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71621,"sim:weight":0.49169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447898,"sim:weight":0.475592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382758,"sim:weight":0.457561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154324,"sim:weight":0.457187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46635,"sim:weight":0.45646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684312,"sim:weight":0.455534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108705,"sim:weight":0.445898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445179,"sim:weight":0.445164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447791,"sim:weight":0.437992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47099,"sim:weight":0.433003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109076,"sim:weight":0.432887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5960,"sim:weight":0.432571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71509,"sim:weight":0.425865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44750,"sim:weight":0.424918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The directors provide a visual portrayal demonstrating that language and gesture, within time and space, are particularly important when raising issues and debates around the relationships between the private and the public. The perspective of the social and political structures lead to an exploration of the importance of the placement of the pre pubescent child within this environment.

I am exploring cultural production as an activity which does not fit conventional definitions of work, as it is self-directed, frequently unpaid and takes place outside of paid employment. It is precisely its irregular character which makes cultural production vulnerable to barriers to free time, such as the expensive rent and chronic overwork prevalent in London. \r\n\r\nI explore the social conditions of cultural production as an intersection of several factors: material conditions (particularly housing and the cost of living) which can shape the time and space artists have for their work, and their ability to survive on part-time and freelance employment; the politics of the cultural field, which shape the expectations artists have for their work and lives; cultural and social policies, which also impact on artists\u0027 ability to support themselves; and subjective issues such as artists\u0027 sense of themselves and their work, their sense of place and their relationship to other artists. This project explores how these factors intersect and inter-relate, in the way that social conditions can affect who can be an artist, who can sustain an artistic career, and the ways in which one can be an artist. In particular, I focus on the relationship between housing and professional identities, and how this functions differently in London and Berlin. \r\n\r\nIn order to explore these intersections, the project brings together policy analysis, interviews, biographical narrative descriptions, photographs and descriptions of my travels through neighbourhoods in both cities.

We investigated whether the temporal binding between perceptual estimates of operant actions and their effects depends on the occurrence of the effect (inferential processes) or on the prediction that the effect will occur (predictive processes). By varying the probability with which a simple manual action produced an auditory effect, we showed that both the actual and the predicted occurrence of the effect played a role. When predictability of the effect of action was low, temporal binding was found only on those trials where the auditory effect occurred. In contrast, when predictability of the effect of action was high, temporal binding occurred even on trials where the action produced no effect. Further analysis showed that the predictive process is modulated by recent experience of the action-effect relation. We conclude that the experience of action depends on a dynamic combination of predictive and inferential processes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, James W.","Haggard, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We studied the time at which people perceived a simple manual action to occur, when statistical contingency indicated a causal relation between action and effect, and when no such relation was indicated. Both predictive and inferential \"postdictive\" shifts in the time of action depended on strong contingency between action and effect.

Sense of agency may depend on internal motoric signals, and general inferences about external events. We used priming to modulate the sense of agency for voluntary and involuntary movements, by modifying the content of conscious thought prior to moving. Trials began with the presentation of one of two supraliminal primes, which corresponded to the effect of a voluntary action participants subsequently made. The perceived interval between movement and effect was used as an implicit measure of sense of agency. Primes modulated perceived intervals for both voluntary and involuntary movements, but the modulation was greatest for involuntary movements. A second experiment showed that this modulation depended on prime-movement (temporal) contiguity. We propose that sense of agency is based on a combination of internal motoric signals and external sensory evidence about the source of actions and effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, James W.","Wegner, Daniel M","Haggard, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447729,"sim:weight":0.535331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447737,"sim:weight":0.528567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.331837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.327317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.313472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.307473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.307473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.306883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.306883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.301746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.301746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.296699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.291559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.290796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.272205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222867,"sim:weight":0.267137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69860,"sim:weight":0.258828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.255177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.254789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.251858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Aberrant experience of agency is characteristic of schizophrenia. An understanding of the neurobiological basis of such experience is therefore of considerable importance for developing successful models of the disease. We aimed to characterise the effects of ketamine, a drug model for psychosis, on sense of agency (SoA). SoA is associated with a subjective compression of the temporal interval between an action and its effects: This is known as \"intentional binding\". This action-effect binding provides an indirect measure of SoA. Previous research has found that the magnitude of binding is exaggerated in patients with schizophrenia. We therefore investigated whether ketamine administration to otherwise healthy adults induced a similar pattern of binding. Methods. 14 right-handed healthy participants (8 female; mean age 22.4 years) were given low-dose ketamine (100 ng/mL plasma) and completed the binding task. They also underwent structured clinical interviews. Results. Ketamine mimicked the performance of schizophrenia patients on the intentional binding task, significantly increasing binding relative to placebo. The size of this effect also correlated with aberrant bodily experiences engendered by the drug. Conclusions. These data suggest that ketamine may be able to mimic certain aberrant agency experiences that characterise schizophrenia. The link to individual changes in bodily experience suggests that the fundamental change produced by the drug has wider consequences in terms of individuals\u0027 experiences of their bodies and movements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, James W.","Turner, Danielle C","Corlett, Philip R","Arana, Fernando S","Morgan, Hannah L","Absalom, Antony R","Adapa, Ram","de Wit, Sanne","Everitt, Jessica C","Gardner, Jenny M","Pigott, Jennifer S","Haggard, Patrick","Fletcher, Paul C"],"dc:date":"2011-02-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447729,"sim:weight":0.56521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447728,"sim:weight":0.520618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447733,"sim:weight":0.513554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447726,"sim:weight":0.482035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.287584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.272124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.25972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109165,"sim:weight":0.258458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.226678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.224841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.220015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.156455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, little is known about the experience of voluntary action in PD patients. A key component of action experience is the feeling of controlling one\u0027s own actions, and through them, external events. In healthy individuals this sense of agency (SoA) is associated with a subjective compression of time, such that actions and their effects are perceived as bound together across time. This action-effect binding provides an indirect measure of SoA. Nine PD patients and age-matched controls judged the time of voluntary actions and of an auditory effect (a tone) of the action. The pattern of results resembled previous studies, with the perceived time of actions showing a shift towards the subsequent tone, relative to a baseline condition involving actions without tones. Similarly, the perceived times of tones showed a shift towards the preceding action that caused the tone, relative to a baseline condition involving tones only. The patients were tested both on and off dopaminergic medication. PD patients off medication showed no significant change in action-effect binding relative to controls. Conversely, PD patients on medication showed a significant increase in action-effect binding relative to their own performance off medication. Increased availability of dopamine strengthened the experience of association between actions and external events, enhancing the sense of agency. These results shed light on the contribution of dopamine to the experience of instrumental action, and also on impulse control disorders and psychosis in medicated PD patients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, James W.","Schneider, Susanne A","Schwingenschuh, Petra","Moretto, Giovanna","Bhatia, Kailash P","Haggard, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447731,"sim:weight":0.513554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It examines in particular the local commodity network created by people who practised ethical consumption and who worked in fair-trade retail and organic farming. It is based upon fifteen months of fieldwork in the city of Palermo, Sicily’s capital, and its rural province, among predominantly lower-middle-class citizens.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to abstract views of the market logic as the dominant one in industrialised societies, the people of Palermo and western Sicily drew upon numerous values from outside a capitalist belief system to conceptualise the economy as a moral construct. However, the ways in which they did so were mobile, contested and ambiguous, and varied along the lines of production, exchange and consumption. The thesis explores how notions of value, normativity and motivations to behave ethically in economic processes all had to be negotiated through the demands of daily life. It therefore argues that the economic, political, and cultural constraints faced by people striving to build alternative economies cannot be overlooked, thus interrogating ethnographically the central anthropological issue of how and if economies are embedded in social relations.\r\n\r\nThe thesis begins with an outline of the three main groups of actors—consumers, fair-traders and farmers—and how they embody the recent historical transformations that have taken place in Sicily. It then looks in detail at each group, analysing how agency is played out both at the symbolic and practical level. The final chapter highlights the commonalities and contradictions shown by this local moral economy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Orlando, Giovanni"],"dc:date":"2010-07-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9321370,"sim:weight":0.627763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108033,"sim:weight":0.618882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826634,"sim:weight":0.606396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5091847,"sim:weight":0.581701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1295,"sim:weight":0.564782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3510,"sim:weight":0.564705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397518,"sim:weight":0.563148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65139,"sim:weight":0.559878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2785714,"sim:weight":0.556366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1024324,"sim:weight":0.555868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1369,"sim:weight":0.552954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95723,"sim:weight":0.54752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":981226,"sim:weight":0.546456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8766856,"sim:weight":0.544553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2711830,"sim:weight":0.535247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12885,"sim:weight":0.53175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.526667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.526667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":845,"sim:weight":0.523763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790133,"sim:weight":0.522684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Existing ecological future narratives such as sustainable futures and global warming have been effective at relaying the seriousness and scale of ecological problems but they can also be ambiguous, overwhelming and lead to stasis. In this research, I explore backcasting as a useful mechanism for creating detailed preferred futures and mapping out how those future states can be realised. During my exploration of backasting processes, I identify the possibility for backcasting to move beyond a simple outcome-driven process and instead become a process that creates a space for reflection, formulating and reformulating solutions.\r\n\r\nI examine four case studies: Cradle-to-Cradle, Transition Towns, Melbourne 2032 and case study 4 which involves 5 workshops in 3 secondary schools. These illustrations present how the creation of alternative futures can be used to address ecological problems. I developed, tested and participated in a variation of backcasting, called future reflective backcasting, in a workshop format. The workshop was enabled by my involvement in an activist group called Culture Jammers. My involvement with Culture Jammers not only reflected and encouraged my growing concern about environmental issues but it also motivated my interest in how small groups respond to such issues.\r\n\r\nIn the workshop, participants generated preferred future states that shaped conversational exchanges which helped them to critically reflect on existing circumstances and identify actions to take in the present. Based on the case studies and participant feedback, I produced a set of recommendations detailing how the future reflective backcasting workshop model should be conducted as well as how to set up and manage the future reflective conversational exchanges. This thesis contributes new knowledge to academic research by identifying a form of backcasting that has not been acknowledged in futures literature or design practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["George, Lisa"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.183992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.15917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.128529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This revolution has come about through the confluence of Web-related technologies and the approaching universal adoption of internet connectivity. Add to this mix the normalised use of lossy compression in digital music and the increase in digital music download and streaming services; the result is an environment where nearly anyone can listen to nearly any piece of music nearly anywhere. This is in many respects the pinnacle in music access and availability. Yet, a listener is now faced with a\r\ndilemma of choice. Without being familiar with the ever-expanding millions of songs available, how does a listener know what to listen to? If a near-complete collection of recorded music is available what does one listen to next? While the world of music distribution underwent a revolution, the ubiquitous access and availability it created brought new problems in recommendation and discovery.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, a solution to these problems of recommendation and discovery is presented. We begin with an introduction to the core concepts around the playlist (i.e. sequential ordering of musical works). Next, we examine the history of the playlist as a recommendation technique, starting from before the invention of audio recording and moving through to modern automatic methods. This leads to an awareness that the creation of suitable playlists requires a high degree of knowledge of the relation between songs in a collection (e.g. song similarity). To better inform our base of knowledge of the relationships between songs we explore the use of social network analysis in combination with content-based music information retrieval. In an effort to show the promise of this more complex relational space, a fully automatic interactive radio system is proposed, using audio-content and social network data as a backbone. The implementation of the system is detailed. The creation of this system presents another problem in the area of evaluation. To that end, a novel distance metric between playlists is specified and tested. We then conclude with a discussion of what has been shown and what future work remains.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fields, Benjamin"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.315378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.271359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26473,"sim:weight":0.241151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70175,"sim:weight":0.164958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.15613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The children learn French as a target language in the context of a regular second grade multilingual Luxembourgish classroom. With TEO these children produce stories in French while relying on the Luxembourgish language for negotiating the contents of the story as well as the language forms needed. Through storying the children assign significance to objects and events by integrating their personal histories. The target language, its vocabulary and its grammar emerge from the communicative language produced in the process of storying with the TEO tool.\r\n\r\nI study the impact of TEO as a nonhuman actor on the language learning process in the constantly changing collective or association of human and nonhuman actors constituting the TEO team. Concepts of Activity Theory and Actor-Network-Theory are used to explain and extend the tool metaphor underlying the use of electronic tools in language learning in a multilingual classroom.\r\n\r\nThe transcription and detailed analysis of about ten minutes of language production provides the main data of my thesis. The transcription follows the interplay of TEO as a nonhuman actor and of the bodies of the human actors instantiated in their particular utterances, gestures, gazes and voices. The collective language production process emerging from the transcription is described and interpreted by referring to the transcribed text which includes a substantial number of stills taken from the videotape, thus revealing the roles and functions of TEO in the collective oral French language learning process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gretsch, Gerard"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This article argues that research into family learning can usefully be linked to Bourdieu’s theory of ‘symbolic capitals’ to acknowledge the stores of wealth that refugee families may possess, which can be activated in the new environment to create ‘transcultural capital’ – a relatively new concept in the area of migration studies. Putnam’s notions of bonding and bridging capital are also helpful in the design of family learning programmes to consider how best to stimulate social cohesion at the present time. An ethnographic study of a family learning course for refugee parents in two South London schools highlights the need for an understanding of the specific strengths and needs of refugee parents. However, this can only be achieved by taking time to find out about their existing networks, the experience that they bring with them, involving them in course design and delivery, and engaging indiscussion about their plans for the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hope, Julia"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52031,"sim:weight":0.331072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316083,"sim:weight":0.309637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.257488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.238117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.235759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108065,"sim:weight":0.230556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":261048,"sim:weight":0.229207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

My original contribution is an improved and\r\nmore nuanced take on diasporic individuals’ ethnicities and the mechanisms through which\r\nthese ethnicities are made. I will do this by reconfiguring collectivist versions of diaspora into\r\nan individualised transdiasporic space, and redefining ethnicity as transdiasporic ethnicity.\r\nTransdiasporic ethnicities are made in the social intimacies and distances between individuals\r\nand between their ethnic lifestyles (sets of aesthetic markers). Such distances are affected by\r\nindividuals’ ethnic tastes – preferences for or against different lifestyles.\r\n\r\nMy arguments are based on a study of Chinese Singaporeans and their wedding rituals.\r\nWeddings are microcosms of transdiasporic space – multiple crossroads for intersecting\r\ndiasporic journeys and everyday lives. I will employ a visually-focussed form of participant\r\nobservation, arguing that the use of photographs with text creates a richer space to do\r\nsociological work. I will also develop a methodological framework of photography as visual\r\npoetry, creating an emotional texture that text alone struggles to achieve.\r\n\r\nChinese Singaporeans engage in outward-facing taste performances which reveal their ethnic\r\nlifestyles to others. Juxtaposed taste performances often lead to aesthetic dissonance, which\r\nencourages individuals to make decisions affecting their ethnic tastes. This tends to result in\r\nsocial distancing between two socially prominent ethnic lifestyles which were politically\r\ndefined and are now part of popular discourse – “heartlander” and “cosmopolitan”. These\r\nlifestyles are often held in tension and tend to be connected to different levels of economic\r\nwealth. Commercial activities in weddings perpetuate such linkages, such that socioeconomic\r\naspirations often texture ethnic tastes. I will conclude by considering what aesthetic\r\ndissonance says about concepts of ethnic hybridity and syncretism, and propose that a\r\nChinese Singaporean’s economic life-path continues to be affected by the ethnic lifestyles\r\nshe is socially intimate with.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heng, Terence"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999527,"sim:weight":0.200505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.194567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84888,"sim:weight":0.189887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.188613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108748,"sim:weight":0.178756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999497,"sim:weight":0.169644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447316,"sim:weight":0.163862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.14681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999538,"sim:weight":0.118041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, it will examine two South African photographic works which are paradigmatic of the political and social changes that marked the first decade after the fall of apartheid, focusing on the empowerment of both photographers and subjects. The first, Jillian Edelstein’s (2001) Truth \u0026 Lies: Stories from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, captures the faces and records the stories of perpetrators and victims who gave their testimonies to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa from 1996 to 2000. The second, Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin’s (2004a) Mr. Mkhize’s Portrait \u0026 Other Stories from the New South Africa, documents the changed/ unchanged realities of a democratic country ten years after apartheid.\r\n\r\nThe work of these photographers is showcased for its specificity, historicity and uniqueness. In both works the images are charged with emotion. Viewed on their own — uncaptioned — the photographs have the capacity to unsettle the viewer, but in both cases a compelling intermeshing of image and text heightens their resonance and enables further possibilities for interpretation. In their contributions to the critical theory of photography Roland Barthes, Victor Burgin and Max Kozloff underscore the centrality of the interplay between image and text in the meaning-making process anchoring a critical engagement with photography. Burgin (1982) states that “Even the uncaptioned photograph, framed and isolated on a gallery, is invaded by language when it is looked at”, and Kozloff (1987) claims that “However they are perceived, images have to be mediated by words”.\r\n\r\nThis thesis singles out emotionally charged and forceful photographs in Edelstein, Broomberg and Chanarin’s repertoire to consider both the complex process of the construction and interpretation of photographic meaning and question if/when photographs do, in fact, depend on language. Central to the architecture of photography is the layering of the representations, firstly through the specific photographic language and form of address which characterises the portrait genre, and secondly through the verbal text accompanying the images. I argue that the viewer’s experience of the photograph unfolds at two distinct moments of viewing. The first moment is defined by the “raw” encounter with the photograph — mediated by an affective response to its emotional or symbolic content — and the second moment encompasses the response to the photograph’s compositional elements, or signifying units, in articulation with the text/narrative accompanying it. \r\n\r\nThis analysis brings to the fore the relation and exchange between photographer and subject and, ultimately, between photographer, subject and viewer. Emmanuel Levinas and Hannah Arendt’s theoretical insights provide a platform for exploring the lived, concrete experience of ethical choice and action at the core of the photographer–subject-viewer humanistic triangulated relationship. Germane to this discussion, Ariella Azoulay’s (2008) conception of “the civil contract of photography” extends the possibility of questioning and/or examining, firstly, the complex intertwining roles of the several participants in the photographic act/encounter and, secondly, the photographic image as an intercultural nexus wherein photographer, subject and viewer meet.\r\nThe triangulation of photographer-subject-viewer, which constitutes the guiding thread of this study, is further explored and illuminated from the perspective of Mikhail Bakhtin’s conceptualisation of the “utterance”, enabling me to engage with the dialogical dimension of photographic practice. The affinities between Levinas and Bakhtin — two philosophers of alterity — revealed through a common language of responsibility in the relation with the other, inform my reading and discussion of the ethical project of photography in post-apartheid South Africa. \r\n\r\nPhenomenology, narrative theory and social semiotic visual analysis guide the methodology adopted in this study, creating a synergy between a reflective/dialogical, a discursive/sociological and a more semiological/aesthetic approach. From this perspective, my concern will be in establishing the interdisciplinarity between Visual Culture and Cultural Studies and, in so doing, I will explore the relationship between the photograph, documentary practice, social processes, modes of representation and/or visual testimony, confirming Irit Rogoff’s (1998) claim that “[I]mages do not stay within discrete disciplinary fields (…), since neither the eye nor the psyche operates along or recognizes such divisions. Instead they provide the opportunity for a mode of new cultural writing existing at the intersections of both objectivities and subjectivities”.","bibo:AuthorList":["Horta, Paula"],"dc:date":"2011-06-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43638,"sim:weight":0.705036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.685172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197509,"sim:weight":0.683342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352112,"sim:weight":0.648815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187781,"sim:weight":0.643707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383500,"sim:weight":0.640112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187748,"sim:weight":0.637474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.636146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8766858,"sim:weight":0.625465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.625343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768880,"sim:weight":0.615588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710496,"sim:weight":0.614709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5588456,"sim:weight":0.614402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382971,"sim:weight":0.613204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269897,"sim:weight":0.612773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109759,"sim:weight":0.611563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381993,"sim:weight":0.610434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187741,"sim:weight":0.608084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788826,"sim:weight":0.605715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383382,"sim:weight":0.605686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Despite their popularity, philosophical reflection about\r\nthem has largely been absent. Digital objects, in their simplest form, are data, which\r\nare further formalized through logical metadata schemes or ontologies. The\r\nformalized objects present themselves as data which are programmable objects which\r\nwe create, drag, delete, as well as networks which are created through logical\r\ninferences. The thesis will argue that investigation of natural objects by traditional\r\nmetaphysics fails to understand digital objects. It proposes to develop a new method\r\nbased on the conceptualisation of technical objects in Martin Heidegger and Gilbert\r\nSimondon’s works. Heidegger is important because he understands technical objects\r\nby situating them within their world, while Simondon treats them as an evolution\r\ntowards perfection. The thesis proposes synthesizing the ideas of these two thinkers\r\nthrough the concept of relations by studying the genesis of Markup languages from\r\nGML to the semantic web and the history of artificial intelligence, especially of what\r\nHubert Dreyfus calls Heideggerian AI. It develops a theory of relations from Hume\r\n(discursive relations) and Heidegger (existential relations) to analyse digital objects\r\ninstead of substance and hylomorphism. The analysis of relations helps us understand\r\nthe digital milieu as a technical system, which exhibits a dynamic between these two\r\nrelations and construct a new conception of temporality. The thesis further proposes\r\nto investigate experiences in the technical system through the analysis of both\r\ncognitive (Husserl) and existential (Heidegger) meaning by contrasting them with\r\ncomputational logic, algorithms and the extended mind hypothesis. In general, the\r\nthesis demonstrates a new approach and a philosophical understanding of\r\ncomputational objects, which is called machine phenomenology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hui, Yuk"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1555269,"sim:weight":0.35458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108253,"sim:weight":0.295043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108071,"sim:weight":0.260287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108318,"sim:weight":0.234486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445179,"sim:weight":0.22104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109063,"sim:weight":0.217578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.197826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.19645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":653007,"sim:weight":0.193853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223937,"sim:weight":0.184635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108414,"sim:weight":0.169946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I argue that ‘the transnational’ is a\r\n‘subset’ of migrant categories, and that Vietnamese transnational identities depend on the\r\nmeasurable activities in which they are involved. Important aspects of this research are:\r\nFirst, the Vietnamese are one of the first major non-British Commonwealth peoples to\r\nmigrate into the United Kingdom in the modern era. This has had implications related to\r\nsettlement into British society, overcome by the subsequent shift from refugee status to\r\ntransnational activity and identities, resulting in widespread Vietnamese transnational\r\nnetworks. Second, the Vietnamese represent one of the first ‘quota’ refugee populations\r\ngranted entry into the UK. Refugees were accepted prior to entering Britain, and upon\r\narrival, government and private support structures were provided. Also, Vietnamese\r\nrefugees underwent mandatory dispersal across the UK, a detrimental situation prompting a\r\nsubsequent intra-Britain migration to urban centres, particularly London. Third, Vietnamese\r\ncommunities in Britain have distinctive characteristics, making a study of identities and\r\nnetworks an interesting and useful one, particularly in light of developing research in\r\ntransnational studies. These characteristics include the Vietnamese North-South cultural and\r\nlinguistic ‘divide’, the presence of Vietnamese and Chinese-background Vietnamese, and\r\ndifferences in the timing and reasons for migration.\r\n\r\nKey research questions relate to transnational activities, identities, and community networks\r\nplayed out in the role, reach and specific pathways of those activities across national\r\nborders. Key questions are: ‘What does it mean to be a transnationally active Vietnamese\r\nLondoner?’ and ‘How are Vietnamese Londoners engaged in community-based\r\ntransnational networks?’ These questions are addressed using interviews, participant\r\nobservation, participation in Vietnamese-related conferences, and in informal conversations\r\non the street and in local Vietnamese shops.

Using this data, it examines the arguments of\r\na wide variety of Islamic scholars, clerics and activists and highlights some of the ways\r\nin which Islam is being related to the British context.\r\n\r\nOf particular concern in the thesis are the implications these debates have for liberal\r\ntraditions in the UK. It considers the effects of conventions of public discourse that\r\nseek to stifle the expression of religious ideas upon the possible future flourishing of\r\nBritish society and politics. The thesis argues against liberal political philosophies that\r\naim to restrict public speech so that only “public” or “secular” reasons are offered in\r\npolitical debates, arguing that to do this is to risk mutual isolation between the UK’s\r\nmany religious and secular moral traditions. It uses debates among Muslims in the UK\r\non subjects such as national identity, political participation and civil and Islamic law to\r\nillustrate and give weight to this argument.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2010-02-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5090427,"sim:weight":0.794124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43652,"sim:weight":0.791892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43669,"sim:weight":0.782957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.775069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1152075,"sim:weight":0.769639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090441,"sim:weight":0.767291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929831,"sim:weight":0.758758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.753056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108348,"sim:weight":0.726165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790273,"sim:weight":0.724827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051419,"sim:weight":0.718693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1060213,"sim:weight":0.714775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446416,"sim:weight":0.713641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.708801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48328,"sim:weight":0.705004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4152130,"sim:weight":0.687756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43809,"sim:weight":0.682614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43683,"sim:weight":0.678763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108931,"sim:weight":0.675119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767347,"sim:weight":0.673844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is not concerned with forging a definition of everyday sound as a category\r\nof sonic effects, but instead an analysis of the ways that the everyday, aural and\r\notherwise, is interpenetrating with our perceptual capacities and the cultural practices\r\nencompassing aural aesthetic production and experience.\r\n\r\nThis thesis extends extant discourses surrounding the notion that the experience of sound\r\nas meaningful and aesthetic is connected to our general experience as embodied beings in\r\nthe material world. The following analysis encompasses aspects of auditory perception,\r\nmusic aesthetics, and sound art production from the perspective of the body, as it is the\r\nlocus of the listening subject situated within the domain of everyday experience. This\r\nincludes an investigation of sound transduction technologies, as the devices that enable\r\naural aesthetic practice are central to its analysis in the context of the everyday. Listening\r\nattitudes are transformed through cultural practice, structuring the relationship between\r\nthe domain of the everyday, the embodied listening subject, sound recordings as cultural\r\nartefacts, and the attendant process of transduction.\r\n\r\nDiscourses that attribute non-material, disembodied understandings to aesthetic\r\nexperience are examined and challenged. From this, a fundamentally material, embodied\r\napproach to auditory experience is proposed, and with it a consideration of the ways that\r\nsound art and acousmatic music engage with the process of human understanding and the\r\nconstitution of meaning in sound. Self-reflexive methodologies in aural aesthetic practice\r\nare exemplified, with the aim of promoting an expanded conception of aural context that\r\nincludes the technological, cultural, and phenomenal aspects of its production.","bibo:AuthorList":["Keenan, Jeremy"],"dc:date":"2011-12-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1446415,"sim:weight":0.703073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.637066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447855,"sim:weight":0.584952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108381,"sim:weight":0.566473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223937,"sim:weight":0.557813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.529642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.521013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58923,"sim:weight":0.520159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108303,"sim:weight":0.514832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.512692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85354,"sim:weight":0.491608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443361,"sim:weight":0.460846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90836,"sim:weight":0.455427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109077,"sim:weight":0.425682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.388954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9321230,"sim:weight":0.344325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443364,"sim:weight":0.321967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69113,"sim:weight":0.26335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933445,"sim:weight":0.252846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9046388,"sim:weight":0.208893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This trajectory is used to uncover the places and operations of the typical £1 commodity and the ways in which it utilizes and creates a complicated array of tactics.\r\n\r\nEach of these tactics is explored in turn; from the embedding of a culture of immediacy, to the intrinsic necessity of disposability, to the creation of agglomerative logic, to the over-powering presence of abundance. Immediacy is explored in relation to the consumer and traditional notions of desire and mystification unpicked. Disposability is questioned in the context of the possibilities of entanglement with objects rather than possession of them. Agglomeration is analysed as a practice both contributing to, but in some ways hors de, capitalism, as well as a phenomenon carving out new types of spaces. Abundance is picked apart as one half of a double-edged relationship with scarcity and a way of understanding current rhetoric on fast capitalism.\r\n\r\nThe trinket is considered as part of both micro situations (for example, the solidarity of manufacturers in China‟s „commodity city‟ of Yiwu) and macro geo-political movements (the impact of China‟s growth on the relationship between China and the EU). Its tactics are considered in the light of current capitalism and some initial principles for a new material manifesto are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hulme, Alison"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.253129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23709,"sim:weight":0.248457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.247286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.244337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445655,"sim:weight":0.240945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930888,"sim:weight":0.238728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.237174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108033,"sim:weight":0.221666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.217412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930160,"sim:weight":0.209539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.207537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.154278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Through ethnographic fieldwork in an English eating disorders unit and with participants to pro-anorexia websites this anthropological research centrally explores relationships between personhood and illness as they are articulated and experienced by anorexic informants. Without assuming pro-anorexic desire to be either fully agential of just a product of the illness itself, the thesis traces the ebb and flow of informants’ desires for anorexia and the selves, bodies and anorexia(s) that such processes enact. Moving across these two field sites reveals not only how each illuminates pro-anorexia in the other, but also that both tangibly impact on ways in which informants experience and desire anorexia in the other. This thesis therefore suggests that in both spaces relationships between anorexia and personhood, agency and desire, bodies and eating, are perhaps both ‘virtual’ and ‘actual.’ Importantly, an analytic emphasis on exploring experiences and subjectivities, rather than on corporeal emaciation, seeks to listen to informants’ desires for anorexia whilst also recognising the realities of the illness. This reveals how desire and ambivalence are often conjoined as pro-anorexia signifies both a response to, and reconfiguration of, compromised conditions of possibility. By exploring ways in which seeming antitheses such as pro-anorexia and biomedicine or desire and ambivalence are not only related, but are mutually productive, in informants’ accounts, this thesis not only addresses the largely unexplored topic of pro-anorexia; it also reflects on the practices of anthropology itself, its ethics, ways of looking – or perhaps listening – and its modes of representation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lavis, Anna"],"dc:date":"2011-11-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45041,"sim:weight":0.603381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8791801,"sim:weight":0.45026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187603,"sim:weight":0.443672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10108,"sim:weight":0.425468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351000,"sim:weight":0.416568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.415089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710015,"sim:weight":0.411323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269897,"sim:weight":0.404734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43400,"sim:weight":0.404237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43639,"sim:weight":0.401322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199613,"sim:weight":0.390882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99475,"sim:weight":0.386628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16699,"sim:weight":0.386547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15239,"sim:weight":0.386433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710668,"sim:weight":0.38455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447898,"sim:weight":0.382638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101469,"sim:weight":0.379984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77164,"sim:weight":0.378099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48386,"sim:weight":0.373554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187621,"sim:weight":0.371206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This unravelling is accomplished theoretically through the historicised application of Lefebvre‘s spatial triad. Production of space histories and Castlefield‘s \u0027regeneration‘ are revisited principally through archival and interview evacuations of the neglected years of the 1970s. Urban public space is seen as the key city synecdoche. The thesis argues against what is called the \u0027dominant academic narrative‘: challenging the narrative where it ignores or downplays the role of counter-representations and counter-projects in the production of urban public space. The empirical research is based mainly on archival data and complimentary interview and visual data; the analyses are qualitative. Visual representations of space largely neglected in the literature are foregrounded throughout the empirical research. Spaces of representation and spatial practice are interrogated from the perspective of public space analysis which emphasises the importance of the contested nature of representations of space within the public sector and the vulnerable and unstable character of some official representations of space. The thesis therefore does not seek to reproduce what might be called a \u0027traditional‘ Lefebvrian analysis which counter-poses repressive official representations of space against quotidian heroic, poetic spaces of representation. The research challenges oversimplified characterisations of Castlefield as a space simply of heritage, leisure and exclusive residential enclaves. A dynamic, complex spatial portrait is revealed whereby ludic, \u0027natural‘ and abstract space rise and fall though intricate spatial layering as time unfolds. Urban differential space and ludic space are found to emerge through the interstices of abstract space as key outcomes of the contestation of space. The thesis concludes that the potential for differential urban public space exists through the production of new spaces and their diverse politicised appropriation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Leary, Michael"],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109122,"sim:weight":0.522178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.329506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.207763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.204338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.197165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.18707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.162654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.150838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109002,"sim:weight":0.141356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In\r\nLondon, a high proportion of casino customers are of Chinese origin, especially in those\r\ncasinos which are situated in the vicinity of Chinatown where I carried out fieldwork. In\r\nthe thesis, the nature of this relationship is reconsidered as a mutual encounter against\r\nthe political and economic background of the British gambling environment, a\r\nphenomenological description of gamblers’ actions when they are gambling and an\r\nexamination of how migration is experienced by different individuals.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to challenge the perception of gambling as an irrational activity which\r\npresupposes a restricted conception of time, economic rationality and success. As such,\r\nthis thesis focuses on Chinese gamblers’ ideas of luck, fate and greed and reflects on the\r\ndifferent ideas of success that emerge from risk taking of various kinds including in\r\nbusiness, through migration and last, but not least, in the casino. It demonstrates that the\r\nrelationship between time and money cannot be assumed but must be reconsidered in\r\nsitu through the way individuals create and experience different temporalities and\r\nrationalities via the circulation of money. The casino is a particularly illuminating place\r\nsince the articulation of time and money is constructed in contrast with the notion of\r\ntime discipline that dominates most other life rhythms. This means that even though the\r\ncirculation of money and the flow of time may be suspended or slowed down in the\r\naftermath of the migration journey, the space of the casino, with its contained spatiotemporality,\r\nstill offers the opportunity to experience movement in a repeated and\r\nsystematic manner.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, this thesis shows how Chinese people in London shape and re-shape\r\ntheir selves forming different temporalities and using various ways of exchanging\r\nmoney.","bibo:AuthorList":["Loussouarn, Claire"],"dc:date":"2010-07-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108497,"sim:weight":0.241788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.200939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.195116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.192714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Identifying embeddedness as a motif of contextual proximity and a strategy in contemporary art, the thesis proposes immediacy to be the result of intrinsic mediation. The project’s main concern is how embeddedness is contextualised by the current conditions that authors and cultural producers engage with. The primary question is whether and how embeddedness can convey a critical relation to the mediation that it undertakes. These concerns inform and arise from my work as an artist, and my participation in events, some of which I organise. The project claims that embeddedness in art is a critical condition and an editorial concept or a strategic plan that can be set up by the artist.\r\n\r\nThe investigation begins by looking at conditions of embeddedness by focusing on concepts of subjectivity and by elaborating strategies that I call ‘auto-direction’. For example, concepts of subjectivity are taken up in relation to Richard Serra’s video Boomerang (1974), in which the performer Nancy Holt reflects on her own spoken words, which are fed back with a short delay via microphone and headphones into her ears. Auto-direction, introduced with the example of Steven Spielberg’s initiative of a video diary exchange project between Israeli and Palestinian children, describes the activity of the producer, who self-directs his situated presence. Taking up idioms of embeddedness from artists like Phil Collins, Christian Jankowski and Erik van Lieshout the project examines embeddedness through a comparative analysis between contemporary art, visual culture, media theory, sociology, art theory, psychoanalysis and philosophy. These practices lead to an identification of embeddedness as an author’s immanent exposure, a claim taken up through analysis of theoretical texts and literature by Rosalind Krauss, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Gregory Bateson, Hal Foster, Bernard Williams and Alfred North Whitehead.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maier, Johannes"],"dc:date":"2011-11-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":107036,"sim:weight":0.2046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this research was to investigate the consequences of implementing a specially devised strategic planning model in individual schools in Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nTwelve schools of average size were chosen as a representative sample: four elementary, four middle and four secondary schools. Interviews with senior management suggested a general lack of awareness of strategic planning at school level and some resistance to giving more autonomy to schools.\r\n\r\nThe Makhdoom Strategic Planning Model, which has a distinctive vision-led format, was proposed and adopted in the sample schools. Perceived benefits included participants choosing their own vision for the school, sharing views and contributing to the decision- making process. Problems were discovered and discussed during initial interviews, subsequent workshops, and final interviews with school staff: lack of information and resistance to change were identified as the main potential challenges to introducing the Model into schools. Some compromises would be needed to avoid conflict with the central system. Leadership from head teachers and the availability of a facilitator were important factors for success.\r\n\r\nIn addition to extending understanding of the value of strategic planning in the context of the Saudi Arabian education system at school level, this thesis presents an easily applicable, vision-led, 10-step Strategic Planning Model which can be used by managers in many other educational contexts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Makhdoom, Ahmad"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.4481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.435452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.43503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.426315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.421882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.41233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.411173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Summary descriptions can be based on set sizes that are beyond the capacity of focussed attention, leading to the proposal that a distributed attention mechanism, statistical processing, underlies this process (Chong and Treisman, 2003, 2005a, 2005b; Chong et al. 2008; Treisman, 2006). However, the conclusion that summary descriptions are formed by a mechanism involving distributed attention has been questioned on the basis of parsimony, and a proposal for the role of focussed attention strategies in producing these summary descriptions has been made (Myzcek \u0026 Simons, 2008; Simons \u0026 Myzcek, 2008; see also De Fockert \u0026 Marchant, 2008). \r\n\r\nThe aim of this thesis was to further elucidate the process of set representation by statistical properties, exploring the evidence that the summary description is given preferential representational status over individual items (Chapter 2), that summary descriptions can be produced within the known capacity limits of focussed attention (Chapter 3), that the results found in these experiments are not affected by the development of a prototypical average across the experimental session (Chapter 4), and that similar summary descriptions may also be rapidly extracted from more complex stimuli (Chapter 5). These findings are discussed in the context of current average size perception theory, and the proposal of a dual process view of set representation by statistical properties is briefly outlined. The dual process view combines both focussed attention when stimulus complexity is low and/or cognitive resources are available and distributed attention when stimulus complexity is high and/or cognitive resources are restricted. Finally, a selection of further studies and research areas that follow from the current research and the dual process view are briefly detailed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marchant, Alexander"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84951,"sim:weight":0.300677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84704,"sim:weight":0.281171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.266404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.254337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85049,"sim:weight":0.252371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85083,"sim:weight":0.203435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.202583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69994,"sim:weight":0.178368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26675,"sim:weight":0.168979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108964,"sim:weight":0.158693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85539,"sim:weight":0.143434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85300,"sim:weight":0.133267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The exhibition is inspired in part by theories of decline, repetition and nomenclature, which are explored in Oswald Spengler\u0027s seminal and infamous work the \"Decline of the West\" 1918. Spengler\u0027s text describes the self-destructive force of the West as both a form of nature and a consequence of human action. This marks the prophesy of the inevitable fall of power as we know it, towards the disintegration of all western value, most particularly the luxury of our very human ability to order and reason the objects of knowledge, as well as the end to the material luxury of money.\r\n\r\nThe participating artists all explore various aspects and nuances of contemporary symbolic economies, encompassing paradigms from aristocracy and the elite, politics and the image of law, to advertising and popular culture. Most particularly, the works address often directly, the point at which art conditions itself as the primary object of such luxury and its particpation in these processes of power. In The Edge of Luxury, Form and Actuality, the artists invite the viewer to explore these symbolic spaces, objects and images from the vantage point of this edge. Here, the idea of this image-power is taken in its entropy delivered in formal disintegration, and it is newly unbound in the emergence and potentialisation of new and compelling forms of actuality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Alison","Beech, Amanda","Glass , Kirsten"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.267482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445490,"sim:weight":0.25405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443360,"sim:weight":0.254017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.23874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.233647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443361,"sim:weight":0.23082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.211094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.210852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.185565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Critically, I draw centrally upon Rosi\r\nBraidotti (1994) and Donna Haraway’s (1992; 2004) work on figurations\r\nas feminist metaphors theorizing how women challenge and transform\r\nsocially constructed roles that confine females to subservient social\r\npositions. In addition, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s (1987)\r\ntheorization of multiplicity is deployed as a useful conceptualization of\r\nthe erasure of the binary separating the collective and individual, asserting\r\ninstead, that subjectivities are pluralistic, connected identities in constant\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplying the critics’ ideas with due caution to the African context,\r\nthrough a method of ‘carnivalizing,’ mixing and negotiating theory, my\r\nthesis also makes use of selected forms of African feminist theory, to give\r\nthe necessary cultural context to Zimbabwean femininity. I critically\r\nengage with scholarly work that theorizes African women’s\r\nhistoriography and negotiations of power and knowledge. Combining\r\nthese diverse feminist and post-structuralist voices together with views\r\nexpressed in the writing, I aim to produce a nuanced reading of the\r\nplurality of femininity so that a pattern of simultaneously complimentary\r\nand contradictory relations with feminist paradigms of African\r\nwomanhood begins to emerge as key to interpreting the selected fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy thesis develops in three chapters, beginning with an examination of\r\nhow rebellious women negotiate the domestic, private world culturally\r\nassigned to females. I explore how Vera’s unconventional figurations of\r\nmotherhood undo the cultural and political mores placed on women by\r\nessentialist patriarchal and racial ideologies. Further analyzing dissenting\r\nfemininities, I investigate subversive textual constructions of same-sex\r\nrelationships in Vera and Dangarembga’s fiction. My readings suggest\r\nthat some of the ideological contradictions between theory and text\r\nprovide fertile conditions in which to rethink radical femininities as\r\nfigurations within African feminism. I propose new, progressive strategies\r\nfor reading womanhood, and exploring the polyphonic and complex\r\nnature of colonial and post-independence Zimbabwean femininity, as\r\nexpressed in the novels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marima, Tendai"],"dc:date":"2011-02-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381919,"sim:weight":0.752589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710015,"sim:weight":0.746776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":678093,"sim:weight":0.720009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187741,"sim:weight":0.714067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45520,"sim:weight":0.700943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48296,"sim:weight":0.686307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99497,"sim:weight":0.684249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98806,"sim:weight":0.674714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930364,"sim:weight":0.657334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187501,"sim:weight":0.64581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43663,"sim:weight":0.640507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.631923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43024,"sim:weight":0.625848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199613,"sim:weight":0.62493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383350,"sim:weight":0.623231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53550,"sim:weight":0.621362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187537,"sim:weight":0.621159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":747277,"sim:weight":0.616854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45121,"sim:weight":0.615644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109759,"sim:weight":0.611633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":1447790,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Precarious Labour in Portuguese Call Centres: An Anthropological Study","bibo:abstract":"This thesis explores the themes of alienation and exploitation within the Portuguese call centre sector by focusing on the nature of value-creation in the organisation of labour, the effects this regime has on workers’ consciousness and agency, and how these effects are expressed in terms of class, gender and age. These questions are examined within the broader political and economic context.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the ‘call centre domain’ in Portugal has been transformed into the main symbol of precariedade laboral (labour precariousness). The categories of trabalho precário (precarious labour), trabalhador precário (precarious worker) and precariedade laboral (labour precariousness) have recently entered into everyday language in Portugal. They are used by politicians and journalists as well as social movements and citizens as a way of protesting against the growing insecurity, contingency and vulnerability of formal wage employment as is found, for instance, in the increase of ‘atypical forms of employment’ such as temporary agency work. Call centres have been described as ‘electronic sweatshops’ because of such characteristics as repetitive tasks, high turnover, stress and burnout, psychological aggression from ‘angry’ customers, low autonomy in work tasks and automatism (scripting), leading to the stereotype of call centre workers as ‘human answering machines’.\r\n\r\nMy research argues that, in the call centre labour regime workers are subjected to management by tight surveillance which robs humans of their defining characteristics of creative/symbolic thinking and complex communication and language. This management also imposes a gendered division of labour which separates men working in technical support help lines from women working in commercial help lines. The dispossession of call centre operators from what they do comes both from the gap between their expectations of and aspirations to social mobility, which were inculcated through their circles of socialization (family, state, school), and the feeling of ‘falling from grace’ after finishing their college degrees and having to enter into call centre\r\nwork. This is a form of work which is not only socially perceived as unskilled, inferior and lacking career options, but most importantly as a form of work in which humans are disguised as robots. I conclude by situating my main findings within the anthropological and sociological scholarship related to the nature of value-creation in the capitalist labour process, gender commodification and the subjective experience of dispossession, downward class mobility and stigma.","bibo:AuthorList":["Matos, Patricia RMA"],"dc:date":"2010-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69611,"sim:weight":0.606101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1134417,"sim:weight":0.572956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81171,"sim:weight":0.55703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.549935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.545989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9026996,"sim:weight":0.542918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.535858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.52599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.521759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7374550,"sim:weight":0.508199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447316,"sim:weight":0.501169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85451,"sim:weight":0.50085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.498854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.498854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200128,"sim:weight":0.492798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":551842,"sim:weight":0.485788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":899279,"sim:weight":0.476396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.475749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10751,"sim:weight":0.473951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":551681,"sim:weight":0.469504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

After fifty years of almost total extinction this form of communication has been revived, shifting from the fields where it was once used by peasant islanders and into the space of the classroom. Here, it is integrated into the curriculum of the island’s schools while providing children with a rich cultural platform that instigates linguistic and auditory experimentation. As a response to this transformation, the need to develop didactic materials is presented as one of the main challenges encountered by the community. Taking this condition as the driver of its research, this body of work draws on phonological, bioacoustic and cognitive theories to develop a formal understanding of the Silbo Gomero in a way which aims to complement the whistler’s own experience and mastery of the language by also developing an ethnographic reading of this indigenous body of knowledge and its characteristic auditory perceptual ecology. The investigation has culminated in the design of a digital application, El Laberinto del Sonido, and its active use within the educational community of the island. Finally, emphasising the practice-based nature of the research, this thesis attempts to relocate the question of intangible heritage from a focus on cultural safeguarding and transmission to one of experimentation, where an indigenous body of knowledge not only provides new exploratory paradigms in the design of didactic materials, but also contributes towards the sustainability of culturally situated forms of apprenticeship within contemporary educational contexts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Matos, Sonia"],"dc:date":"2010-07-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.627191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.597984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.591915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.576518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.557703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.548449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.515375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2691340,"sim:weight":0.511949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108381,"sim:weight":0.509999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108130,"sim:weight":0.509164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49016,"sim:weight":0.507745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1035277,"sim:weight":0.50457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102157,"sim:weight":0.50245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.493645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.493645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6203405,"sim:weight":0.49089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.487575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78037,"sim:weight":0.48684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102154,"sim:weight":0.484502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109077,"sim:weight":0.474263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although little agency is overtly ascribed to women, the study demonstrates how some women and disadvantaged men manage to overcome the constraints in their lives either by utilising the existing structures of marriage to their advantage or else by engaging in entrepreneurial activities, alone or with others, to improve their economic situations. It shows how the various forms of marriage help individuals to achieve full personhood in Kuria terms. The study explains why people wish to have many children and how they are able to overcome infertility, and even death, to increase the number of their descendants. \r\n\r\nTaking a historical perspective, the study is positioned against the backdrop of Kuria marriages. It looks at the ways these unions are tied into and shaped by wider social structures, including the laws and ideologies of Christianity, Islam, and the state in its various forms. The study concentrates more on local meanings than on legal or political rules. Despite far reaching politico-economic, religious and cultural changes, the Kuria have continued to tenaciously embrace their main ideas about marriage and fertility in relation to personhood. This is seen as a form of resistance, best understood in terms of the structures of agnatic descent and processes of individual agency, reflected in status and access to rights and resources in the community. Moreover, new stimuli in the local economy, like mining, have created market for local produce and services enabling households, individuals and groups to have various income-generation activities. The study argues that gender is flexible; it can be negotiated and circumvented by pragmatic changes in roles and status, rendering gendered identities a highly fluid process. Thus sonless or childless, living or non-living, and wealthy women can have daughters-in-law (female wives), and men who are dead, disabled, impotent or sterile, and mad can have children. Gender is also, however, in other senses circumscribed and fixed, because only women can bear children.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mhando, Nandera"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.368068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108302,"sim:weight":0.351466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57213,"sim:weight":0.347376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.344756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108193,"sim:weight":0.330899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.324435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.295819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.289016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85449,"sim:weight":0.244184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While there has been wide research into a variety of aspects of the BBC during the inter-war years, to date there has been only cursory consideration of the role of women in the Company/Corporation. The BBC is a particularly significant organisation to study because women worked at all levels, apart from the very top; as charwomen and kitchen hands; as secretaries and clerical staff; as drama producers, advertising representatives and Children’s Hour Organisers. Prior to the Second World War, three women, Hilda Matheson, Mary Somerville and Isa Benzie, attained Director status. The BBC viewed itself as a progressive employer, one that supported equal promotion prospects and equal pay. However, understated sexual discrimination was commonplace and in 1932, a Marriage Bar was introduced. The practice of marriage bars was widespread in the inter-war years yet the BBC was never fully committed to its bar and ‘exceptional’ married women and women judged to be useful to the Corporation continued to be employed and retained. This study considers the many different experiences of women and work at the BBC: married and single, waged and the salaried, young and old; graduate and non-graduate. As well as positioning itself within the historiography of the BBC, this thesis is the first to offer a detailed analysis of women’s employment in a large inter-war institution, one in which women’s experience of work was largely positive. It thus broadens both our understanding of the BBC and also offers new insights into women’s working lives in the 1920s and 1930s.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murphy, Catherine"],"dc:date":"2011-02-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":82004,"sim:weight":0.513521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44671,"sim:weight":0.492924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":221510,"sim:weight":0.488539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82889,"sim:weight":0.481979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4951,"sim:weight":0.480868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151290,"sim:weight":0.470868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":753,"sim:weight":0.462953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4159474,"sim:weight":0.45644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4161044,"sim:weight":0.456381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":221281,"sim:weight":0.435621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82936,"sim:weight":0.433882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9024975,"sim:weight":0.428421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3393,"sim:weight":0.424541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661837,"sim:weight":0.419987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42083,"sim:weight":0.397109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71806,"sim:weight":0.395721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":219507,"sim:weight":0.395429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":222108,"sim:weight":0.393833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8791947,"sim:weight":0.391545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68087,"sim:weight":0.391228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

From their first dealings up until 1968 – when official relations were established – and beyond, the Community and Yugoslavia never achieved a stable relationship that would have come into its own with the outbreak of the Yugoslav crisis in the early 1990s. In this respect, economic, political and social dimensions characterizing cooperation between the EC and the SFRY are analyzed to illustrate the developments between the two parties.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the Yugoslav crisis was a completely new phenomenon for Brussels. Although admittedly unprepared, EC officials stated that ‘the hour for Europe has come’. This eleventh-hour intervention, however, opened the door to certain non-state actors who became involved and, more importantly, affected the decision-making at EC level leading to the policy of recognition of Slovenia and Croatia as independent states, and thus the demise of the Yugoslav federation. The thesis focuses on the activism of diaspora communities, the media and the Catholic Church. \r\n\r\nAs far as the diaspora communities are concerned, their activism was most significant in Austria, a country that enjoyed an outstanding reputation within the European Community at the time. The Carinthian Slovenes used their position within Austrian politics to promote the independence of Slovenia and Croatia. As to the Western media, their reporting of the Yugoslav crisis, with its sympathy for the independence of the two republics, was accepted as a reliable source of information, a view confirmed by statements from Brussels. Finally, the Catholic Church also expressed sympathy for Slovenia and Croatia: the fact that the two SFRY republics were Catholic was reason enough for the Vatican to campaign for their independence at EC level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Radeljic, Branislav"],"dc:date":"2010-07-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.267906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":658880,"sim:weight":0.244654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.182636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929824,"sim:weight":0.181466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109140,"sim:weight":0.173727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The thesis focuses in particular on the issue dynamics concerning children as constructions of a “deserving poor” and immigrants as constructions of an “undeserving poor”.\r\n\r\nA frame analysis of mainstream news content in both countries demonstrates the extent to which individualizing and rationalizing frames dominate coverage, and that the publication of the news online is not leading to an expansion of discourses, as hoped. A frame analysis of alternative news coverage and coverage from the 1960s and 70s demonstrates significant absences of social justice frames and rights-based discourse in contemporary coverage. I suggest that mainstream news coverage narrows and limits the way poverty is talked about in a way that reinforces the dominance of neoliberalism and market-based approaches to the issue. Interviews with journalists, politicians, researchers and activists collectively indicate that getting media coverage is essential to gaining political attention in both countries. These interviews also reveal the power dynamics influencing the relationships between these actors and the way the issue of poverty is approached. I argue that while new media tools create new opportunities to share information, these tools are also creating new pressures by speeding up the working practices in mediated political centres in a way that forecloses potentials to challenge dominant news coverage and approaches to poverty. However, this cross-national comparison also reveals context-specific factors influencing poverty politics in each country. \r\n\r\nI conclude that this analysis and comparison of poverty issue dynamics reveals shortcomings in the democratic processes in both countries. Changing poverty coverage and approaches to the issue will require changing specific media and political practices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Redden, Joanna"],"dc:date":"2010-07-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930362,"sim:weight":0.297646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929894,"sim:weight":0.261002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.229196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.19763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447821,"sim:weight":0.196141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780590,"sim:weight":0.187016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.169973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.168248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Where appropriate, reference is made to surviving publicity surrounding original productions such as playbills and reviews and, in order to locate the work within a concrete culture of production and consumption, to available data on the minor theatres in which it was performed. The theoretical underpinning of this study draws on a range of existing arguments surrounding the relationship between melodrama and modernity, but also on the work of urban theorists and cultural historians who have identified the metropolis as a significant catalyst in the formation of modernity.\r\n\r\nAfter outlining the conceptual framework and reviewing existing literature in the field, chapters continue with discussions of the emergence of proletarian protagonists in melodrama and their relationship with developing notions of metropolitan class consciousness; melodramatic representations of metropolitan space and the dynamics of movement through that space; nostalgic stagings of the rural past; melodrama’s relationship to Simmelian notions of metropolitan ‘mental life’; and the synergies between melodrama, the spectacular, and metropolitan culture. The overall aim is to add to current understanding of how melodrama interpreted the shifting physical forms and subjective and social experience of the early nineteenth-century city, but also how the city itself shaped, limited and enabled the forms of expression adopted by melodramatists.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reid, Margaret"],"dc:date":"2011-09-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.614819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8770995,"sim:weight":0.598662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631953,"sim:weight":0.590727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182178,"sim:weight":0.579973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731430,"sim:weight":0.575053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.566456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":328800,"sim:weight":0.562451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.561611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13242,"sim:weight":0.558616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108361,"sim:weight":0.557409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709920,"sim:weight":0.555209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382483,"sim:weight":0.544505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99779,"sim:weight":0.544416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631624,"sim:weight":0.535317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631941,"sim:weight":0.52291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9039648,"sim:weight":0.518519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.517293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43172,"sim:weight":0.516546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43539,"sim:weight":0.514814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15239,"sim:weight":0.509699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It considers how this issue was contended between art critics such as Greenberg and Michael Fried and artists that challenged the formalist account of painting´s medium specificity through a wide range of procedures and techniques. I review Thierry de Duve´s analysis of Robert Ryman´s work in regard to Greenberg´s understanding of modernist painting and discuss the ways in which the contest between painting and photography (since photography made painting reproducible) is central.  \r\n\r\nThe analysis of Ryman´s work leads to a consideration of Duchamp´s readymade and its significance to painting. Painting´s resistance to being annexed by photography follows de Duve´s contention in regard to painting-photography competitiveness where he argues that opposition to photographic reproducibility has been critical for painting since the invention of photography. At this point the historical significance of Duchamp´s readymade is regarded as a repetition of the invention of photography within the domain of painting.\r\n\r\nThe assertion is then that the key to contemporary abstract painting – what supports its attraction – is the manner in which the construction of surface is made through the reformulation of pictorial practices that were developed from the 1960s – such as Informel – and continue to be elaborated in a contemporary context in the works of artists like Katharina Grosse or Sergej Jensen. By considering Informel as a manifestation of a painting-photography contest I argue for its value in contemporary abstract painting as a means to further develop abstract painting´s potentiality, as Katharina Grosse and Sergej Jensen do through their engagement with architectural space.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ruiz, Miguel Mathus"],"dc:date":"2011-05-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443361,"sim:weight":0.512886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.201911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84996,"sim:weight":0.191837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.170643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.146249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.144355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.126021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929930,"sim:weight":0.121148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Unlike both multiculturalism and anti-racism, whiteness theorists suggest that whiteness can be seen not as a biological fact, but as a social construction, and seek to examine white behaviour and assumptions as a first step toward resisting that behaviour. While its place in the academic world seems secure, its theories have had a limited impact on practitioners, particularly in Britain. Despite urgent calls by many writers in the field of whiteness studies, the number of white teachers attempting to understand how their own ethnicity affects their work appears negligible. In this paper I seek to begin to address that problem by applying a model of white attitudes to my own thinking and behaviour as a white teacher in a multi-ethnic primary school. It is suggested that this act of recording and reporting on the taken-for-granted behaviour of whites must be the first step toward decentring whiteness, and thus of providing a more equitable education for all children.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pearce, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2003-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383595,"sim:weight":0.662716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44868,"sim:weight":0.587319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381999,"sim:weight":0.547002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778976,"sim:weight":0.541102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999497,"sim:weight":0.527486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108621,"sim:weight":0.518495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.515972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.493489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710015,"sim:weight":0.492438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382060,"sim:weight":0.491941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89116,"sim:weight":0.478525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.474107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.473026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383349,"sim:weight":0.472139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446416,"sim:weight":0.4716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.468509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381950,"sim:weight":0.46486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.462284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75773,"sim:weight":0.459108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45883,"sim:weight":0.458897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Composers had the early advantage of producing durable manuscripts, while performers prior to the age of recording were unable to leave more than impressions in the minds of those who heard them. With the recent successes of numerous investigations into performance and recordings, including the CHARM and CMPCP projects, such studies are becoming ever more viable and significant.\r\n\r\nThe thesis focuses on the violinist Jascha Heifetz (1901-1987) and primarily his performances of the Bach solo violin works (BWV 1001-1006). While there have been studies of individual pieces, of particular performers, and of multiple recordings of the same piece, a study focussing on specific repertoire played by a specific performer is something that has been somewhat overlooked in the literature. The thesis draws on numerous methods to distil what is distinctive and unique about Heifetz. This includes an examination of what and how the performer played, why the performer played that way, and how that way of playing compares to other performers. The study concludes with a discussion of Heifetz’s unique performer profile in the context of violin performance history.\r\n\r\nFocussing on one of the most famous and successful performing musicians of the twentieth century along with some of the most frequently played pieces, this case study will suggest research methods and approaches transferable to related studies. The thesis draws on original interviews with former Heifetz students, friends, and colleagues, and on over thirteen months of archival research in the Jascha Heifetz Collection held by the Library of Congress. This array of previously untapped material aided the analytical and empirical investigations into Heifetz’s uniqueness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sarlo, Dario"],"dc:date":"2010-07-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76634,"sim:weight":0.286755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.282958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108905,"sim:weight":0.267456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57372,"sim:weight":0.250088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58755,"sim:weight":0.222589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108179,"sim:weight":0.214565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.192453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108619,"sim:weight":0.191757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.189927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447316,"sim:weight":0.187597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84822,"sim:weight":0.174324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75570,"sim:weight":0.173203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58823,"sim:weight":0.171757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although it is now commonplace to presume the objectifying gesture of documentary photography, the complex question of how, as a working artist/photographer, to approach the archive has not yet been adequately addressed. The purpose of this research is to raise questions about how, after the critique of the documentary image, the artist/photographer addresses, indeed, finds the archive. I am starting with the assumption that the archive is not only a place of storage but also a place of production, where our relation to the past is materialised and where our present writes itself into the future; thus, accordingly, I understand the archive as a place of negotiation and writing.\r\n\r\nAfter the problems of the archive have been identified theoretically, the practice in the archive still encounters challenges and contradictions. This project explores those difficulties that remain within the practice in and around the archive, even after the critique has been stated. It is not about simply extending the critique, but finding an archive and the practice with it.\r\n\r\nI am approaching these questions as a practitioner. As an artist and photographer, I am concerned with two practices in relation to archives: working with existing archives, and making work that will itself be archived. The point raised by those two activities is not to find or create another institutional archive per se, but to develop an archival practice in which the set of problems that the archives produce is in fact part of the process one engages in. Hence the work is a theoretical and practical set of experiments that may never be complete and conclusive.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schaber, Ines"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.646291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.605209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443360,"sim:weight":0.601048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445490,"sim:weight":0.600696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.590041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.589915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.588727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.586523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.580388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.568617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145943,"sim:weight":0.555403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":827626,"sim:weight":0.555084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.554298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447847,"sim:weight":0.553268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1635121,"sim:weight":0.551585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43380,"sim:weight":0.540315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.532813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":941,"sim:weight":0.532599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.532584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.52939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This thesis provides a critical focus upon talent by evaluating the way it features in popular music. This begins via an engagement with Kant and then Bourdieu in order to locate talent within the vocabulary of ideas that Kant develops in relation to both aesthetics and then genius. It also interrogates exceptionality and generates a critical framework around the questions that Kant leaves unanswered.\r\n\r\nThe thesis draws upon the author’s career as musician/producer/songwriter and the experiences of a cross-section of individuals involved in the music industry. As part of a varied qualitative approach, forty-eight semi-structured interviews were conducted alongside an overview of the change that has taken place in the music industry over the last five years. This material is situated within a Bourdieuian critical framework that considers talent in terms of both narrative and traditional understandings of the music industry. This discussion references popular music studies writing in order to explore the intersection of talent with a number of key themes that have informed debates over popular music: Romanticism, authenticity, amateurism/professionalism, success and inclusivity/exclusivity. The value of this research resides in the way in which it delineates talents centrality to all of these areas. Here, it is suggested that talent has a specific range of meanings that are shown to be contested in very particular ways. Moreover, its endurance as a term evidences its natural and historical centrality to the process of discovery; the unearthing of new acts that will energise the market for popular music. Through an evaluation of developing areas like branding, new media, interactivity and live music this thesis argues that the concept of talent is central to the strategies and struggles that take place within popular music.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sledmere, Adrian"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The first two studies investigated what reasons/issues may be involved in the negative feelings that a victim of bullying may feel and how these related to different types of bullying. The content analysis yielded seven themes: helplessness, persistency, fright, anonymity, no avoidance, embarrassment and loneliness. Study Three used quantitative methods to examine various issues such as gender and age differences, but especially the distribution of the bullying material, the role of bystanders, and whether cyberbullies feel more or less remorse compared to traditional bullies. Findings showed that cyberbullies not only targeted their victims, but quite often showed the material to other people and/or uploaded it onto the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe bystanders of cyberbullying mostly did nothing further to distribute the material, however when they did, they tended to help the victim more often than bully him/her further. When asked about feelings of remorse, cyberbullies expressed less remorse than traditional bullies. The findings are discussed in relation to the\r\ndefinition of bullying, and the need for empathy raising awareness for bullies within the cyberbullying context. Study Four, a qualitative study, involved 10 pupils and examined issues such as what the pupils had experienced (as victims, bullies or bystanders), how it felt (impact), and how it was resolved.\r\n\r\nPractical implications of the findings include the highlighted need for different coping strategies to be applied for victims of cyberbullying and traditional bullying,\r\nas well as starting preventive strategies for cyberbullying in pupils as young as 7 years. In addition, the need to investigate cyberbullying in a different manner than that of traditional bullying is raised. This could have practical implications for researchers, but is also a theoretical concern related to the definition of cyberbullying.","bibo:AuthorList":["Slonje, Robert"],"dc:date":"2011-03-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":677153,"sim:weight":0.771503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767434,"sim:weight":0.726496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5067167,"sim:weight":0.723733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999528,"sim:weight":0.687404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4153043,"sim:weight":0.681286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":741557,"sim:weight":0.652229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4150618,"sim:weight":0.638733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586652,"sim:weight":0.606738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5066511,"sim:weight":0.600417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48776,"sim:weight":0.583788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1098467,"sim:weight":0.575513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":888531,"sim:weight":0.568073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9028441,"sim:weight":0.567665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710167,"sim:weight":0.52405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795072,"sim:weight":0.508313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1039792,"sim:weight":0.484896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":221828,"sim:weight":0.465886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586659,"sim:weight":0.440408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586658,"sim:weight":0.439206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9014841,"sim:weight":0.340677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The focus is on one of these communities, a music filesharing website called ‘OiNK’. Founded in 2005, it was the first of its kind to garner membership in the hundreds of thousands, was emblematic of user-led movements to improve the quality, efficiency and availability of digital media online, and was very publically shut down in 2007. \r\n\r\nMaking critical use of Simondon’s notion of ‘individuation’, two interrelated techno-historical impulses are identified as central to the ‘in-formation’ of both BitTorrent and OiNK. Firstly, through research into the development of the global music industry’s ‘productive circuit’ of manufacturing, distribution, retail and radio, it is shown how consumers were gradually excluded from having a say in how, what and where they could consume. Secondly, a history of ‘OiNK-style’ filesharing is gleaned, not from P2P, but from research into small, decentralised ‘online’ communities that emerged throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s, where enthusiasts learned how to use software and hardware to manage the storage, reproduction, uploading and sharing of information. \r\n\r\nThis thesis shows how BitTorrent exposed these previously exclusive practices to masses of consumers who were dissatisfied with both retail/broadcasting and public P2P, through the new possibility of private BitTorrent communities. Through a case study of OiNK, encompassing in-depth interviews with ex-members, screenshots and technical analysis, this thesis shows how OiNK gathered a large and diverse online cache of ‘archival grade’ recorded music, bringing old and deleted music back into circulation and amassing a core of fanatically committed members. It accounts for a nascent form of online community, where large member-bases manage every aspect of the reproduction and circulation of digital artefacts, and at higher levels of quality/efficiency than legal alternatives.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sockanathan, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930215,"sim:weight":0.214187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26473,"sim:weight":0.20922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.206476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.194471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930219,"sim:weight":0.182754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929823,"sim:weight":0.159089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.113528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":1447821,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Making Global Publics? Communication and Knowledge Production in the World Social Forum Process","bibo:abstract":"This thesis provides an in-depth empirical analysis of the character and significance of media and communication in the World Social Forum (WSF), focusing on their relationship to processes of knowledge production. Using the concept of publics as a theoretical tool, it explores how, through mediated communication, forum organisers and communication activists seek to extend the WSF in time and space and thereby make it public. Engaging critically with the idea of the WSF as a global process, the thesis considers how mediated communication might contribute to making the WSF global, not so much in absolute terms as by creating a sense of globality, and how the idea of the global relates to other scales. It develops an understanding of the WSF as an epistemic project that seeks both to affirm the existence and validity of multiple knowledges and to facilitate convergence between them, and considers how different communication practices might further this project.\r\n\r\nBased on ethnographic research carried out in connection with the WSF 2009 in Belém, complemented by fieldwork at other social forums, the thesis is structured as a series of case studies of different communication practices, ranging from efforts to engage with conventional mass media to various initiatives that seek to strengthen movement-based communication infrastructures and enable WSF participants to communicate on their own terms. These demonstrate that there are many different approaches to making the WSF \u0027public\u0027 and \u0027global\u0027, which beyond facilitating the circulation of media content also involve mobilising new actors to participate in media production and generating a sense of identification with a global WSF process. They also show that mediated communication can contribute to knowledge production not only by facilitating information sharing, but also through the more subtle processes of empowerment, network-building, and translation across difference it can stimulate when embedded in movement dynamics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stephansen, Hilde"],"dc:date":"2011-07-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":105952,"sim:weight":0.594855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.551501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929869,"sim:weight":0.477421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447394,"sim:weight":0.45869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447393,"sim:weight":0.433348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.412102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":858,"sim:weight":0.40499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9035279,"sim:weight":0.404458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999554,"sim:weight":0.40262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930219,"sim:weight":0.401337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.4012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.394626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95821,"sim:weight":0.379325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447316,"sim:weight":0.369822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2684047,"sim:weight":0.3355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65423,"sim:weight":0.301145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13162,"sim:weight":0.297438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1683,"sim:weight":0.260039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5148,"sim:weight":0.242841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106378,"sim:weight":0.240719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Narratives of Loss and Guilt in a Selection of Plays by Tennessee Williams.","bibo:abstract":"Loss is a prominent theme in the works of American playwright Tennessee Williams (1911-1983). The four plays discussed in this study (The Glass Menagerie, A Streetcar Named Desire, Suddenly Last Summer and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) illuminate aspects of an ethics of loss which advocates the acceptance of the integrity of the lost object leading to a dynamic of mourning rather than to a melancholic incorporation of a \u0027part object\u0027 as a result of an inability to acknowledge the loss and one\u0027s guilt resulting from one\u0027s contribution to the loss of the loved object. Thus, each of the four plays discussed presents conflicting narratives, when one is aiming to become the dominant through silencing other potential narratives as an avoidant manner of rejecting one’s feelings of guilt for the loss one has experienced. Amanda, Stanley, Mrs. Venable and Brick all struggle against validating narratives of loss differing from their own. At the same time, the unacknowledged losses of those marginalised by society (in these plays- homosexuals and \u0027mental patients\u0027) are given voice in those plays (often by the main character or one of the main characters). Theories by Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein, Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok addressing loss and incorporation as a result of a failure of mourning provide the psychoanalytic background to the literary analysis of the plays.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tabak, Jennie"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109076,"sim:weight":0.199272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.187224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108282,"sim:weight":0.166556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.159248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.159167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.158244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734362,"sim:weight":0.157217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.148032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.145048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It represents a reflection on the practice of art therapy assessment in a service which provides a diagnosis of children who present with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, that is, with social impairments, communication disorders, developmental delays and behavioural problems.  \r\n\r\nAn investigation of art production in assessment and an interest in the institution’s discourses, are pursued through the construction of case reports.  Four subjects (children aged 4 years, 5 years 8 months, 7 years 7 months, and 11 years 5 months) are presented in three forms.  Firstly as “documentary subjects” through an analysis of the clinic’s documents.  Secondly as “ekphrastic subjects” – here the subjects are presented through a description and reproduction of the art work produced in the assessment, and thirdly as “discursive subjects”, presented through an analysis of speech and actions recorded on video.  Emphasis has been given to the discursive construction of subjectivity and the relation between subjects and art production.  \r\n\r\nThe documentary subjects illustrate a story showing that difference disrupts and families seek a restoration of union through engagement with professionals.  This story provides a frame which conditions the art therapy assessment and influences art production.  A social and cultural understanding of the art production in the clinic, an interpretation that does not discover signs of pathology in the art work, shows that the art work and its intentionality is jointly produced through negotiations between the child and the therapist.  The child is able to use art making to assess the situation and present a propositional self in an iconic form and art production also supports the generation of imaginary situations which enables the child to contest and explore power relations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tipple, Robin A."],"dc:date":"2011-05-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145181,"sim:weight":0.596367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630560,"sim:weight":0.542637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77678,"sim:weight":0.520824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77049,"sim:weight":0.488625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4152153,"sim:weight":0.47852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154483,"sim:weight":0.472384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108286,"sim:weight":0.470044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9033638,"sim:weight":0.460458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4153681,"sim:weight":0.455488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99827,"sim:weight":0.446442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97923,"sim:weight":0.445865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22884,"sim:weight":0.444518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.439977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160612,"sim:weight":0.436196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45939,"sim:weight":0.435965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4152562,"sim:weight":0.423802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78043,"sim:weight":0.423164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387078,"sim:weight":0.422879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77715,"sim:weight":0.422706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631825,"sim:weight":0.41952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Within these chapters and analyses, the terms sense and meaning are developed and defined in order to aide a discussion of the different aspects of poetic language in the context of writer/reader/text relations. \r\n\r\nThe thesis concludes that by examining the work of another poet and discussing various poetic aspects and techniques, one is able to articulate and demonstrate an understanding of poetry that might amount to an effective critical commentary, even in the absence of comment on one’s own poems directly. By arguing for new approaches towards how Creative Writers critically examine our own practices, this thesis also seeks to contribute to the development of a distinct criticism of practice in the field that is separate from criticism developed purely from a scholarly, readerly perspective.","bibo:AuthorList":["Underwood, Jack"],"dc:date":"2010-07-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108130,"sim:weight":0.716026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632002,"sim:weight":0.672232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734362,"sim:weight":0.648726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.596957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.587385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631953,"sim:weight":0.566038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109077,"sim:weight":0.565034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108661,"sim:weight":0.563038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.55187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.544913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.515323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.508864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632039,"sim:weight":0.491145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75372,"sim:weight":0.454281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176878,"sim:weight":0.435268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631941,"sim:weight":0.426291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827188,"sim:weight":0.274989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14054,"sim:weight":0.179748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9425735,"sim:weight":0.0960789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Most studies of this ‘third generation’ are framed in the terms of purely constructivist theories of collective (Halbwachs [1925] 1992) or communicative and cultural memory (Assmann 1999) and thus cannot take account of present but unrecognized aspects of the past. In contrast, this thesis draws on the traumatic realism of Dominick LaCapra and others to examine questions concerning the memory and representation of extreme events and makes use of the psychoanalytic notions of working-through and acting-out/mourning and melancholia. It does so to distinguish between what is remembered and what remains dissociated, marginalized and excluded in the grandchildren’s accounts of their Nazi family pasts. It furthermore draws on this non-binary distinction to acknowledge the two interrelated dimensions that remembering the National Socialist past entails in ‘the double “post” of the postmodern and the post-Holocaust’ (Santner 1990: 18): 1) coming to terms with the absence of essential, unfractured and stable identities, i.e. with what Eric Santner and Dominick LaCapra term structural trauma and 2) mourning the suffering caused by the Nazis and countless ordinary Germans, i.e. what both theorists refer to as historical trauma. This study explores how these two dimensions intersect in the generation of the grandchildren to find that the structural dimension has been receding into the background since German unification. This implies that the cultural and official memory of the Holocaust is increasingly either used for the purposes of national identity building, and thus in a redemptive way, or rejected because it is considered to obstruct a return to an essential and pure national identity. In drawing on recent theories of shame, this thesis argues that efforts of ‘coming to terms’ with the NS past can only be ‘successful’ if working-through structural trauma is part of the process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hohenlohe-Bartenstein, Alice"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6197509,"sim:weight":0.618703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":350,"sim:weight":0.59075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769023,"sim:weight":0.577687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197519,"sim:weight":0.569216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9535164,"sim:weight":0.559876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1060037,"sim:weight":0.559671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.553268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.544569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184937,"sim:weight":0.540625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75429,"sim:weight":0.538693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3137,"sim:weight":0.537585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13238,"sim:weight":0.53742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2262,"sim:weight":0.535165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2258,"sim:weight":0.533002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":740010,"sim:weight":0.530939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4757,"sim:weight":0.526527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109724,"sim:weight":0.524423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13181,"sim:weight":0.523032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9015018,"sim:weight":0.518654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5066273,"sim:weight":0.513635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is also about how theorising intuition can address the perception of urban space. In the course of formulating a theory of intuition, two case studies are looked at: the Gyeongbok Palace restoration and the Gamdong Public Art Project, the latter taking place in the former mining towns of Gohan and Sabuk. These two case studies provide pertinent cases for claiming that a theory of intuition can be explored within the context of space and time.  \r\n\r\nMy concern with reappraising intuition is motivated by analysing the differences between Korean and Western understanding of invisibility in relation to urban space. I explore invisibility through the dynamics between intensive causes and the material aspects of space. In a Korean context, invisibility indicates the ‘temporary absence of a thing’ or ‘potential visibility’ as inherent in the ‘real’. This notion of the real informs the methodology of this thesis, making me consider both internal and external aspects of urban space as parts of one indivisible mechanism. Throughout my research, an intercultural method is applied. I adapt a selective marginal European metaphysical theory of intuition to an East-Asian context, in order to formulate new concepts specific to the Korean situation. Thus, functional gi, spectres, intuitive visibility, intuitive tangibility and place-specificity are the key concepts by which I explore the constantly changing conditions of Korean modernity and the formation of urban space. Obtaining a clearer picture of urban development in South Korea through the use of these concepts reflects back on their role in the formulation of a theory of intuition. This research argues that intuition is not only an individual capacity, but also a phenomenon that is defined by objective, social and collective occurrences that affect the complex dynamics of contemporary urban space and time. \r\n\r\nMy research attempts to forge a connection between the intuitive and the political. The written part of the thesis explicates how the less visible and undervalued sides of Korean culture interact with political power to give rise to a new visibility from within that culture. My art practice tries to define the moment where a new sensibility takes form, while looking at less visible aspects of society and the spectacle of visibility in urban space as belonging to an inseparable process of becoming.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hong, Young-In"],"dc:date":"2011-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.567629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352169,"sim:weight":0.565033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43658,"sim:weight":0.563046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43930,"sim:weight":0.553049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43495,"sim:weight":0.544428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.534549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45754,"sim:weight":0.532967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.529836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.528235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.524567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46627,"sim:weight":0.524073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.512104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.502295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109076,"sim:weight":0.496723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.490405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.490405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710039,"sim:weight":0.488476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.488284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.483607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43801,"sim:weight":0.476771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Globalization, Communication and Economic Elites in South Korea","bibo:abstract":"Media and communications engage in social power relations. This thesis aims to investigate the “power value” of media and communications, focusing on the private communication practices of economic elites. The main argument is that, in the age of hyperglobalization, elite private communication plays no less important a part than mass forms of communication in shaping and maintaining economic elite power that operates in a far from transparent and accountable manner. This detachment of media and communications from the public is a symptom of the shrinking of democracy, which sanctions the massive transfer of resources to the organized interests. \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of empirical study, his thesis investigates the sites or networks of the national and transnational market forces within the historical context of the neo-liberalization of the Korean economy and society since the 1990s. The research shows, via in-depth interviews and qualitative case studies, how increasingly broader areas of the economy are becoming discursively de-politicized and how the closed communicative processes of economic elites are replacing democratic structures. Think-tanks, epistemic communities and policy networks, with their practices of private communication, lobbying and “brain sharing”, often make policy decisions that have a significant impact on the masses. The discrete culture and exclusive elite communication networks which are prevalent in the global-national investment web of intermediaries allow the growth of “invisible power”, which almost completely blocks the vigilance of the public. In the financial market, the cohesive culture, combined with the reflexive and intensive communication environment, generates a system of preferences and evaluations as well as one-sided expectations that have a tremendous impact on corporate management and the whole of society.\r\n\r\nThe study suggests that we should attend to the growing tendency of the mediation of power that is taking place with minimum reference to the public. This research contributes to the understanding of the “power value” of media and communications by providing an alternative or complementary explanation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, Bong-hyun"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.657616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48246,"sim:weight":0.64893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96170,"sim:weight":0.644869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43767,"sim:weight":0.639978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929828,"sim:weight":0.632755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187612,"sim:weight":0.627432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108256,"sim:weight":0.611965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106109,"sim:weight":0.609122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352124,"sim:weight":0.604144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":223840,"sim:weight":0.598338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5081868,"sim:weight":0.596573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93750,"sim:weight":0.595252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106049,"sim:weight":0.594655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48302,"sim:weight":0.586217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790543,"sim:weight":0.573433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48378,"sim:weight":0.570814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18124,"sim:weight":0.568549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788737,"sim:weight":0.568463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":545627,"sim:weight":0.567953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":853775,"sim:weight":0.56709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I propose that the most appropriate way to do this is by taking the whole cinematographic circuit into account – that is, the complete set of socio-technical operations that are involved in the medium, as remote as they might seem to be from actual cinematographic practices. I depart from the definition of circulation as a socio-technical continuum of the production, distribution, exhibition and evaluation of movies, explaining how these activities might be enacted in three different technological regimes: film, video and digital computation. Then, following an account of the early history of the pirate film society Cine Falcatrua (2003-2005), I show how the specificity of the medium is constituted and preserved throughout its technical progress. Acknowledging the limits of traditional film and screen studies to deal with these questions, I attempt to find an alternative research approach by engaging in practice-based investigation using curatorial strategies. By bringing together and analysing different film and art pieces in an exhibition entitled Denied Distances (2009), I propose a framework that allows an understanding of how media technology are defined in relation to one another, exposing how seemingly expanded practices such as installations and performances might be contained within conventional cinematographic apparatus. I conclude by suggesting that, in order to keep up with the ever-changing nature of the medium, the study of cinema would profit from engaging the extremes of scientific criticism and art practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gonring, Gabriel Menotti M.P"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.630129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709937,"sim:weight":0.627993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.53674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.522841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795073,"sim:weight":0.516947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1348897,"sim:weight":0.487673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":766475,"sim:weight":0.465833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.433369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.433369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778939,"sim:weight":0.426176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199387,"sim:weight":0.420579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103368,"sim:weight":0.413368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103335,"sim:weight":0.403925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1635102,"sim:weight":0.4011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":462978,"sim:weight":0.38999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13147,"sim:weight":0.380563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1663142,"sim:weight":0.375313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8779982,"sim:weight":0.372494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46658,"sim:weight":0.366222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103367,"sim:weight":0.351663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Some Notes on Performative Metricisation in the Contemporary Academy","bibo:abstract":"The performative co-construction of academic life through myriad metrics is now a global phenomenon as indicated by the plethora of university research or journal ranking systems and the publication of ‘league’ tables based on them. If these metrics are seen as actively constituting the social world, can an analysis of this ‘naturally occurring’ data reveal how these new technologies of value and measure are recursively defining the practices and subjects of university life?  Planning an RAE 2008 submission in Sociology required anticipation of how a panel of 16 peers would evaluate 39 institutions by weighted, relative worth of: aggregated data from 1,267 individuals who, between them cited a total of 3,729 ‘outputs’; the detailed narrative and statistical data on the research environment; and a narrative account of academic ‘esteem’. This data provided such institutional variables as postgraduate student numbers, sources of student funding, and research income from various sources.  To evaluate the ‘quality of outputs various measures of the ‘impact’ and/or ‘influence’ of journals, as developed from the Thomson-Reuters Journal Citation Reports, was linked to the data. An exploratory modeling exercise using these variables to predict RAE 2008 revealed that despite what we might like to think about the subtle nuances involved in peer review judgments, it turns out that a fairly astonishing 83% of the variance in outcomes can be predicted by some fairly simple ‘shadow metrics’: quality of journals in the submission, research income per capita and scale of research activity. We conclude that measuring the value of sociology involves multiple mutual constructions of reality within which ever more nuanced data assemblages are increasingly implicated and that analysis of this data can make explicit some of the parameters of enactment within which we operate in the contemporary academy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kelly, Aidan","Burrows, Roger"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.439975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17123,"sim:weight":0.439161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.423287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.422144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.422132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.389335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.389241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.387246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.387246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.370527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.366646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.365752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.365752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.365752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.365752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.365752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.365752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.365752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.365752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.365752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, we introduce works which demonstrate the role of perception in symbolic semantics, embed the representation of time in programming language, include visuospatial arrangement in syntax, and embed the activity of programming in the improvisation and experience of art.","bibo:AuthorList":["McLean, Christopher Alex"],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.631006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.606011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.592396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.588912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708251,"sim:weight":0.586904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447757,"sim:weight":0.584952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631582,"sim:weight":0.578571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.572048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182211,"sim:weight":0.564635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108179,"sim:weight":0.564556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57319,"sim:weight":0.555528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98629,"sim:weight":0.549142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.546856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.543135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58923,"sim:weight":0.541103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.53499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145594,"sim:weight":0.518685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91304,"sim:weight":0.51742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710683,"sim:weight":0.513253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108303,"sim:weight":0.508885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To date, there have been no systematic attempts to explore creativity in savant artists with ASD.\r\n\r\nMethods: Nine savant artists with ASD were compared with nine talented artists, nine non-artistically talented individuals with ASD, and nine individuals with moderate learning difficulties (MLD), on tasks in and out of their domain of expertise. This was to ascertain whether the performance of the savant artists was related to their artistic ability, their diagnosis of ASD or their level of intellectual functioning. \r\n\r\nResults: On a drawing task (the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking; Torrance, 1974), the responses of the art students were more creative (scoring higher on measures of fluency, originality, elaboration and flexibility) than the savant, ASD and MLD groups. However, the savants did produce more elaborative responses than the ASD and MLD groups. On a non-drawing construction task (figural synthesis; Finke \u0026 Slayton, 1988), the savants produced more original outputs than the ASD and MLD groups (scoring similarly to the art students). No group differences were found regarding fluency on this task.\r\n\r\nConclusions: On standardised creativity tasks, savant artists with ASD display high levels of elaboration (on drawing tasks) and originality (on non-drawing construction tasks), relative to groups with ASD or MLD. High elaboration and originality may result from a local processing bias, coupled with artistic talent, in this group.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pring, Linda","Ryder, Nicola","Crane, Laura","Hermelin, Beate"],"dc:date":"2012-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1446977,"sim:weight":0.694001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443558,"sim:weight":0.366748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445120,"sim:weight":0.34707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15398,"sim:weight":0.345869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85405,"sim:weight":0.344523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108575,"sim:weight":0.311112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443567,"sim:weight":0.298454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15399,"sim:weight":0.269011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70750,"sim:weight":0.253765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446981,"sim:weight":0.194351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445136,"sim:weight":0.193991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446973,"sim:weight":0.190704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443555,"sim:weight":0.17396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.173086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.156612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108668,"sim:weight":0.154854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445135,"sim:weight":0.146967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23814,"sim:weight":0.0751046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In order to identify the best methods to develop and sustain empathy in healthcare professionals there is a need for greater understanding of the antecedents and behaviours involved in empathic responding towards patients.\r\n\r\nThis thesis used a multidimensional model of empathy as a guide for research aimed at understanding the antecedents and behaviours involved in empathic interactions between patients and healthcare professionals. Studies one to three were cross sectional and quantitative in design. Studies one and two investigated relationships between self-reported empathy, personality and emotional intelligence. Findings suggested that (1) perspective taking and empathic concern were closely associated with agreeableness and extraversion, and also loaded on to the single factor of emotional intelligence (2) fantasy was associated with with openness to experience but not emotional intelligence, and (3) personal distress was positively related to neuroticism and negatively related to emotional intelligence. Study three went on to investigate the relationships between emotional intelligence, propensity to empathise and empathic behaviour amongst doctors. Propensity to empathise was positively related to observer ratings of empathic behaviour, but not when doctors had qualified in a different country. finally, study four qualitatively examined empathy in the healthcare context, from patients\u0027 perspectives. Situational and patient characteristics were also identified as antecedents to empathy, further relating to employee engagement and work design. The specific behaviours associated with empathy as judged by patients included helping and prosocial behaviours. Implications for the development of empathy are discussed in terms of possible training , development and work design interventions. Finally areas for future research are identified.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scott, Helen"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5849964,"sim:weight":0.668873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631699,"sim:weight":0.626477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":892202,"sim:weight":0.623476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22778,"sim:weight":0.528735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101573,"sim:weight":0.482253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.417236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26439,"sim:weight":0.417233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5725734,"sim:weight":0.410461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108868,"sim:weight":0.405857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.402854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.402311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.40191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387247,"sim:weight":0.390248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98884,"sim:weight":0.376427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.375112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.372974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225479,"sim:weight":0.368557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.366613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101445,"sim:weight":0.356405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43213,"sim:weight":0.352853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I define urban screens as image interfaces that occupy (material) public urban space and represent other (symbolic) space. I conceptualise encounters with urban screens as events of media consumption in which passers-by are invited to communicate, without the possibility of pressing control buttons. I draw on the perspective of phenomenological geography, which understands place as an experiential dimension of space, sustained through habit, and on media domestication studies, which analyse how people incorporate media technologies and texts in familiar spaces. My grounded qualitative research encompasses four different screen placements: street and underground advertising panels, an architectural interface in a promenade, and a public art installation. A triangulation of my observations, participants’ diaries and depth- interviews suggests that passers-by compensate for the lack of material controls by ‘taming’ the screens (learning about their position, size, scale and mode of address), and by making use of screens in responding to various elements of the site-specific situations of passing by (presence of others, traffic, weather). Passers-by develop what I call ‘situational uses of urban screens’, such as managing interaction with unknown others, escapism, gathering potentially useful information, and focussing thoughts. I understand these ethnomethodological appropriations of screens as forms of pedestrian tactical resistance to institutional spatial arrangements. In order to maintain their practices of looking around and moving through routines, passers-by make their uses of screens habitual, and develop knowledge of the varieties of urban screen technologies and images. Through such intimate negotiations of technologically mediated urban spaces, people domesticate urban screens as taken-for-granted elements of their everyday spaces and landscapes of media consumption. I conclude that passers-by experience the changes of technologies and images as spatial changes, which make their habituation of mediated cities laborious and require their domestication of urban screens to be continuous.","bibo:AuthorList":["Krajina, Zlatan"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.659139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930888,"sim:weight":0.599411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.578479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999527,"sim:weight":0.569994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.56052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929837,"sim:weight":0.553883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447568,"sim:weight":0.546682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108497,"sim:weight":0.546478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.544953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":433,"sim:weight":0.537392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734401,"sim:weight":0.524111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.521424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4408,"sim:weight":0.518535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69536,"sim:weight":0.518512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.518064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710128,"sim:weight":0.512791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17178,"sim:weight":0.510251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.509194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":328800,"sim:weight":0.506438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66571,"sim:weight":0.505642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Little has been investigated regarding the long term prognosis of these individuals with regards to the impact of the disorder in later life.  Also, previous investigations and resulting suggestions of underlying aetiology have been based on behavioural data of poor performance with few studies examining the underlying biological considerations. Thus, the research within this thesis had two key aims.  The first being to examine underlying processes associated with adaptive and goal directed movement in a sample of adults with DCD.  The second aim was to provide biological evidence for the continued difficulties of adults with DCD.   \r\n\r\nPrevious work in the area of cognitive psychology has identified distinct sensory and motor control functions as hallmarks of efficient and adaptive movement.  This thesis explores the underlying sensory and motor control abilities of adults with DCD.  There were two key aspects of this thesis with the first consisting of an investigation into the manner in which adults with DCD utilize sensory functions as a consequence of movement preparation.  The secondary portion of this thesis focused on two key aspects of response modulation, the ability to effectively activate cortical regions underpinning effector response and response inhibition.  Both aspects of the thesis drew methodological influences from the field of electroencephalography.  This approach provided direct biological measurement of both sensory and response related activity. \r\n\r\nThe data obtained within this thesis provides evidence that adults with DCD do in fact demonstrate both atypical behavioural and biological functions during manual response activity.  Chapter 4 highlighted key behavioural findings identifying that the DCD group demonstrates continued difficulty with accurate movement compared to typically developing peers.  Chapters 5 and 6 focused on sensory activity as a consequence of movement preparation.  The findings from these chapters suggest that adults with DCD present with maladaptive early sensory processing functions required for accurate movement output.  Findings from the later chapters investigating response related activity suggest that adults with DCD experience difficulty with both measures of response activation and inhibition.   \r\n\r\nIn summary, these findings suggest that adults with DCD experience an array of sensorimotor and response related difficulties vital to adaptive goal directed movement.  Importantly, the findings presented within this thesis are the first to present direct biological based evidence for continued difficulties in a sample of adults with DCD.  Conclusions are discussed in relation to previous research along with the possible influences these findings have in behaviour.  The limitations of the current research and suggestions for future work are also considered.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Duncan"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1445151,"sim:weight":0.740072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9045946,"sim:weight":0.631325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43982,"sim:weight":0.604144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43199,"sim:weight":0.558291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47317,"sim:weight":0.366955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998604,"sim:weight":0.361639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631989,"sim:weight":0.356519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707728,"sim:weight":0.354109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.351455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.324409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708254,"sim:weight":0.31973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.317809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020489,"sim:weight":0.314508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5622262,"sim:weight":0.31109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645776,"sim:weight":0.30307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7088,"sim:weight":0.29973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708102,"sim:weight":0.295725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99253,"sim:weight":0.292929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98776,"sim:weight":0.289582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69994,"sim:weight":0.28254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here we examined whether individuals with WS also have difficulties in visually controlling whole-body movements. We investigated visual control of stepping down at a change of level in children with WS (5–16-year-olds), who descended a single step while their movement was kinematically recorded. On each trial step height was set unpredictably, so that visual information was necessary to perceive the step depth and position the legs appropriately before landing. Kinematic measures established that children with WS did not use visual information to slow the leg at an appropriate point during the step. This pattern contrasts with that observed in typically developing 3- and 4-year-old children, implying severe impairment in whole-body visuomotor control in WS. For children with WS, performance was not significantly predicted by lowlevel visual or balance problems, but improved significantly with verbal age. The results suggest some plasticity and development in WS whole-body control. These data clearly show that visuospatial and visuomotor deficits in WS extend to the locomotor domain. Taken together with evidence for parietal and cerebellar abnormalities in WS, these results also provide new evidence for the role of these circuits in the visual control of whole-body movement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cowie, Dorothy","Braddick, Oliver J","Atkinson, Janette"],"dc:date":"2012-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1446975,"sim:weight":0.249702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446658,"sim:weight":0.236437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445151,"sim:weight":0.203476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109108,"sim:weight":0.185726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108842,"sim:weight":0.157089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85134,"sim:weight":0.155113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24880,"sim:weight":0.153768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69994,"sim:weight":0.143925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26079,"sim:weight":0.123521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445135,"sim:weight":0.121204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.114656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

So we made a short “guerilla” film of the bust of Nefertiti in the Neues Museum, Berlin – itself an artifact which the Egyptian Ministry for Antiquities are very keen to have returned. Beyond the idea that all “real” museums need to have some stolen goods on show is the fact that our theft, i.e. the “illegal” recording of an image against the orders of the institution, contravenes not the ownership of the object itself but the Neues Museum\u0027s ownership of that object\u0027s image (postcards are, of course, on sale in the shop).

Issues in real-time social research","bibo:abstract":"What makes scraping methodologically interesting for social and cultural research? This paper seeks to contribute to debates about digital social research by exploring how a ‘medium-specific’ technique for online data capture may be rendered analytically productive for social research. As a device that is currently being imported into social research, scraping has the capacity to re-structure social research, and this in at least two ways. Firstly, as a technique that is not native to social research, scraping risks to introduce ‘alien’ methodological assumptions into social research (such as an pre-occupation with freshness). Secondly, to scrape is to risk importing into our inquiry categories that are prevalent in the social practices enabled by the media: scraping makes available already formatted data for social research. Scraped data, and online social data more generally, tend to come with ‘external’ analytics already built-in. This circumstance is often approached as a ‘problem’ with online data capture, but we propose it may be turned into virtue, insofar as data formats that have currency in the areas under scrutiny may serve as a source of social data themselves. Scraping, we propose, makes it possible to render traffic between the object and process of social research analytically productive. It enables a form of  ‘real-time’ social research, in which the formats and life cycles of online data may lend structure to the analytic objects and findings of social research. By way of a conclusion, we demonstrate this point in an exercise of online issue profiling, and more particularly, by relying on Twitter to profile the issue of ‘austerity’. Here we distinguish between two forms of real-time research, those dedicated to monitoring live content (which terms are current?) and those concerned with analysing the liveliness of issues (which topics are happening?).","bibo:AuthorList":["Marres, Noortje","Weltevrede, Esther"],"dc:date":"2012-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2795040,"sim:weight":0.697216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.604067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.521869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.502944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.454798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.454798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.435284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.434588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176841,"sim:weight":0.386205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.38395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445178,"sim:weight":0.383376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.333741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89407,"sim:weight":0.31645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88939,"sim:weight":0.307603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312597,"sim:weight":0.183971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Located Lexicon project develops understanding about if, how and why geo-location is used to generate crowd-sourced descriptions of the places we inhabit.  Since the mass take up of smart geo-locative devices we see a new geo-presence of community emerging and we want to devise tools that enable learners to both produce and analyse this user derived data.  The idea for this project grew from envisioning an augmented view, like that from the top of a tall building, in which the describing words found in tags and tweets posted in that location could be plotted onto a visual map of that area.  This would enable large scale overviews of an urban environment to be annotated with personal, everyday, ‘off the cuff’ data.\r\n\r\nTo this end, our project involves making two applications that enables the urban environment to be described vividly and personally by its inhabitants at a more granular, local level.  The first uses infrastructural terms from the built environment to search-and-visualise large scale user generated content (UGC) and the second asks individual users to place a value on, and describe their location in response to a broadcasted query.  We wanted to find out what words emerged as being common or shared in describing place from UGC and how a lexicon of terms could enable the formation of Twitter-like groups that allow users to engage in finding out more about their location, especially by spotting what is not there in the datasphere.  Our focus is on building and using applications that ‘update and respond in real-time’ to UGC to learn more about the spatial, temporal and subjective nature of place.  For this project, we understand ‘place’ as a ‘constellation of processes rather than a thing’ and so our focus is on the objects, qualities and activities that continually mix and carry on in a geographically defined location that contribute to user-generated descriptions of place.  \r\n\r\nThis paper presents the details of our experiments conducted so far and the outcomes produced.  We start by describing the context to outline our thinking behind, and motivation for, the project.  This is followed by a series of initial experiments we have undertaken that have informed a working concept for the Located Lexicon application.  We conclude the paper by drawing together the main findings and reflections from the project.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sprake, Juliet","Rogers , Pete"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.843394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.839726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.838992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.829971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5162,"sim:weight":0.813322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.810744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.806442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.80505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.804112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151793,"sim:weight":0.802675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104855,"sim:weight":0.796483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.794897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.79394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.779847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.777069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193234,"sim:weight":0.775859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.773921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83543,"sim:weight":0.773814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2827,"sim:weight":0.758321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17178,"sim:weight":0.755023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Touring Exhibition.\r\n\r\nPhillip Allen and Dan Coombs have asked over 100 artists to make paintings of the nude. Many of the paintings will be unseen before the hang, and the artists hope the show will create a rich network of images that will establish a context for representation of the body in contemporary painting.\r\nIn recent decades the idea of the nude has been in decline in art‐school: life drawing is no longer practiced widely, ideas and research are currently preeminent. The tradition of teaching painting in British art schools has grown out of non‐referential painting, abstraction and formalism; and the objective, realist tradition of painting the figure died with Euan Uglow.\r\nWould it not be apposite then, to take a look at this neglected genre? The nude seems ripe for a reawakening; it is an implicitly psychological genre, tapping directly into the artistic psyche.\r\nThe show is an aesthetic experiment presenting a comprehensive range of responses to the subject. In part, Coombs and Allen’s interest lies in the idea of imposing a subject onto the participating artists, or taking away the normal responsibility the artist necessarily has for their subject. Or, giving to particular artists a subject they perhaps not normally deal with, as many of the participating artists are abstract painters.\r\nThe subject is vast and the nude is a fundamental subject for Western Art, or the art of any culture. The nude, along with the sublime landscape or the dramatic portrait, is one of the few truly universal subjects. In Coombs’ words, ‘the distinction between the naked and the nude is like the difference between the represented and the real. The nude body I take as the naked body in a state of representation. Either through being posed or painted, the nude is never fully naked ‐ the body has something projected on to it, it is made to stand for something. Through gesture, through deportment, through atmosphere, the nude is made to embody an idea, a feeling, a philosophy, a way of being’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coombs, Dan","Allen , Phillip"],"dc:date":"2012-01-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":2795040,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Other","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Re-distributing methods: digital social research as participatory research","bibo:abstract":"This paper contributes to debates about the implications of digital technology for social research by proposing the concept of the re-distribution of methods. Not only can this concept help to clarify these implications, it can inform our engagement with the normative and analytic promises and problems that the digitization of social life opens up for social research. I argue that in the context of digitization social research becomes noticeably a distributed accomplishment: online platforms, users, devices and informational practices actively contribute to the performance of social research. This also applies more specifically to social research methods: search engines, blogs, information visualisation tools, and so on, play a notable part in the enactment of methods on the Web. The paper explores this phenomenon in relation to online network and textual analysis, and argues that sociological research stands much to gain from engaging with it, both normatively and analytically speaking. I distinguish four predominant views on the re-distribution of digital social methods: methods-as-usual, big methods, virtual methods and digital methods. Taking up this last notion, I propose that a re-distributive understanding of social research opens up a new approach to the re-mediation of social methods in digital environments. I develop this argument through a discussion of  two particular online research platforms: the Issue Crawler, a web-based platform for hyperlink analysis, and the Co-Word Machine, an online tool of textual analysis currently under development. Both these tools re-mediate existing social methods, namely co-citation analysis and co-word analysis, and I argue that, as such, they involve the attempt to render specific methodology critiques effective in the online realm. Both methods were developed in the 1970s and 1980s as a critique of then dominant methods of citation analysis. Transposing these methods online, they offer a way for social research to intervene critically in digital social research, and more specifically, in re-distributions of social methods that are currently on-going in digital media.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marres, Noortje"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2794969,"sim:weight":0.697216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Housing not only provides essential shelter but also gives form to the social. It represents and embodies the materiality of civic politics and thus demonstrates the uneven nature of spatial justice at local and global scale. For many years artists have contributed to the design and organization of structures of living together, often with ambivalent effect. Whilst many have imagined – and attempted to implement – radical new forms of social housing, as alternatives to both privatization and state provision, they have also ushered in waves of gentrification, thus contributing significantly to a story of capitalization now dominant within urban infrastructures. \r\nSocial Housing–Housing the Social: Art, Property and Spatial Justice questions the politics of urban practice from a variety of geopolitical and disciplinary viewpoints, from liberal private initiatives to the Occupy movement, from Almere to Ramallah, mixing artistic and architectural contributions with those of sociologists, urban historians, philosophers, and activists.\r\nThe book is the second volume in the Actors, Agents and Attendants series of publications and symposia initiated by SKOR in partnership with Andrea Phillips to investigate the role of cultural practice in the organization of the public domain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Phillips, Andrea","Erdemci, Fulya"],"dc:date":"2012-06-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4187646,"sim:weight":0.538279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187817,"sim:weight":0.34752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.253186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.220406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.220406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109122,"sim:weight":0.20452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316484,"sim:weight":0.194234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312020,"sim:weight":0.191938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.187602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Interaction is primarily observed through the different use of software within architectural practice and in the construction of buildings, façades and systems. In turn, the kind of influences software has on architecture is one of the underlying questions of this thesis. \r\n\r\nFour qualities: Concept, Materiality, Digitization and Interactivity, are proposed as a theoretical base for the analysis and assessment of different aspects of computational architecture. These four qualities permeate and connect the diverse areas of research discussed, including architecture, cybernetics, computer science, interaction design and new media studies, which in combination provide the theoretical background. The modalities of computational architecture analysed here are, digital interior spaces, digitized design processes and communicational exterior environments. The analysis is conducted through case studies: The Fun Palace, Generator Project, Water Pavilion, Tower of Winds, Institute du Monde Arabe, The KPN building, Aegis Hyposurface, BIX Façade, Galleria Department Store, Dexia Tower, and also E:cue, Microstation, Auto-Cad, Rhino, Top Solid and GenerativeComponents software.\r\n\r\nThese are important for discussion because they present different architectural concepts and thoughts about interactivity within architecture. The analytical processes used in the research distinguished and refined, eight modes of interaction: (1) interaction as a participatory process; (2) cybernetic mutualism; (3) thematic interaction; (4) human-computer interaction during architectural design production; (5) interaction during digital fabrication; (6) parametric interaction; (7) kinetic interaction with dynamic architectural forms; and (8) interaction with façades. Out of these, cybernetic mutualism is the mode of interaction proposed by this thesis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Antic, Dragana Cebzan"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.642583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.621297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11127,"sim:weight":0.603729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447568,"sim:weight":0.602269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54103,"sim:weight":0.58123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447791,"sim:weight":0.576518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709937,"sim:weight":0.574742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313483,"sim:weight":0.56945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352169,"sim:weight":0.564907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929837,"sim:weight":0.556498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90240,"sim:weight":0.55486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447708,"sim:weight":0.552314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313555,"sim:weight":0.551221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":893920,"sim:weight":0.550838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.54729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.543891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.542584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707667,"sim:weight":0.531669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.530597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447850,"sim:weight":0.522841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Autoimmune disease marks this process as a painful, suicidal, and terrifying relation to one’s own body. Taking an autobiographical approach to autoimmune illness, this thesis examines the autoimmunity of the autos ‘itself’ in order to deconstruct a paradigm of immunity that paralyses one within process of self-destructive- defence. With Jacques Derrida’s appropriation of autoimmunity the term enters a deconstructive philosophical discourse. For Derrida, autoimmunity attacks not (only) the body but immune defences themselves and names the opening of the body to the future ‘to-come.’ And yet, the use of this term is couched in a rhetoric of terror that emphasises the threat of even worse events ‘to-come.’ This thesis explores whether the trauma of autoimmunity need necessarily emphasise an exponential threat that only refers to the worst. Or, whether this trauma might be ‘treated’ in a manner that affirms autoimmunity. Amongst the treatments employed are various narratives of science and science fiction. Chapter One explores the relations between biomedical and deconstructive autoimmunity and treats their traumatic symptoms psychoanalytically. Chapter Two employs the immunitary logic of systems theory to comfort my dis-ease, a dis-ease I share with the laboratory animal. While Chapter Three turns to the biopolitics of immunity and Roberto Esposito’s account of an affirmative biopolitics. However, while each of these ‘treatments’ attest to the possibility of opening the terror of the trauma to-come to the promise of better, they also repress, suppress, and ignore the possibility of a radical finitude, which, for Derrida, is essential for any ethical relation. Yet, if a radical finitude here takes on the character of the worst, it must be emphasised that it is an autoimmune finitude, for better or worse.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andrews, Alice"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.715133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145798,"sim:weight":0.693814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186292,"sim:weight":0.682339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":585310,"sim:weight":0.667791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46625,"sim:weight":0.632617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447898,"sim:weight":0.632595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382758,"sim:weight":0.623305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47303,"sim:weight":0.619951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86055,"sim:weight":0.617467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9322825,"sim:weight":0.614698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.587209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108705,"sim:weight":0.585467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445179,"sim:weight":0.565851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":631682,"sim:weight":0.552962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46226,"sim:weight":0.552788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":899625,"sim:weight":0.521683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":847,"sim:weight":0.515485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.512248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109209,"sim:weight":0.505527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447712,"sim:weight":0.4948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Previous research shows benefits for whole school environments, pupils who receive support, and pupil peer supporters, but is largely limited to Western case studies, which are often short-term and/or limited to qualitative data. This thesis addresses these issues through cross-national work on peer support use, and longitudinal case studies. \r\n\r\nPeer support use in Japan was investigated through a qualitative study. A range of approaches was seen and major themes identified, including the evolution of Japanese peer support, conflicts in approaches, and an emphasis upon community. A qualitative study in South Korea explored peer support and other anti-bullying initiatives, both proactive and reactive. Thematic analysis showed the importance of collectivist values, and a gap between policy and practice. Peer support was little used and, despite positive attitudes, barriers were perceived. A comparison of the UK, Japan and South Korea considered the impact of cultural values, education systems and the nature of bullying upon peer support use. \r\n\r\nTwo mixed methodology case studies of peer listening schemes in UK secondary schools were conducted, one over 18 months and another over six months. Both schemes had the general aim of providing additional pupil support, without focus on particular outcomes. Impact upon the domains typically benefited by peer support was evaluated; findings were broadly similar. Pupil awareness of the service was high, but in-depth knowledge was weaker and use was low. Attitudes were mixed, impact upon bullying and school climate was limited, but users and peer supporters perceived benefits. Both schemes evolved to include multiple approaches, and practical factors affecting development and effectiveness were identified. \r\n\r\nFinally, implications for peer support practice are drawn from the findings as a whole, and future research directions suggested.","bibo:AuthorList":["James, Alana"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101856,"sim:weight":0.816466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77943,"sim:weight":0.615326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309112,"sim:weight":0.607387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155365,"sim:weight":0.60695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187506,"sim:weight":0.581257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156053,"sim:weight":0.561109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4150618,"sim:weight":0.539465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999528,"sim:weight":0.537974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77678,"sim:weight":0.515058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447819,"sim:weight":0.508313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313642,"sim:weight":0.495139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101238,"sim:weight":0.494896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45450,"sim:weight":0.491879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5066765,"sim:weight":0.491354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.484531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447706,"sim:weight":0.47909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4153043,"sim:weight":0.475331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9028441,"sim:weight":0.470769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":741557,"sim:weight":0.447787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393398,"sim:weight":0.444097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

FLOSSTV (Free, Libre, Open Source Software TV) covers a broad range of practices, from television via documentary up to media arts productions. This thesis documents the endeavour to formulate a policy for FLOSS culture. FLOSSTV studies the impact of new intellectual property legislation on media production, as well as conceptions and applications of collective authorship and alternative licensing schemes.\r\n\r\nFLOSSTV sets out to explore methods that can facilitate media and arts practitioners wishing to engage in collaborative media productions. The thesis sets out to investigate the theories and histories of collaborative media and arts productions in order to set the ground for an exploration of the tools, technologies and aesthetics of such collaborations. The FLOSSTV thesis proposes a set of contracts and policies that allow for such collaborations to develop. It is through practice that this research explores FLOSS culture, including its methods, licensing schemes and technologies. In order to focus the research within the field of FLOSSTV I initiated the practice ­based Deptford.TV pilot project as the central research experiment for the FLOSSTV thesis. DVD ONE contains a series of films produced collaboratively for Deptford.TV that express the characteristics and contractual arrangements of FLOSS culture.\r\n\r\nDeptford.TV is an online audiovisual database primarily collecting media assets around the Deptford area, in South­East London, UK. Deptford.TV functions as an open, collaborative platform that allows artists, film­makers, researchers and participants of the local workshops in and around Deptford, and also beyond Deptford, to store, share, re­edit and redistribute their footage and projects. The open and collaborative nature of the Deptford.TV project demonstrates a form of shared media practice in two ways: audiences become producers by submitting their own footage, and the database enables the contributors to interact with each other. Through my practice­lead research project Deptford.TV I argue that, by supporting collaborative methods and practices, FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open Source Software) can empower media and arts practitioners to collaborate in production and distribution processes of media and arts practices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hadziselimovic, Adnan"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.618211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.604364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.57608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89658,"sim:weight":0.573473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.570457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.56967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.564387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929837,"sim:weight":0.561892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187495,"sim:weight":0.557164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151791,"sim:weight":0.54865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.54274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26473,"sim:weight":0.531723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151793,"sim:weight":0.530159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187752,"sim:weight":0.527994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2750488,"sim:weight":0.52685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.52527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709937,"sim:weight":0.522439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2800280,"sim:weight":0.519055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447850,"sim:weight":0.516947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447601,"sim:weight":0.514126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The international art movement New Tendencies (NT) (1961-1973) provides the material evidence through its exhibitions, symposia, artworks, catalogues, newsletters and artist\u0027s statements. The basic methodological assumption behind my research is that new insights are gained by questioning the various interdependencies between NT and historical change. \r\n\r\nNT was searching for a synthesis between socialist emancipation and artistic modernism by proposing to replace the notion of art with visual research. The project emerged in Zagreb, capital of Croatia which was then part of Yugoslavia, a Socialist nation which did not belong to the Eastern bloc and experimented with market Socialism combined with social self-management and self-government. Yugoslavia\u0027s unique role between the hegemonic power blocs  made it possible that an international, humanistic, and progressive art movement could emerge from its territory.  \r\n\r\nWith every exhibition and conference NT articulated its artistic position and set itself  into relation with the respective techno-economic paradigm. NT began during the height of Fordism, continued during Fordism\u0027s moment of crisis in 1968, and ended when a new paradigm – informational capitalism – started to develop from within the old one. In this historical context, my hypothesis is that NT\u0027s exploration of participatory art stands in direct relation to the rise of automation and cybernation in society. A further layer of inquiry is the historically changing relationship between manual and intellectual labour and how art addresses it. \r\n\r\nBy contextualising NT my research contributes a new dimension to the history of media art. Through the chosen methodology, a new understanding is gained not only of this important art movement but of the general dynamics of media art in the second half of the 20th century.","bibo:AuthorList":["Medosch, Armin"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.301593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.221423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.204843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.204843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.202138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.193031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It gives substance to a moral involvement in contemporary art that is operationally central to the distinction between its primary and secondary markets. In so doing, critique serves to maintain the grip of the primary market over contemporary art. Accounting for the distinction between markets in terms of a ‘spirit of capitalism’ shows furthermore how, even though the primary market disparages the encroachment of neo-liberal marketization in its field of activity, in its reliance on critique it nonetheless serves to legitimize the social re-organization\r\nof capital accumulation by neo-liberalism. Critique is then identified as an alibi for marketization qua neoliberal capital accumulation. On this basis, the heightened cultural and market interests in contemporary art at precisely the moment when neo-liberalism has been a dominant economic model have to be understood as something other than just an effect of inflated asset prices and cheap credit.","bibo:AuthorList":["Malik, Suhail"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.243841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71879,"sim:weight":0.232625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631458,"sim:weight":0.228605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71882,"sim:weight":0.218234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.215667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.198692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77455,"sim:weight":0.170231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.166099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.166099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.15878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.132865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

If found safe and effective—a difficult criteria to establish, a point that is central to this paper—PrEP has the potential to significantly alter HIV prevention, well ahead of a vaccine or topical microbicide. Hence, despite uncertainty about PrEP’s viability, the potential significance of its impact on the HIV field requires early planning. In order to address this potentiality, we use a methodological approach drawn from the sociology of expectations to examine interviews with US-based scientific stakeholders in the trialing of PrEP. We identify how PrEP is anticipated as both stable object and process involving multiple contingencies. These divergent conceptions enable us to illuminate a range of social, cultural, ethical, pharmaceutical and medical possibilities understood to potentially arise with PrEP. Further, they lead us to propose that the multiple contingencies that enact PrEP as an emergent entity offer scope for rethinking PrEP and, more broadly, the challenges of HIV prevention.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rosengarten, Marsha","Michael, Mike"],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.25723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795344,"sim:weight":0.168075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The majority of experimental studies investigating this association have relied heavily on the cold pressor technique as a means of pain induction, limiting the generalisability of results. The aim of the current study was to extend previous research by using two types of pain stimuli (cold and heat) to determine whether the link between anxiety sensitivity and pain generalises beyond cold pressor pain. The pain experience of 125 participants in response to these stimuli was assessed using threshold and tolerance readings, as well as subjective pain ratings. Results indicated a positive association between anxiety sensitivity and subjective pain, with this association observed primarily in females. Although analysis also indicated a basic generalisability of results across pain stimuli, anxiety sensitivity effects appeared to be especially pronounced during heat stimulation.  These findings suggest that those high in anxiety sensitivity may respond more negatively to specific types of pain. Possible implications along with suggestions for future research are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thompson, Trevor","Keogh, Edmund","French, Christopher C.","Davis, Robert"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5849490,"sim:weight":0.630892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653783,"sim:weight":0.619262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631593,"sim:weight":0.558638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145917,"sim:weight":0.553104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929892,"sim:weight":0.511163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75375,"sim:weight":0.495603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77097,"sim:weight":0.464666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107889,"sim:weight":0.447503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75101,"sim:weight":0.444581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74657,"sim:weight":0.425266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1118015,"sim:weight":0.353751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182563,"sim:weight":0.348111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75632,"sim:weight":0.331353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780336,"sim:weight":0.316339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.27742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731301,"sim:weight":0.200464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761126,"sim:weight":0.159026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103085,"sim:weight":0.157828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.148433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222627,"sim:weight":0.145744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This cultivates mutually beneficial ‘synergies’ to avoid the parsimonious image of some ‘sustainability’ discourse. Synergy naturally pervades across all levels, including the interactions within collaboration. Our research has shown that, in order to achieve a high level of creative synergy within teams of specialist designers, it is important to select members who represent a sufficient diversity of cognitive styles, linguistic structures, knowledge bases, viewpoints and experiences (cf. Belbin, 1993). This is because ‘difference’ is the fundamental basis from which new ideas are generated, bisociatively. But because heterogeneous teams are highly complex and emergent they are extremely volatile and sensitive, and thus are averse to hierarchical, top-down modes of management. Ideal creative teams would probably conform to Arthur Koestler’s (1967) definition of ‘holarchy’, in which a given ‘whole’ is governed by its parts. The paper outlines some mathematical tools that were designed to encourage, map or sustain (albeit on a temporary basis) what we call ‘network consciousness’, which seems important for creating holarchic teams.","bibo:AuthorList":["Backwell, John L.","Wood, John"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.21429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.207688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446276,"sim:weight":0.187202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.167534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It notes that contemporary art has largely forgotten the fertility of art\u0027s suture to mathematics, perhaps as a result of broad currents romanticism and twentieth-century philosophy that denigrated mathematical thinking. The paper traces out two major epochs that characterize the relation between art and number: the first being what the paper terms the epoch of ratio, (where number is sutured to image by means of a semiotics of geometrical proportions); and the second being the epoch of the list, (where visible constructs attempt to articulate number as contingency and as infinity). Conceptual art since 1963, continuing with post-conceptual art today, is shown to be fundamentally motivated by the problem of visualizing (or visually implying) the infinite - a problem not unlike that contained in Kant\u0027s \u0027Analytic of the Sublime\u0027 in the \u0027Critique of Judgement\u0027. The paper then turns to set theory as deployed in Alain Badiou\u0027s philosophy. It is argued that set theory offers the most plausible reading of conceptual art\u0027s relation to mathematics; yet whatever was vital in the conceptual art of the 1960s lacks traction today; this lack can be usefully approached via Badiou\u0027s formal proof of the excess contained but not indicated within any set. Finally, some recent artworks (including works by Bernd and Hilla Becher, Florian Slotawa and others) are considered as fruitful attempts to perform the excess the set.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chilver, John"],"dc:date":"2012-02-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.292924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443361,"sim:weight":0.263532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86312,"sim:weight":0.243847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.233248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.205084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108655,"sim:weight":0.196616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85264,"sim:weight":0.185121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447667,"sim:weight":0.184892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108757,"sim:weight":0.166985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Presented as a seamless monologue, she acts out their political attitudes, bridging the gap in time, subjecting them to scrutiny in terms of their message and effect. The monologue is serially interrupted through the performers constant pushing and shifting of the life-size ‘Zulu’ letters into multiple configurations. Each performance of the work is recorded onto analogue audio-tape, the reel-to-reel player is part of the installation for the duration of the exhibition. This residue of the performance - reminiscent of the communiqués these groups would have produced at the time - becomes an intimate one-on-one experience as the audience’s only access to the recordings is through headphones.\r\n\r\nZULU (SPEAKING IN RADICAL TONGUES) was exhibited in the international group exhibition ‘Here We Dance’ at Tate Modern in 2008 with production funding from Tate. ‘Here We Dance’ looks at the relationship between the body and the state, exploring how the physical presence and circulation of bodies in public space informs our perceptions of identity, nation, society and democracy. The title derives from a work by Ian Hamilton Finlay, which refers to the celebrations that took place during the French Revolution, and alludes to the importance of social gathering in any form of political action or resistance. Bodily movements and gestures, collective actions and games are examined through media as diverse as film, photography, neon text and performance. Each work presents the viewer with the residue of a past event, be it personal memory, cultural tradition, or a moment of historical or political significance.

This article explores some of the aesthetic, political and conceptual issues that arise when we pose the problem of representing social totality today. It  revisits two influential assertions of theory’s calling to generate orienting and totalising representations of capitalist society: C. Wright Mills’s plea for the \u0027sociological imagination\u0027 and Fredric Jameson appeal for an ‘aesthetic of cognitive mapping\u0027. Mills and Jameson converge on the need to mediate personal experience with systemic constraints, knowledge with action, while underscoring the political urgency and epistemic difficulty of such a demand. The article contrasts these perspectives with the repudiation of a sociology of totality in the actor-network theory of Bruno Latour. It explores this contrast through the \u0027panorama\u0027 as a visual practice and a metaphor for theory itself. Against Latour’s proposal to reduce and relativise totality, it argues that sociology can learn from contemporary artistic efforts to map social and economic power as a whole. ‘Panoramic’ projects in the arts, such as Allan Sekula’s and Mark Lombardi’s, can allow us to reflect sociology’s own deficit of imagination, and on the persistence of the desire to ‘see it whole’ – especially when that whole is opaque, fragmented, contradictory. A live sociology can only gain from greater attention to the critical experiments with forms and methods of representation that are being carried out by artists preoccupied with the staging of social totality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Toscano, Alberto"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.277053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.269583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445655,"sim:weight":0.244389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.213444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.211221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.198448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.196805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.192844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although this conflictual dimension has been amply documented, little critical attention has been paid to how nomenclature and classification inform the conflictual dynamic and are informed by it in turn. In this paper I engage with this question by focusing on debates around the medical terminology in use, and on the alternative terminology developed by social scientists. I argue that, in different ways, medical and social scientific discourse collude in a performative disavowal of the psychological dimension of ‘MUS’. I then discuss the paradoxical character of this disavowal and suggest that it tends to perpetuate polemical modes of engagement around ‘MUS’. I conclude with suggestions on how critical research might counteract this tendency.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greco, Monica"],"dc:date":"2012-05-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The concept of affectivity at play in this ‘turn’ remains, however, somewhat vague and slippery. Starting with Silvan Tomkins’ influential theory of affect, this paper will explore the relevance of the general assumptions (or ‘utmost abstractions’) that inform thinking about affectivity. The technological and instrumentalist character of Tomkins’ basic assumption will be traced through four socio-historical-technological configurations in the context of which thinking about affectivity is shaped. The political relevance of this instrumentalist utmost abstraction concerning affectivity is articulated by reference to Hobbes’ development of political science. In this way, through a critique of the instrumentalism informing Tomkins’ mode of thought, a way is opened for a revised general assumption concerning affectivity, based on process thinking.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stenner, Paul","Greco, Monica"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It asks whether materials and methods are ‘sociological’ to the extent that they tell about the problems of society, or whether it is the unique relation of sociology to its materials and methods that defines sociological practice. Exploring these questions in relation to a project that was researched and written during an extended period of unpaid leave (i.e. outside the profession and the institution), the article also examines some of the consequences of a changed relation between sociology and experience.

As Sociologists we are especially well-placed to address certain assumptions on which these inter-disciplinary approaches rely.  I argue that assumptions about the relationship between social movements and human rights that are fundamentally normative limit our understanding of the diversity of organisational forms through which human rights are being defined, and of the complexity of multi-scalar law through which claims to justice are being made.  In particular, the importance of the state and national law for institutionalising human rights norms should not be neglected by privileging either local or international law as the legitimate focus of democratic claims for justice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nash, Kate"],"dc:date":"2012-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This article looks in three steps at how sociology and Science and Technology Studies (STS) have historically framed the world as laboratory. First, in early sociology, the laboratory was an important metaphor to conceive of sociology as a scientific enterprise. In the 1950s, the trend reversed and with the emergence of a ‘qualitative sociology’, sociology was seen in opposition to laboratory work. With the ascent of laboratory studies, the laboratory perspective was again applied to many fields, including sociology itself. Based on a definition of a laboratory as aiming at placeless knowledge and being inconsequential this article argues that the two waves of laboratorization were metaphorical and did not really turn the world into a laboratory. Instead, two alternative concepts, those of the unilatory and the locatory, are proposed to gain a more precise understanding of some of these metaphorical uses of the term ‘laboratory’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guggenheim, Michael"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.241781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.232526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67989,"sim:weight":0.20933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108027,"sim:weight":0.156243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.152513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108327,"sim:weight":0.142147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The article is based on insights from actor-network theory and analyzes buildings as quasi-technologies. It draws on two case studies in Switzerland. The first looks at the introduction of flat roofs along with modern architecture in the 1920s that led to the introduction of building codes in Ascona. The second is contemporary: it looks at the disputes about the right of Muslims to add minarets to prayer spaces that eventually led to an initiative to ban minarets altogether. In each of the cases I show how the building code mediates the travelling element and the associated lifestyle of the implicated groups and leads to a new definition of what those building types are. The law emerges as an important mediator of building types because it constantly shifts building types as being defined as material or social.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guggenheim, Michael"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.225437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60658,"sim:weight":0.22174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447673,"sim:weight":0.201736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.171623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446416,"sim:weight":0.156219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.148725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108193,"sim:weight":0.128429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Viewing these works in conjunction with Palaeolithic hand stencils, the marking of threshold events emerges as a theme. Resonant material is then assembled and studied: Surrealist texts and photography, or the use of photography, by André Breton, Claude Cahun and Man Ray; the medical theses of psychiatrists François Tosquelles and Jean Oury; and works on prehistoric art by Georges Bataille and André Leroi-Gourhan. The marking of threshold events at two nesting scales of analysis – the evolutionary emergence of the human species; and the psychotic onset of hallucination and delusion – is examined. Echoes are found to resound in a third register– in the neurological events that give rise to consciousness and dream experience. Consideration of the Johns drawing and Nauman photograph in these terms is proposed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Steeds, Lucy"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Whilst memories of 9/11 have taken disparate forms and served divergent agendas  since 2001, I contend that certain narrative frameworks can be seen to mediate the  representation  of  the  attacks  across  discursive  spheres.  Such  paradigms  prescribe  particular  interpretations  of  September  11,  threatening  to  reify  its  memory  with  problematic, and often political, implications. I trace these models to their historical  origins,  interrogating  the  means  by  which  representational  forms  acquire  hegemonic  weighting  from  their  repetition  over  time.  I  critique  the  processes  through  which  memory’s  centrifugal  dynamism  is  made  to  appear  as  centripetal  stasis.  In  so  doing,  I  turn  my  attention  to  the  current  theorising  of  memory.  Whilst  the  most  important  developments  in  memory  studies  in  recent  years  have  identified  democratising  modes  of  remembrance  that  seek  to  transcend  national  and cultural boundaries, I suggest that, as it is currently practiced, commemoration  remains an unfortunately competitive enterprise. I point to the dangers of allowing  an  idealistic  –  and  at  times,  unreflexive  –  approach  to  theory  to  deflect  attention  from the more problematic aspects of memory in practice.    Ultimately, I hope to destabilize these dynamics, opening the way for a more ethical  reconfiguration of the relationships between the public and the private, the self and  the  other,  the  local,  national,  and  the  global,  in  American  memorial  culture.  I  emphasize  the  need  to  remain  attentive  to  the  mutually  constitutive  relationship  between  commemorative  practice  and  theory,  as  well  as  the  broader  negotiations  that  take  place  between  memory  and  history.  I  draw  attention  to  the  counter-­‐ narratives that have been lost in the standardizing discourses that have surrounded  9/11,  calling  for  the  development  of  an  inclusive  culture  of  memory,  tolerant  of  diversity and attentive to difference, both inside and outside national boundaries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bond, Lucy"],"dc:date":"2012-02-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447847,"sim:weight":0.311359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340689,"sim:weight":0.292381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.275977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.261438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.24885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.237138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.213876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.212135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study investigates for the first time the psychodynamics of the gaze in the triangular relationship between congenitally blind clients, their artwork, and their sighted art psychotherapist. Analysing case material from a cohort of four blind clients in long-term art psychotherapy, this research explores how blindness and sight engender gazes that are specific to the sensory differences between the clients and the therapist. The nature of the interpersonal gazes between blind client and sighted art therapist are investigated in terms of transference, power and surveillance. The research shows that the client’s ‘blind gaze’ and the therapist’s ‘sighted gaze’ are subject to unconscious dynamics that mirror the continued historic, cultural and psychological misunderstandings between the blind and the sighted and powerfully determine the individual therapeutic situation. Through a multimodal qualitative research design, including the in-depth visual analysis of the clients’ artwork, three types of images are discerned by their characteristic form and content; these are described as protomorphous, allomorphous and automorphous sculptures. It is argued that the reciprocal relationship between these three forms of imagery and the clients engenders distinct gazes which gradually enhance the clients’ ability for the conscious reflection of ‘other’ in relation to ‘self’, arriving at a dynamic, changed and loveable self-image towards the end of therapy. The investigation further explores how the clients’ and the therapist’s joint beholder’s gaze likewise evolves in relation to the three forms of artwork and to the gaze of the artwork back to its maker and the therapist. The main findings of the study are described as a congruent and progressive anamorphosis of artwork and gazes; it is suggested that these specific forms of artwork and gazes do not only challenge the sighted therapist’s visual paradigm, but also eventually engender a changed sensory culture that reconciles the perceptual divide between blind client and sighted art therapist. This shared culture is discussed in terms of a tactile joint attention and a ‘tactile gaze’. The case material and the findings are examined and reflected against diverse theories on the gaze with particular reference to psychoanalysis and art psychotherapy. The entire process of the study, its methodologies and its impact on current practice are discussed and evaluated, and potential areas of further research are outlined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Herrmann, U.K"],"dc:date":"2012-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999545,"sim:weight":0.361682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108240,"sim:weight":0.267599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108524,"sim:weight":0.216242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.197518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.197223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108891,"sim:weight":0.183613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.175119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108868,"sim:weight":0.168808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.163841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56680,"sim:weight":0.162787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although medical infrastructure of even the most basic type is tragically lacking and in some areas shockingly absent in the OPT, it is the particular way in which medicine comes to be needed that we focus on. Leaving aside the rhetoric that has claimed authority over what can or cannot be said of the Occupation, we focus on its geo-technological arrangements. By placing photos and case studies of medical obstruction within an analysis of the Occupation, we forge an encounter between reader and the Occupation to raise questions about the use of medicine in this context and the manner in which conventional ethics can give legitimacy to this use. On the basis of what we show through visual and textual documentary material, we propose ethics be understood as inherent to the geo-technological arrangements that make life possible or, as in this case, undermine, obstruct or deliberately take life. Hence the ethical obligation that Butler calls upon is reiterated in ways that encompass the everyday features of Occupation including those active in the emergence of medicine as a tactic of war.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rosengarten, Marsha","Pfingst, A"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85453,"sim:weight":0.329396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1649312,"sim:weight":0.286032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930622,"sim:weight":0.258919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108852,"sim:weight":0.250804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.249371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780590,"sim:weight":0.24683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443364,"sim:weight":0.241975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108703,"sim:weight":0.230226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.21176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447847,"sim:weight":0.211758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.203126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The volume is divided into four main parts:\r\n\r\n    * universals and particulars of affect\r\n    * embodying affect\r\n    * political economies of affect\r\n    * affect, power and justice. \r\n\r\nEach main part comprises three sections dedicated to substantive themes, including emotions, history and civilization; emotions and culture; emotions selfhood and identity; emotions and the media; emotions and politics; emotions, space and place, with a final section dedicated to themes of compassion, hate and terror. Each of the twelve sections begins with an editorial introduction that contextualizes the readings and highlights points of comparison across the volume. Cross-national in content, the collection provides an introduction to the key debates, concepts and modes of approach that have been developed by social scientist for the study of emotion and affective life.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greco, Monica","Stenner, Paul"],"dc:date":"2008-12-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We provide a brief review some of the recent discussions on how to conceive of medicine and its bodies, noting the increasing attention now given to medicine as a technology or series of technologies active in constituting a multiplicity of entities—bodies, diseases, experimental objects, the individualization of responsibility for health and even the precarity of life. We contrast what feminist theorists in the tradition of Judith Butler have referred to as the question of matter, and Science and Technology Studies with its focus on practice and the nature of emergence. As such we address tensions that exists in analyses of the ontological status of ‘the body’—human and non-human— as it is enacted in the work of the laboratory, the randomized controlled trial, public health policy and, indeed, the market that is so frequently entangled with these spaces. So, in keeping with the recent turns toward ontology and affect, we suggest that we can regard medicine as concerned with the contraction and re-configuration of the body’s capacities to affect and be affected, in order to allow for the subsequent proliferation of affects that, according to Bruno Latour, marks corporeal life. Treating both contraction and proliferation circumspectly, we focus on the patterns of affects wrought in particular by the abstractions of medicine that are described in the contributions to this special issue. Drawing on the work of A.N. Whitehead, we note how abstractions such as ‘medical evidence’, the ‘healthy human body’, or the ‘animal model’ are at once realized and undercut, mediated and resisted through the situated practices that eventuate medicine’s bodies.   Along the way, we touch on the implications of this sort of perspective for addressing the distribution of agency and formulations of the ethical and the political in the medical eventuations of bodies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Michael, Mike","Rosengarten, Marsha"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85453,"sim:weight":0.351888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.331196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445655,"sim:weight":0.322488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447503,"sim:weight":0.297121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.276796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.267328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.262577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.233594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Bivariate relationships were assessed with c2 or Fisher’s exact test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess independent relationships with primary outcome variables.\r\n\r\nResults:  Responses from 1161 HIV-negative and untested men were analysed. Prior use of antiretroviral drugs as PrEP was rare (n¼6). Just over a quarter of the sample (n¼327; 28.2%) was classified as willing to use PrEP. Willingness to use PrEP was independently associated with younger age, having anal intercourse with casual partners (protected or unprotected), having fewer concerns about PrEP and perceiving oneself to be at risk of HIV. Among men who were willing to use PrEP (n¼327), only 26 men (8.0%) indicated that they would be less likely to use condoms if using PrEP. The likelihood of decreased condom use was independently associated with older age, unprotected anal intercourse with casual partners (UAIC) and perceiving oneself to be at increased risk of HIV.\r\n\r\nConclusions: The Australian gay and bisexual men the authors surveyed were cautiously optimistic about PrEP. The minority of men who expressed willingness to use PrEP appear to be appropriate candidates, given that they are likely to report UAIC and to perceive themselves to be at risk of HIV.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holt, Martin","Murphy, Dean, A","Callander, Denton","Ellard, Jeanne","Rosengarten, Marsha","Kippax, Susan","de Wit, John"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Drawing on Latour’s and Whitehead’s concept of proposition, and Serres’ call for a philosophy of prepositions, we use the composite notion of pre/propostitons to trace the shifting topological status of HIV. For example, we show how PrEP emerges through topological entwinements of globalizing biomedical standardization, localizing protests against PrEP trials and globalizing ethical principles. We go on to examine how our own analysis manifests a parallel topological pattern in which we deploy a globalizing argument about the localizing of the globalizing found in the AIDS clock and the PrEP trails.  Finally, we consider how the movement of ‘topology’ into the social sciences might itself benefit from a topological treatment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Michael, Mike","Rosengarten, Marsha"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

An experimental protocol first used with human infants was adapted to investigate empathy in domestic dogs. Dogs oriented toward their owner or a stranger more often when the person was pretending to cry than when they were talking or humming. Observers, unaware of experimental hypotheses and the condition under which dogs were responding, more often categorized dogs’ approaches as submissive as opposed to alert, playful or calm during the crying condition. When the stranger pretended to cry, rather than approaching their usual source of comfort, their owner, dogs sniffed, nuzzled and licked the stranger instead. The dogs’ pattern of response was behaviorally consistent with an expression of empathic concern, but is most parsimoniously interpreted as emotional contagion coupled with a previous learning history in which they have been rewarded for approaching distressed human companions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Custance, Deborah M.","Mayer, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2012-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":22778,"sim:weight":0.202504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87334,"sim:weight":0.155486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930478,"sim:weight":0.138979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.126881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85183,"sim:weight":0.124801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.124057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108963,"sim:weight":0.12033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654995,"sim:weight":0.11742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108900,"sim:weight":0.11103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176863,"sim:weight":0.105806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85323,"sim:weight":0.0897359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84947,"sim:weight":0.071094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Climatic, economic and social instability dominate our local and international political discourse. It feels almost impossible as a young independent designer to be able to make a beautiful and meaningful contribution to a better world and make a profit! So how can designers use their ‘possibility seeking’ capabilities to rebalance and reinvent our battered relationship with the environment, alienated social habits and defunct economic and political policies? How can we achieve all this whilst being rewarded for our work creatively and financially? Since 1995, MA Design Futures at Goldsmiths, University of London has advocated an extended role for design as an agent for ecological, social and economic change. In 2012, industry and government are now finally catching up, with countries such as the UK and Korea beginning to explicitly value a role for design thinking and practice as a driver for business and social innovation. \r\n\r\nOne of our aims on MA Design Futures is to train our students to evolve design tools and processes for working in teams. Our students graduate from the course to work not only in the creative industries but also as socially and environmentally aware designers in the public sector and design strategists in business. This is because through their experience on the course they become artful negotiators and synergisers who can mediate in between the different professional disciplines. For example, this year, one of our graduates is establishing a design innovation consultancy in the field of bio-synthetics in Columbia. Another has set up their own MA in ‘Creative Leadership’ at a top business school in London. What do these two very diverse designers have in common? They have both used Design Futures to inform the design of a reflexive theoretical and practical framework for action.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Hannah"],"dc:date":"2012-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These social valuations are however themselves no less contingent since they are only the instantiation of a set of interests circulating at any given moment, shaped entirely by the fortunes of their own formation. Though the contingency of art’s indefinition is distinct from the contingency of social fact, art’s contingency in principle requires its over-determination by the social contingencies of its valuations, which is its primary and only determination, how it is preserved as art. Art is then its (e)valuation, a demand for interests to find sense for its indefinition - not least the sense that it is in fact art. It is then the invitation to demonstrate power, and is in fact always and only a manifestation of power. Specifically, it is the operation of a conventionalism.","bibo:AuthorList":["malik, suhail","el-Baroni, Bassam","Beaudry, Jeremy","Haq, Nav"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.322766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108286,"sim:weight":0.232904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69397,"sim:weight":0.224511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108318,"sim:weight":0.217433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176841,"sim:weight":0.214911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734404,"sim:weight":0.20781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447667,"sim:weight":0.194372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.189918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443364,"sim:weight":0.175344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25067,"sim:weight":0.154106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Yet, since the mid-2000s, contemporary art has accordingly been preoccupied with questions of education and its formats. What is striking about these debates is that—unlike previous generations who formulated the issues of art education in the immediate and obvious terms of what kind of art school would best serve whatever it was thought that art should be—the recent artistic interests in education now look for education beyond the art school, by literally re-placing the site of art education in noninstitutional settings (reading groups, informally organized discussions, artists’ initiatives, web schools, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe line taken in this essay is directed against an assumption that better politics—and something like better art—will happen through the formation of spontaneous communities, of common interests coherently realized, of self-authorized informal educational-artistic endeavors that can nimbly surpass the obvious limitations of the lumbering, sclerotic, or congealed requirements imposed by formal education systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Malik, Suhail"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.336442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.269441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85785,"sim:weight":0.253317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85729,"sim:weight":0.217511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.213497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23491,"sim:weight":0.196128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.191176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.136476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the context of digitization, I argue, social research becomes noticeably a distributed accomplishment: online platforms, users, devices and informational practices actively contribute to the performance of digital social research. This also applies more specifically to social research methods, and this paper explores the phenomenon in relation to two specific digital methods, online network and textual analysis, argueing that sociological research stands much to gain from engaging with it, both normatively and analytically speaking. I distinguish four predominant views on the re-distribution of digital social methods: methods-as-usual, big methods, virtual methods and digital methods. Taking up this last notion, I propose that a re-distributive understanding of social research opens up a new approach to the re-mediation of social methods in digital environments. I develop this argument through a discussion of  two particular online research platforms: the Issue Crawler, a web-based platform for hyperlink analysis, and the Co-Word Machine, an online tool of textual analysis currently under development. Both these tools re-mediate existing social methods, and both, I argue, involve the attempt to render specific methodology critiques effective in the online realm, namely critiques of the authority effects implicit in citation analysis.

Performance, Live or Dead, about re-performance convened by Amelia Jones for a special issue on artists\u0027 performance in Art Journal. Tracking the recent interest in forms of re-enactment by artists, I discuss the exhibition that I curated ‘Not Quite How I Remember It’, at the Power Plant in Toronto, which surveyed contemporary artists’ approaches to remaking and the instability of memory and memorialisation, drawing on Elizabeth Freeman’s conception of queer temporality and temporal drag and Gary Saul Morson’s discussion of ‘sideshadowing’. The contribution considers how the once-challenging promise of artists’ reenactment “is in danger of becoming just another aesthetic trope, a backwards glance that fails to shed light on why and how we remember and represent the past”. Far from reigniting the vitality of past works, contemporary reenactment projects give a sense of earlier works as museological—even mausoleum-like, suggesting that once-radical art has become codified and canonized as just another genre, devoid of its original meaning and impact. I conclude by looking at the work of artists such as Sharon Hayes and Elisabeth Subrin that takes a historically reflexive approach to questions of repetition and remaking, in order to  acknowledge our identifications with earlier countercultural projects, and our earnest yet doomed efforts to access or reignite them through reenactment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reckitt, Helena"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.236927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.206605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.162369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.161942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.158767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176841,"sim:weight":0.155645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.145006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.135759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86055,"sim:weight":0.124768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.124717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443364,"sim:weight":0.121104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446414,"sim:weight":0.111924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The essay argues that Nicolas Bourriaud, the curator responsible for propogating the concept of relational aesthetics, reiterates capitalist exploitation of those who work directly for capitalism, by creating surplus value, as well as domestic labourers of social reproduction who don’t. It discusses important early artistic explorations of the unrecognized role of maintenance labour in sustaining the museum in the art of Mierle Laderman Ukeles, and how her work was revisited in the early 1990s by the artist Janine Antoni. Broadening from Bourriaud’s aversion to identity-based politics, the essay explores the gender-based prejudices that have  influenced the reception of stereotypically ‘women’s work’ in the artworld. The essay concludes by discussing recent curatorial efforts both to highlight service-based art by feminists and to account for the increased importance of affective labour within the current precarious cultural economy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reckitt, Helena","Dimitrakaki, Angela","Perry, Lara"],"dc:date":"2013","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.31971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.291013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929930,"sim:weight":0.286511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.278715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447426,"sim:weight":0.26843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930822,"sim:weight":0.24437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.217682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.207371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930364,"sim:weight":0.184142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.175184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It describes how a matrix framework was used to help teams to create, maintain and develop their self-identity. The primary aim is to increase what the authors call \u0027network consciousness\u0027 (Backwell \u0026 Wood, 2009), in which consciousness is described as a ‘low-grade system for keeping records’ (Minsky, in Horgan, 1993). This concept may be controversial as it embodies a digital, therefore, coarse-grained methodology for mapping (shared) consciousness. Also, by depicting animate and inanimate entities as agencies that are dynamic and equal in status; and by emphasizing relations rather than players, we aim to develop an emancipatory approach that transcends the dualistic mindset. Using this digital approach, data about all relations and their interdependencies are recorded as a set of signature \u0027profiles\u0027. These are then aggregated as a macroscopic snapshot of the whole system. Whenever the community’s salient characteristics grow into a self-similar form that can be made acknowledged by each agent, irrespective of location, we describe this as a ‘self-organized criticality’, or ‘SOC’ (Bak, Tang \u0026 Wiesenfeld, 1987). Its fractal nature also makes it easier for the team to envisage what might happen if their environment were to be scaled-up, or down. It thus renders the system suitable for attracting implicit consensus within a given team. Furthermore, it inherently considers impact upon that beyond the remit of the team and, thereby, ‘seeding’ new and coherent behaviour without the need for top-down management.\r\nKEYWORDS: metadesign, holarchy, synergy, network-consciousness","bibo:AuthorList":["Backwell, John L.","Wood, John"],"dc:date":"2011-11-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.262073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.23978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.218909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.215845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.211029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.207257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Pseudo-Dionysius brought together Greek and Biblical currents of negative theology and the via negativa. The apophatic concepts and metaphors which appear in the work of Pseudo-Dionysius are identified. The psychology of Jung can be read as a continuation and extension of the apophatic tradition. The presence of neoplatonic themes in Jung’s work is discussed, as well as his references to Pseudo-Dionysius. There is a thorough examination of Jung’s discussion of opposites, including his reception of Nicholas of Cusa’s concept of the coincidence of opposites. The role of the transcendent function in Jung’s psychology is reviewed. The work of contemporary scholars of religion, philosophers and Jungian theorists are compared to Jung’s using the lens of apophasis. There is an exploration of ways in which motifs in Pseudo-Dionysius’ Ecclesiatical Hierarchy resonate with contemporary psychoanalytic psychotherapy.

This art form, it will be argued, must necessarily be completely conceptual, devoid of any object which might become sundered to these objectifying forces. Just such a form, might be appealed to in order that the subject can feign an escape from absolute objectivity at the hands of the nihilising influence of science. Can the concept of freedom as an artistic declaration help the human to evade reification, in a way that can co-exist with accepted scientific findings; namely the clear base materiality of the \u0027subject\u0027, and the finitude of subjectivity, as signalled by Brassier and the absolute contingency of Quentin Meillassoux?\r\n\r\nExamining the implications of Duchamp\u0027s \u0027anything can be art\u0027 admixed with Beuys\u0027 \u0027We are all artists,\u0027 the study draws, in its latter third, on examinations of Adorno\u0027s \u0027shudder\u0027 made in the first chapter, in order to conceive of a means by which the subject may overturn its objectification via the declaration of its own subjectivity even in face of the falsity of this premise.

Our goal was to examine the association between parent-rated sleep problems during childhood and neuropsychological functioning during adolescence.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS AND METHODS. Longitudinal prospective data on an entire birth cohort from Dunedin, New Zealand, were obtained. One thousand thirty-seven children were enrolled in the study (52% male). Parents reported on sleep problems when the study members were 5, 7, and 9 years of age. Neuropsychological functioning was\r\nassessed by using 7 tests when the participants were 13 years of age.\r\n\r\nRESULTS. After adjusting for gender and socioeconomic status, persistent sleep problems during childhood predicted scores on 2 neuropsychological tests: the copy score of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test and 2 measures of performance on the Halstead Trail Making Test. These results were substantively replicated when sleep was assessed at the 5- and 9-year (but not 7-year) assessments separately.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS. Sleep problems during childhood may be associated with certain aspects of neuropsychological functioning during adolescence. This adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that childhood sleep problems may be a risk indicator of later difficulties.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gregory, Alice M.","Caspi, A.","Moffitt, T.

Three key ideas of May 68 are related to the ATLG and their relevance to other psychotherapies and psychotherapy trainings is considered. These are: the importance of the ‘capitalist’ university as an essential terrain in the struggle for social change; the Atelier Populaire’s use of art in an anti capitalist critique of the commodification of art and artist in society; and the anti imperialist character of the May events. These ideas are related to the theoretical base of the ATLG in the large verbal group literature, performance art and to the wide international membership of the ATLG creating a forum for engaging with global issues. To illustrate these points, we give an example of the interface of the political and the impact of a real event, the university lecturers’ strike in 2007 and the learning that took place in relation to this through the ATLG.  We conclude that through a critical engagement with the university within the global terrain of contemporary neo-liberalism, the ATLG provides a territory that can: integrates the political and therapeutic in arts/psychotherapy trainings; provides a critique and alternative to the commodification of art and artist; engages with issues of difference in the globalized market place. The ATLG prepares the artist/student/therapist/worker to critically engage in the personal and social transformation of the politics of art and psychotherapy provision in the public, private and voluntary sectors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Kevin","Skaife, Sally"],"dc:date":"2009-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999545,"sim:weight":0.475524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.396826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.357171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340778,"sim:weight":0.335533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.32641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.233533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.223372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.206072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.198709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Yet, in the last couple of decades, policy-makers and social scientists have increasingly sought to capitalize on faith by asking whether it produces social capital. In the context of faith-based social action in communities, this book asks what becomes of faiths when seen as social capital? Is the social subjugated to the capital part of the equation? As the debt crisis took hold, doesn’t the relationship between the social and capital seem increasingly unbalanced? Using new research, theory and critical analysis, this book asks whether faiths can help rebalance society in favour of the human scale of life in communities, focusing on the value of the ordinary relationships which are already there, regardless of their wider ‘use’.\r\n\r\nReview\r\n\r\n‘Not only is this book a wonderful introduction to what faith-based social action contributes to the UK today, it also puts forward a striking and significant argument. Dinham suggests that the notion of ‘social capital’, fashionable with policy-makers and faith groups alike, has been so hollowed out that it fails to make sense of faith’s distinctive contributions to society – good and bad. Faith has many dimensions, not least reverence for what is good, true and Godly. To judge it in terms of the ‘capital’ it can generate is to subject it to a market logic which turns it into a mere instrument of social policy and economic progress’. – Linda Woodhead, Professor of the Sociology of Religion, Lancaster University and Director of the AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society Programme, UK","bibo:AuthorList":["Dinham, Adam"],"dc:date":"2012-04-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.286542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.259388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.243703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.224461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.223019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176792,"sim:weight":0.221446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999507,"sim:weight":0.220423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.216331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109179,"sim:weight":0.202744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We have recently reported increased gray matter concentration in several brain areas in boys with psychopathic traits. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: To explore whether these gray matter concentration differences can be regarded as endophenotypes for psychopathic traits by (1) assessing their heritability and (2) examining the etiology of the co-occurrence of psychopathic traits and increased gray matter concentration. \r\n\r\nDESIGN: Community twin sample. \r\n\r\nSETTING: On-campus neuroimaging facility. Patients or Other \r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-three male twins (56 monozygotic and 67 dizygotic individuals; mean age 11.55 years; range, 10-13 years). \r\n\r\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We analyzed structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Voxel-based morphometry analyses were used to obtain gray matter concentration values that were analyzed in a biometrical genetic twin model. RESULTS: Left posterior cingulate and right dorsal anterior cingulate gray matter concentrations were found to be the strongest endophenotype markers, with heritability estimates of 46% and 37%, respectively, and common genes explaining the phenotypic relationship between these regions and psychopathic traits. No significant heritabilities were found for several regions, including the right orbitofrontal cortex and insula. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that structural endophenotypes, in the form of variations in gray matter concentration, reflect genetic vulnerability for psychopathic traits. Specifically, gray matter concentration in the left posterior cingulate and right dorsal anterior cingulate, brain areas implicated in empathy, moral processing, and introspection, are potential candidate endophenotypes for psychopathic traits.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rijsdijsk, Fruhling V","Viding, Essi","De Brito, Stéphane","Forgiarini, Matteo","Mechelli, Andrea","Jones, Alice P.","McCrory, Eamon"],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1445598,"sim:weight":0.215077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1925580,"sim:weight":0.145523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443586,"sim:weight":0.133523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443251,"sim:weight":0.114068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.0978881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109165,"sim:weight":0.0903823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70652,"sim:weight":0.0899783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66187,"sim:weight":0.0833605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26759,"sim:weight":0.0630934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.0559855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the importance of sensorimotor representations in modalities outside of vision remains unknown. Here we use continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) to investigate whether neural activity in the right postcentral gyrus (rPoG) and right lateral premotor cortex (rPM) is involved in nonverbal auditory emotion recognition. Three groups of participants completed same-different tasks on auditory stimuli, discriminating between the emotion expressed and the speakers\u0027 identities, before and following cTBS targeted at rPoG, rPM, or the vertex (control site). A task-selective deficit in auditory emotion discrimination was observed.

This article addresses new techniques of psychiatric power and therapeutic epistemologies that have emerged in present-day military-scientific as well as media technological assemblages to define and capture the human in its psychobiological states of emergency. Specifically, the focus of this article is on one special kind of screen medium, called Virtual Iraq, a virtual reality device designed to treat post-traumatic stress disorder among war veterans. The article analyses Virtual Iraq as an example of new forms and strategies for the management of affectivity and memory that have been developed in conjunction with contemporary neuroscientific discourses on the evolutionary origins of emotional life and its neurobiological functionality among humans qua species. Furthermore, it discusses Virtual Iraq as an example of the biopolitical work of contemporary screen media in which the reality of images starts to concern the organism\u0027s internal functioning instead of being anthropological or communicative, tapping into the brain\u0027s capacity of self-organization as well as contributing to the production and maintenance of psychological immunity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Valiaho, Pasi"],"dc:date":"2012-03-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69398,"sim:weight":0.31157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108509,"sim:weight":0.276447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734404,"sim:weight":0.258611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795071,"sim:weight":0.246769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.223717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109076,"sim:weight":0.216135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445655,"sim:weight":0.205534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.196291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108479,"sim:weight":0.194658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85183,"sim:weight":0.191926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.189272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The compromises necessary to pass the declaration—along with the opinions expressed in the parliamentary debate—show that this event was not a turning point in Serbia’s process of confronting the past, but a confirmation of the country’s deep ideological and political divisions. The declaration’s principal aim was to satisfy the European Union’s expectations and bolster Serbia’s project of seeking EU membership. The EU’s conditionality policy has thus been effective in achieving official gestures of atonement like the Srebrenica Declaration. However, the EU’s approach also diverts attention from the long-term domestic process of value transformation and the building of a civic public culture to a narrow focus on short-term measures aimed foremost at satisfying external demands.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dragovic-Soso, Jasna"],"dc:date":"2012-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Boldrini shows that this mode is widely employed to reflect critically on the historical and philosophical understanding of the human; on individual identity; and on the power relationships that define the subject. In such texts, the grammatical first person becomes the site of an encounter, a stage where the relationships between historical, fictional and authorial subjectivities are played out and explored in the ‘double I’ of author and narrating historical character, of fictional narrator and historical person. Boldrini considers the ethical implications of assuming another’s first-person voice, and the fraught issue of authorial responsibility. Constructions of the body are examined in relation to the material evidence of the subject’s existence. Texts studied include Malouf’s An Imaginary Life, Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang, Ondaatje’s The Collected Works of Billy the Kid, Adair’s The Death of the Author, Banti’s Artemisia, Vázquez Montalbán’s Autobiografía del general Franco.

{"identifier":8746736,"ep:Repository":50,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Reconstructing Beethoven: Mauricio Kagel’s Ludwig van","bibo:abstract":"The subject of this dissertation is Ludwig van, Mauricio Kagel’s tribute to Beethoven on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the latter’s birth, which consists of three separate, but closely related, versions: a film, a musical score and a recording. The main aim of this project is to analyse the performance problems that musicians have to face when realising the score Ludwig van, which is an entirely indeterminate collage of Beethoven’s music, and to suggest ways of tackling them. For this purpose, all three versions of the work are studied in this thesis. The film is examined in terms of the issues it raises concerning Beethoven’s reception and of the function of its music, which consists of unusual performances of Beethoven’s works. The score is analysed from the perspective of postmodern theory and 20th-century art movements, while the roles of the composer and the performer are discussed and redefined. The recording is studied as a sample of how Kagel himself chose to realise his own score. Finally, the difficulties I encountered in my own attempts to realise Ludwig van are discussed, and the ways in which I dealt with them are presented. The conclusion at which this dissertation arrives is that, in works of such indeterminacy as Ludwig van, the performers are required to step outside their conventional role and act partly as composers. Compared to works that are considered challenging to the performer in the conventional sense, of requiring technical virtuosity, this work presents a more fundamental challenge, which has to do with overcoming personal boundaries: it asks the performer not to execute a pre-composed work, but to create their own version of Ludwig van. Since very little has been written about Ludwig van by performers with an academic background, this thesis can offer valuable assistance to prospective performers of the work in their attempt to balance between the highly charged conceptual aspect of the composition and the practical need to achieve its successful performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stavlas, Nikolaos"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It addresses two questions which have previously rarely been addressed in the literature.  1. Whether and if so in what ways do parents of different backgrounds support their children in learning Mandarin as a second or a foreign language?  2. How is this affected by social, cultural as well as the parents’ own educational experience? \r\n\r\nHere the most relevant socio-cultural theories of learning: prolepsis; guided participation; syncretism; synergy and funds of knowledge have been studied.  Ethnographic research was conducted on six families chosen from three categories: families in which both parents had Chinese heritage; one parent had Chinese heritage and those in which neither parent had a Chinese background.  Data were collected through participant observation and interviews.\r\n\r\nThe method of multi-layering was applied to analyze these data: the outer layer- social and cultural background, the middle layer- supporting strategies and the inner layer- the pedagogic methods used by the parents.  \r\n\r\nThe results reveal that these parents were determined to assist their children’s learning and employed different methods: both direct (teaching) and indirect (providing access to resources, cultural activities and events).  All parents set aside time for formal, serious, regular (school-like) learning sessions.  The support they provided was affected significantly by their social, cultural and educational background.  All enhanced their children’s motivation and learning achievement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chung, Yu-Chiao"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
