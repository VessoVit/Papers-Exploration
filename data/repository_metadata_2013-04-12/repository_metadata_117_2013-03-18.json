Gell’s concept of enchantment, but also his interpretation of the status of the artwork as provisional\r\nand problematic, rather than aesthetically or semiotically determined, is deployed as a means of creating a productively meaningful relationship between art and magic, both of which can be said to occlude the ‘abduction’ of agency in distinctive ways. Finally, Gell’s concept of agency provides a robust yet fluid set of paradigms for exploring the mobile, tripartite relationship between artist,artwork, and spectator.\u0027","bibo:AuthorList":["Gilhooly, Jonathan"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.658153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8779968,"sim:weight":0.653905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.626233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.625519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.612036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.60992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.603732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2783520,"sim:weight":0.602039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.601724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382006,"sim:weight":0.596163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734401,"sim:weight":0.593417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.589036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.584799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.582399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46627,"sim:weight":0.582312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44028,"sim:weight":0.581439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.568266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.566462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44852,"sim:weight":0.566462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.566137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

From the European architects who first noticed them at the turn of the century to the generations of American artists who still document them, all have continued to renew the meaning of the elevator through their work. American artists, in particular, developed a certain way in which they recorded the elevator.  They emphasized the elevator’s context, whether rural farmland or urban industrial landscape, and its identity as an American object, thereby setting themselves apart from the Europeans who were interested primarily in the building’s form – a quality that transcends cultural boundaries.  Both groups of artists, however, strove to extract the spiritual essence of the grain elevator, without altering its integrity as an object, and transformed it from a common vernacular structure to a building of iconic stature.” Aldo Rossi\r\n\r\nBREAKING THE PLAIN takes as its centre an image of a model – a representation of the generalised form of the rural wood elevator that has been lost over time. The family albums accessible to Johnson offered up numerous and varied photographs of elevators built by her grandfather. His movements across the Great Plains can be plotted via inscription and recall. Working from one of the images in the archive, Johnson has created a flat-pack, collapsible, portable elevator that provides an opportunity for ‘performances’ and narrative constructions. The monumentalized and iconic structure of the elevator is reduced to a domestic scale – photographic and architectural sizing provide the arena for showing, telling, journeying. Filmed on super 8, the flat-pack is assembled and flattened alongside a recording of Johnson and her father discussing the location order of the constructions. This work opens up a triangular dialogue between image, object, and the body and sets out to explore how the vernacular document becomes a site for re-enactment, and draws attention to the instability and fragility of structuring memory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, Christy"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The work as a whole aims to explore how the female body is socially and sexually constructed through transformative religious ritual; contemporary practices of intervention and the museum; collecting, re(collecting) and the relationship of artefact and memory; and the archive as a site of reclamation and narration. Through critical intervention, found material has been mobilised and the ’record’ put in question.

Johnson is particularly interested in the document as a ritual space, and how the book form can become a site for discursive interplay.\r\n\r\nShe has created and drawn upon two distinct but related archives: found photographic imagery (the appropriated record) and contemporary spoken narratives whereby the past and present are brought into contact with each other. She has sought and collected hundreds of First Communion photographic images from various countries in the Americas and Europe. The anonymous portraits span the years 1877-1970. The bookwork features the photographs of prepubescent girls and explores their performative staging as \u0027virginal brides\u0027 for the public communal event, as well as the private photographic record. Alongside the visual archive, Johnson has conducted interviews with thirty-three women of differing social backgrounds and nationalities, ages and current involvement and position to religion. The edited text excerpts have been taken from the audio archive and juxtaposed with the found images in order to oppose, support, challenge, complement, contradict, subvert, or go beyond the meanings offered by the photographs themselves.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the work, three essays provide an interdisciplinary perspective on the project:\r\n\r\n•Archival Memories: Between History and Experience (pp.182-89) Margherita Sprio, Lecturer and Scheme Director MA Art and Film, Department of Art History and Theory, University of Essex, UK\r\n\r\n•Retrieval and Transmittal in a Fictive Photographic Experience (pp.190-97) Catherine Clinger, Visiting Professor of Art History, Department of Art and Art History, University of New Mexico, USA\r\n\r\n•All in White for the Feast: Whiteness in the Christian Imaginary (pp.198-205) Jenny Daggers, Senior Lecturer in Theology and Religious Studies, Liverpool Hope University, UK\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHIC INSTALLATION\r\nOculorium Gallery\r\nUCR/ California Museum of Photography, USA\r\nCurated by Ciara Ennis\r\n\r\nFeast: Christy Johnson and 33 Confessors \r\n108 - 92 h x 61 w cm Lambda prints on Fugi archival paper\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nThis floor to ceiling installation plundered the Feast archive, a depository of more than 400 found First Communion commemorative pictures from Europe and the Americas (1877-1970). A selection of 108 images enlarged and printed in colour (digital photographic Lambda prints) were presented in a three-row grid format on four walls that literally enveloped and surrounded the viewer - an army of pre-teen girls dressed in white. The anonymous photographic portraits explore and critique the initiatory performance of gender in ritual contexts (both sacred and secular), particularly addressing notions of purity and contamination. These monumentalised images become celebratory markers of an emergent prepubescent sexuality and desire. The fetishised ‘virginal bride’ motif once safely and happily in place, now reaches the challenging excesses of the fantastically bizarre. The size is a renunciation of where these photographs were originally placed, and the spectator confronted by a re-viewing.  The sheer scale of the work exposes the physical nature of the First Communion event (both in the church and photographer’s studio) and sets out to deconstruct this important symbolic moment. Female sexuality is not located in a comfortable place … it is not clear where it is … it is not fixed. Confronting the images, two voices emerge in dialogue (wall texts) where amnesia and sharp recall explore the flux of denial and excess.\r\n\r\nVIDEO INSTALLATION\r\nProject Space\r\nUCR/ California Museum of Photography, USA\r\nCurated by Ciara Ennis\r\n\r\nThe Set \r\nVideo triptych with continuous sound (projection/two 382 cm monitors)\u0026 prayer cushion seating\r\n32 minute, synchronized loop (5 x 5 minutes sequences)\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nThis installation explores the authorial nature of the First Communion rituals - rote performances in the Church move seamlessly to mock performances in the studio. The Set draws on the artifice of the recorded climatic moment (fixed image). This video work is a continuous re-enactment of five photographic portraits drawn from the Feast archive, and points to the absent, unseen event that is re-done (staged) for the photographer. The representational conventions that are to be adhered to (as with wedding photography) are exposed simply through a reflexive approach where the children hold their performances in the anticipation of the release.\r\n\r\nGender as performance is explored in terms of how boys and girls are expected to behave. Being good and acting as you are told breaks down in each of the five sequences with each child monitoring the other. The sound of a cough, sneeze, whisper or movement of the body reverberates in the studio, breaking and punctuating the monotonous real-time action.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, Christy"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.551878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46776,"sim:weight":0.545087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.544506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.539618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44304,"sim:weight":0.534042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352208,"sim:weight":0.523524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45867,"sim:weight":0.504849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48412,"sim:weight":0.504539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.502803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45831,"sim:weight":0.492804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48270,"sim:weight":0.492089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.48546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383589,"sim:weight":0.482948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352185,"sim:weight":0.470914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.465262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381913,"sim:weight":0.452096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47600,"sim:weight":0.434187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.42541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15239,"sim:weight":0.423112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44650,"sim:weight":0.41668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A performance took place – a photograph taken every 5 minutes – giving evidence to the initiatory experience of experiencing extreme heat and using birch to stimulate the skin. The individual SX-70s were sutured onto the existing metal grill separating the viewer from the sauna space.

These ‘experiments’ are so\r\ncalled rather than ‘workshops’ because their nature is essentially exploratory and open-ended; they are not designed to transmit a body of skills, for example, or to progress through exercises. In fact, the experiments have something of the spirit of CLTAD 2010 with Susan Orr’s talk, ‘Reflect on this!’ (CLTAD 2010) in that there is a prioritizing of students’ primary practice and mode of working.  Howard Riley’s notion of the ‘visual essay’ (CLTAD 2010) has also taken up this baton.

Creative businesses include: advertising, the arts, crafts, design, fashion, digital media, film and video, games design, graphic communication, music and performing arts.

It brought together work by Anna Boggon, Silke Dettmers and Helen Maurer, three artists employing the language of what one could call the \u0027contemporary surreal\u0027 (\u0027The Wrong End of the Telescope\u0027, Three Colts Gallery, London). The history and concept of the Wunderkammer is critical for the argument pursued in this article, which calls for the re-instatement of \u0027wonder\u0027 and the idea of \u0027the marvellous\u0027. These are vital ingredients for visual arts practice but are unacknowledged in today\u0027s art academies. It takes on board the current debate of \u0027visual arts practice as research\u0027 and extends the argument of authors such as Sullivan (Art Practice as Research, 2005) and Barone, by demonstrating conventional academic definitions of \u0027knowledge\u0027 and artistic practice to be irreconcilable. The importance of not knowing. Wunderkammern and Curiosity Cabinets. Some thoughts on the real, the surreal and the contemporary surreal. The aspirations of words and the difficulties with \u0027proof\u0027. Heterotopias.

The sequential progression of the multiplied frames is metaphorically re-counted as the film is run backwards and forwards. As Arnold describes it: ‘I start with frame x, go forward to frame x+1 and then from x+1 back again through x to x-1.’ From the original’s order of 1–2–3 with pièce touchée we arrive at a new count, something like 1–2–1–0.\r\n \r\n\r\nThis paper will argue that there are three modes of love present in this filmic recount. First, the normative love presented in the original’s scene, a husband returning home to a wife. The second love is that of the (mis)identification with an ideal image, an ambivalent scene of narcissism and aggressivity: what Jacques Lacan terms ‘hainamoration’. Such a condition is demonstrated through Arnold’s re-arrangement, which lingers over the filmic body whilst doing violence to its narrative unity. The final form of love under discussion will be what Alain Badiou terms ‘the scene of the Two’: a disjunctive scene that refuses the fusional ideal, posing love as a shared investigation of the universe.","bibo:AuthorList":["Summers, Francis"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":106642,"sim:weight":0.144515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.112596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15239,"sim:weight":0.112161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9559,"sim:weight":0.104963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15176,"sim:weight":0.0994112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16699,"sim:weight":0.0959989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74126,"sim:weight":0.092468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2927,"sim:weight":0.0917461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2916,"sim:weight":0.0881232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9840,"sim:weight":0.0868661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.0832764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2888,"sim:weight":0.0815564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73892,"sim:weight":0.075909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5084,"sim:weight":0.0756729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2907,"sim:weight":0.0695208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4484,"sim:weight":0.055321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The installation examines notions of performance and \u0027live\u0027 art using projections onto multiple screens.  The theme of the bird, the Eagle, is carried through into the new installation and used as an object/prop within the projections.   \r\n\r\nThe viewer experiences multiple views from different camera angles and their non-synchronised timelines and sound creates overlaps and repeats; this repetition playing on notions of time and duration.  The screen configuration also echoes the mechanism of film production, its rhythms of flow and interruption, to be experienced as a physical and spatial phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe Eagle Document was originally inspired by Marcel Broodthaers\u0027 Musée d\u0027Art Moderne, a critical commentary on art production at the end of the modernist period. Broodthaers challenged the notion of the permanent art collection, the museum and the status of the art object by creating a series of nomadic, non-permanent and fictitious museum collections. One of these fictitious collections The Département d\u0027Aigles (a collection of diverse eagle paraphernalia) cancelled the status of the eagle as a symbol of power and reappropriated the art objects as a method of display.\r\n\r\nThe installation borrows Broodthaers device \u0027the object as method\u0027 and investigates the \u0027object\u0027 within expanded art concepts.  Both choreography and action are reminiscent of the early video performances of Marina Abramovic and Rebecca Horn.\r\n\r\nThe work also looks at \u0027body and space\u0027 a familiar theme in performance art.  The installation contrasts the closed space of performance with the open space of the installation. Thus viewing and experiencing the work involves the onlooker navigating the space and assembling images and sounds.","bibo:AuthorList":["Oechsler, Monika"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43543,"sim:weight":0.373074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103471,"sim:weight":0.334697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.281901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634681,"sim:weight":0.279266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.269754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710128,"sim:weight":0.260303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051962,"sim:weight":0.248898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.24882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710190,"sim:weight":0.247041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.246478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23713,"sim:weight":0.244839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.242181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145186,"sim:weight":0.241397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051961,"sim:weight":0.241261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103424,"sim:weight":0.240803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183823,"sim:weight":0.234025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.232246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447920,"sim:weight":0.230984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101399,"sim:weight":0.227046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8770865,"sim:weight":0.220482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This work continues Johnson\u0027s interest in and use of \u0027found\u0027 material (16mm wind tunnel footage), and performative methods (sound recording of Channel 9 on United Airlines). This immersive work explores the turbulence of suspension and sets out to map the interval between take off and landing. Windblown soil and non-diegetic sound create a journey ‘between’, a spatial dislocation. Two distinct views of the momentum of airflow are edited and looped in order to prevent the viewer from experiencing the resolution of settled earth. As with the sound, the image has no beginning or end.\r\n\r\nIn the Hangár space, a monitor with headphones, and a padded seat sits between the projections. The fluttering material moves forward and backwards akin to a paper airplane that never takes off. The material removed from the pilot recording is now re-inserted – a sound flicker of static noise.\r\n\r\nAirborne provided a space for actions and spontaneous responses by the visiting dancers at the Festival. Two undirected dance interventions by renowned artist Márta Ladjánszki took place – one for a live audience and the other for camera. This recorded performance (12 min) has resulted in a short film entitled HANGÁR (July 2008).","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, Christy"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931409,"sim:weight":0.312205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.290152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710128,"sim:weight":0.277276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9537874,"sim:weight":0.275966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101626,"sim:weight":0.271424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101399,"sim:weight":0.258731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101428,"sim:weight":0.251538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101260,"sim:weight":0.246489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051962,"sim:weight":0.246098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6204223,"sim:weight":0.236691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43823,"sim:weight":0.218159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.216938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145186,"sim:weight":0.216852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.216814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43543,"sim:weight":0.214731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.207075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051959,"sim:weight":0.204757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051961,"sim:weight":0.202351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634681,"sim:weight":0.201261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103471,"sim:weight":0.198496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Johnson worked directly with the Natural History archivist via the Hampshire Museum Service, using waterfowl material in their collection (moorhen, shoveler, coot, canada goose, mute swan, grey heron). Utilising what Fox-Talbot described in the 19th century as ‘the pencil of nature’, the photogram was chosen to articulate shape, rejecting the camera’s monocular vantage point.\r\n\r\nExchanges between image and sound were created via a dialogue between the interior and exterior space.

COUNTERPARTS\r\nDan Fuller, Christy Johnson, Suzanne Marshall\r\nWool Warehouse,\r\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico, USA\r\n\r\n\"Christy Johnson\u0027s photographic assemblages are aggressive. The pieces are large, confrontational, figural images in a frenetically organized pictorial space combined with sculptural elements that are often architecturally sited. However, unlike the cool detached qualities sometimes associated with the photographic medium, these pieces capitalize on their vigorous physical and material features conveying a strong sense of directness and immediacy. The themes in Johnson\u0027s work are as complex and interwoven as are the elements of the process that she uses to produce the work. Drawing on an extensive network of associational visual clues, Johnson places her solitary collaborating subjects in a shallow, multi-layered field populated with collections of objects (animal, vegetable, mineral) and various kinds of patterned materials. She then paints directly on the model, and occasionally the other compositional elements, to effect a disconcerting sense of spatial ambiguity and the general \u0027disappearance\u0027 of the figure. In a sense, she paints the figure out. Long before the current series of works, her entire procedure, including the subsequent photographic \u0027leveling\u0027 of the image, served Johnson as an analogue for the profound depersonalizing process at work in contemporary western culture. That all of her imagery is also laden with themes of sexual confrontation, inauthenticity, isolation and obliteration is but further testimony to the fundamental sense of alienation that she sees affecting human relationships. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of artists in recent years associated with the University of New Mexico who have produced disturbing and unforgettable photographic images; Joel Peter Witkin perhaps the most well known among them. Christy Johnson’s work matches Witkin’s in its power to disturb and call to full force subversive agendas of the human psyche. But where his photographs remained locked within the conventions of their medium, Johnson has flagrantly violated many of the aesthetic precepts of convention. The net affect is that she has produced physical objects charged with the elusive energy that is in itself the subject of her imagery.  This represents the very best of what a contra-conventional manipulation of media has to offer for the expression of deeply held humanistic concerns.” Jason Knapp","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, Christy"],"dc:date":"1989","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.317053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710015,"sim:weight":0.305363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.284483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43037,"sim:weight":0.28336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46611,"sim:weight":0.281058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.279832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.277436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.273339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.27054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.267941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.266413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105058,"sim:weight":0.263108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.257384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.25063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.244212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643985,"sim:weight":0.241807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.240919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84996,"sim:weight":0.240484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051962,"sim:weight":0.235981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352169,"sim:weight":0.235717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

University for the Creative Arts (UCA) Rochester previously undertook a couple of small-scale pilots using podcasting to support the student induction process and learning and teaching. Both pilots proved successful however the ad hoc approach left lots of questions unanswered, and raised many others, particularly around the collection of materials, storage and usage of podcasts and the management of the whole process. \r\n\r\nThis project research question was: \"Do disabled and dyslexic students feel that podcasting helps them to engage with learning and teaching in Art and Design? And how?\"\r\n\r\nThere were a number of reasons for the focus on disabled and dyslexic students. Firstly, there have been a growing number of dyslexic and disabled students at the Rochester campus over the past few years, therefore, a growing number of these students were accessing support equipment such as Dictaphones with which they would make their own recordings. Secondly, course tutors were also trying to adapt their teaching in response to this growing number of dyslexic and disabled students and had approached all the team members of this research project to find a way of recording there lectures. While we focused on this group of students, it was anticipated that what helped disabled and dyslexic students would help all students engage with learning and teaching.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hannaford, Lucy","Marsh, Phillip","Matysova, Claire"],"dc:date":"2011-01-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8933572,"sim:weight":0.405341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.405341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108976,"sim:weight":0.37841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.358589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67048,"sim:weight":0.354851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13201,"sim:weight":0.32721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.326768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.31509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145950,"sim:weight":0.31223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.310375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.295127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.292558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.292396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.286858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78191,"sim:weight":0.277327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.27661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.266086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105141,"sim:weight":0.253255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151759,"sim:weight":0.253033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27100,"sim:weight":0.243361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

She engages with spatial issues pertinent to our times including those of the environment, cultural identity and belonging, experiences of displacement, migration and marginalisation and effects of urbanisation and tourism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rugg, Judith"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.270415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.260425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200388,"sim:weight":0.254124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103460,"sim:weight":0.233782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.208996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.203763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65251,"sim:weight":0.196702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2888,"sim:weight":0.184118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.173689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101270,"sim:weight":0.172556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.17005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103424,"sim:weight":0.167813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48332,"sim:weight":0.16577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340689,"sim:weight":0.161615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771816,"sim:weight":0.160203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9024659,"sim:weight":0.158947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187631,"sim:weight":0.157587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734404,"sim:weight":0.157409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199817,"sim:weight":0.156341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710015,"sim:weight":0.1551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Creating something out of nothing or changing the way the viewer looks at the world, challenging what is perceived as real and providing visual stimulus is what the artist is expected to do. There is an association with or assumption of magic to artistic practice. As if an artist fulfils the role of a present day sorcerer or alchemist. This work explores the magic of the creative process and the punishment an artist endures for taking this path.\r\n\r\nThe installation was exhibited in the \u0027Allotments\u0027 exhibition at the Schwartz Gallery 2010.

When I got home I began to work out my monthly in-comings and outgoings, rent, travel, food etc... with the intention of forming some kind of repayment plan. I got frustrated and looked down at the pen I was writing with; the branded blue pen from the bank. Printed on the spine of the pen was the phrase ‘Borrowed from my bank’. I decided to see how much ‘ink’ I could ‘borrow from my bank’. I started to fill in each square on A3 graph paper until the ink ran out. I wanted to see if I could fill the page or not. In the same way I try to stretch my wages and manage debt each month. As the project progressed I started to use the ink to depict specific financial data related to particular financial institutions and their/our  role in this recession. \r\n\r\nEach of these drawings is made using all the ink from a single ball point pen.

They have over time become ingrained in the collective psyche of a nation, just as green is associated with the Irish; red fulfils a similar role here in the UK. When Éire gained independence from the UK, people went out on to the streets and painted the post boxes [then red], green an act which represented the reclamation of a nation by its citizens. This held a symbolic power similar to the red post box that withstood the Manchester IRA bombing to become a symbol of British resilience. \r\nIt is because post boxes have come to represent such a strong symbol of national identity that makes them the perfect symbol to illustrate an aspect of the European Union’s effect on the sense of national identity within its twenty-seven individual member states. Painting post boxes blue [the colour commonly associated with the EU] changes their traditional role, as symbols of national identity and history.

He presented the video like a painting on canvas alongside Dutch paintings from the eighteenth century. The journey to Europe ends with close‐ups of St Mary’s Square with St Mary’s Church in Utrecht (1765) by the Dutch painter Pieter Saenredam, thus ostensibly establishing continuity between ‘documentary realism’ and the realist tradition of painting. This relationship is complicated by refraction through the self‐reflexive aesthetic of German Romanticism, particularly as the figure of the film‐maker in the video functions as a Romantic Rückenfigur (back‐view figure) within which documentary subjectivity and self‐reflexivity are recast.","bibo:AuthorList":["Panse, Silke"],"dc:date":"2006-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1443361,"sim:weight":0.259475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.217786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051961,"sim:weight":0.215582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48277,"sim:weight":0.213645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5226933,"sim:weight":0.208402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45332,"sim:weight":0.206577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382026,"sim:weight":0.206291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.203093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.188714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99028,"sim:weight":0.186926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43037,"sim:weight":0.186647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381975,"sim:weight":0.18141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.180524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.177273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383083,"sim:weight":0.176485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43223,"sim:weight":0.173251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46714,"sim:weight":0.162608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731334,"sim:weight":0.162363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85495,"sim:weight":0.161865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45046,"sim:weight":0.161577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Narratives exist, but they all too often treat interior design as a function of architecture or display rather than experience. The chapter maps the architecture, spaces and objects of the Quay Brothers\u0027 films, and of Street of Crocodiles in particular, by investigating how the architectural constructions and materials create the spatialities particular to the film\u0027s notably experimental narrative \u0027world\u0027. Distinct from the \u0027mythic\u0027 origins of their preferred authors\u0027 descriptions of matter, the objects, architecture, décors and other elements in their set designs for theatre and opera and their films\u0027 mise-en-scène have physical, tangible origins; they are constructed out of a variety of materials, including mirrors, posters, fabrics, glass, wood and metal. The films\u0027 sets are considered in a framework of Juan Antonio Ramirez\u0027s cinematic set design, collage principles, the concept of the miniature, Walter Benjamin\u0027s notion of detritus. It concludes that the Quay Brothers\u0027 engagement with spatial themes of inside / outside and imagined / experienced may mirror our own continual negotiation between the physical, phenomenal and a metaphysical world\u0027.

The chapter considers how animation is pervasive in video games, advertising, music videos, and is increasingly featured in forms of hybrid and blended media. Not only does cinematic vision now extend beyond the movie theatre, but moving-image culture extends across a large landscape of technologies, media influences, and social relationships. The essay\u0027s trajectory begins with changing conceptions of animation as an art form, the phenomena of animation\u0027s historical exclusion from exhibition, the \u0027high/low\u0027 art divide. These ideas are briefly exemplified by a discussion of some recent exhibitions, to illuminate how relationships between moving image installation and audiences are mediated. While many of the artists in these and other exhibitions are men, there is a growing cohort of women working in animation installation. The essay focuses on the installation works of three women animation artists: Rose Bond, Tabiamo and Marina Zurkow, and reveals resonances and distinctions in their works in terms of animated spaces, worlds and domestic and gendered realms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buchan, Suzanne","Waltraud, Grausgruber","Birgitt, Wagner"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8770865,"sim:weight":0.427117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999538,"sim:weight":0.344224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930822,"sim:weight":0.25836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.256321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.24377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225608,"sim:weight":0.237338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1636448,"sim:weight":0.233413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1636074,"sim:weight":0.226694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710128,"sim:weight":0.223395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43037,"sim:weight":0.221244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929930,"sim:weight":0.217965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771816,"sim:weight":0.215045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634700,"sim:weight":0.208763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48375,"sim:weight":0.204434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447850,"sim:weight":0.196668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771817,"sim:weight":0.186618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652829,"sim:weight":0.185744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.185314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103251,"sim:weight":0.184264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103424,"sim:weight":0.179719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Known for their animation shorts that rely on puppetry, miniatures, and stop-motion techniques, their fiercely idiosyncratic films are fertile fields for Suzanne Buchan\u0027s engaging descriptions and provocative insights into the Quays\u0027 art-and into the art of independent puppet animation.\r\n\r\nBuchan\u0027s aesthetic investigation stems from extensive access to the Quay Brothers\u0027 artistic practices and work, which spans animation and live-action film, stage design and illustration. Discussions of their films\u0027 literary origins, space, puppets, montage, and the often-overlooked world of sound and music in animation shed new light on the expressive world that the Quay Brothers generate out of their materials to create the poetic alchemy of their films.\r\n\r\nAt once a biography of the Quays\u0027 artistic trajectory and a detailed examination of one of their best-known films, Street of Crocodiles, this book goes further and provides interdisciplinary methodologies and tools for the analysis of animation.\r\n\r\nEditorial Reviews\r\n\"Suzanne Buchan’s book offers a welcome introduction to the art of the Brothers Quay, with an emphasis on a detailed reading of their animated film, Street of Crocodiles. The Quay Brothers offers engaging descriptions and thought-provoking insights into the Quays’ art specifically and into the art of animation generally.\" —Thomas Lamarre, McGill University\r\n\r\n\"To use the term Buchan cites from Joyce, this is a fascinating transluding of the Quays’ work into prose. Based on several years’ affectionate acquaintance with the pair, The Quay Brothers is entertaining, often innovative, and highly evocative. A great book on the Quays and on the British scene since the 1970s, it also opens up new avenues for animation and film studies.\" —Sean Cubitt, University of Melbourne","bibo:AuthorList":["Buchan, Suzanne"],"dc:date":"2011-03-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8770865,"sim:weight":0.365358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113848,"sim:weight":0.203382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47288,"sim:weight":0.197484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45332,"sim:weight":0.19062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.187223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.184765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.181173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43693,"sim:weight":0.173426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.171812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445178,"sim:weight":0.167953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.164213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43233,"sim:weight":0.162502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186613,"sim:weight":0.162039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931412,"sim:weight":0.159337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44743,"sim:weight":0.155663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.154971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43037,"sim:weight":0.154334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.151531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182211,"sim:weight":0.150675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44650,"sim:weight":0.148455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Our world is a remnant of others’ loss and will be so for those beyond us: much of our presence is confirmed by what we leave behind us.

{"identifier":1631006,"ep:Repository":117,"dc:type":["Art/Design Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Evaders","bibo:abstract":"Evaders portrays the journey of a singular persona traversing the legendary Lister Route, a passage through the Pyrenees mountains across the French/Spanish border. The passage is surrounded by some of the most exquisitely beautiful and severe vistas accentuated with equally severe elemental conditions. The locals in the region refer to the relentless gusting winds as “Transmontana” and claim that it has the power to make travelers go mad.\r\n\r\nThe making of this film, as with much of Gersht’s work, was engaged as a kind of expeditionary journey, with unanticipated environmental phenomena influencing the medium and process. Gersht and his small crew retraced the path taken by the German-Jewish writer and philosopher Walter Benjamin during his escape from Nazi occupied France in 1940. The same route was also used by the Emergency Rescue Committee established by American journalist Varian Fry to rescue many intellectuals, artists and political dissidents who were also fleeing the Nazis regime. Both in its harsh conditions and its tragic history, the route through the Pyrenees has come to symbolize a border between life and death itself, though with the creation of the European Union and its unified European market, the notion of what a border is and the Lister Route has changed significantly; the once guarded checkpoints are all but abandoned now. \r\n\r\nDespite the many references to the final journey taken by Walter Benjamin, the film does not attempt to re-enact his journey or portray Benjamin in a strictly historical or literal sense. Instead it is an open exploration of a primal struggle between a solitary individual and the elements. Thus the film is set in a nonspecific time, which could be thought of as no time or anytime.\r\n\r\nGersht states that the film is visually inspired by Paul Klee’s painting, Angelus Novus, that was referenced by Walter Benjamin in his final essay ‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’.\r\n \r\n….”an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. This storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while piles of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.” \r\n\r\n- Walter Benjamin, Illuminations,‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’, chapter IX, p-249 \r\n\r\nThis tragic image of an angel battling the elements, attempting to cross a border or, as suggested by Benjamin, to return to the past in a helpless desire to resurrect what has been smashed, is the core premise of the film.\r\n\r\nThe clear visual references to German Romanticism, particularly the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich, are suggestive of a fatal attachment to German culture that prevented Benjamin, like many others, from seeing clearly the terrible truth of the Nazi project until it was too late to escape its consequences. In the film the traveler is hopelessly moving through the romantic landscape attempting to free himself from the physical and cultural burdens that are imbedded in this sublime environment; preventing him from reaching a new horizon.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gersht, Ori"],"dc:date":"2009-09-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44028,"sim:weight":0.384453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99066,"sim:weight":0.383433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43485,"sim:weight":0.380911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46607,"sim:weight":0.380523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.364761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108237,"sim:weight":0.364669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98899,"sim:weight":0.364126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43177,"sim:weight":0.359627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48370,"sim:weight":0.358448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.357597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99288,"sim:weight":0.356773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43804,"sim:weight":0.356273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85495,"sim:weight":0.35343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43890,"sim:weight":0.352005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109172,"sim:weight":0.346186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.344087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48268,"sim:weight":0.340185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.336605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.336251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383589,"sim:weight":0.333187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Gersht traveled between cities that were affected by World War II as well as ancient locations in remote western Japan, examining the shifting symbolism of the cherry blossom. While initially associated with Buddhist concepts of renewal, the celebration of life, and good fortune, the cherry blossom was re-appropriated during Japan\u0027s 19th century militarization and colonial expansion. Once celebrated as a healthy and abundant flower, the falling of the petals from the tree became the symbol of Kamikaze soldiers. Gersht furthers this discussion of life and death symbolism in his exploration of trees planted before the war in unaffected remote areas, contrasting them against trees in Hiroshima that were planted in nuclear soil. \r\n\r\nThe artist made use of digital cameras that allowed for images to be taken under extreme light conditions, further questioning the ability of photography as a medium to convey a singular truth or story. Presenting documentation of what is assumed to be an exact location, Gershtʼs digital process allows for the absolute light and color veracity of these landscapes to be questioned and by extension the viewerʼs interpretation of this locationʼs history. Unlike previous series which focused on geographic journeys (Walter Benjamin following the Lister Route in Gershtʼs Evaders (2009) or The Forest (2006), in which the artistʼs family found refuge from Nazi persecution during WWII in the Ukraine), Falling Petals offers imagery that conveys past and present without a specified linear narrative; Gershtʼs photographic process implies the passage of time without providing an exacting start or finish to the life of the depicted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gersht, Ori"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.247929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.24755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46636,"sim:weight":0.245827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.244414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709961,"sim:weight":0.243243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43882,"sim:weight":0.243098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.239571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931320,"sim:weight":0.234099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.233242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84996,"sim:weight":0.2319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48370,"sim:weight":0.222484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.214784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43665,"sim:weight":0.214398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44028,"sim:weight":0.211422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44084,"sim:weight":0.21139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447847,"sim:weight":0.210475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43380,"sim:weight":0.210152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.207658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.207242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145840,"sim:weight":0.203781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

She moves backwards and forwards meditatively, drifting in and out of focus. Slowly she fades completely out of the dark scene as snow begins to drop from the sky; eventually the rhythmic falling of snow gives way to a virginal, white landscape, replacing the rhythmic rocking of her rocking chair. The woman in the film is Yeudith Arnon. A prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp, at the age of nineteen Arnon was ordered to dance at an SS officerʼs Christmas party. Upon refusal, her punishment was to stand barefoot in the snow all night. As a result, she resolved to dedicate herself to dance should she survive the camp. In 1962, she created the Kibbutzim Dance Company and became internationally renowned for her dancing and choreography. Now at the age of 85, she can no longer dance, but in the rocking chair, she is able to dance one more time. Will You Dance For Me is constructed of a specific, pre-existing personal narrative. The artist encourages the viewer to feel both the absence and presence of Arnonʼs dance within the cadence of her rocking chair. \r\n\r\nThe film was Produced in 2010-2011 in Israel and Ukraine, this film was produced in association with Photoworks, CRG Gallery; New York, Mummery \u0026 Schnelle Gallery; London, Angles Gallery; Los Angeles and Noga Gallery; Tel Aviv.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gersht, Ori"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

An intimate depiction of a matador dressing up for a fight is slowly unfolding on the centre screen, while the left and right screens remain dark. This ritualistic and ceremonial process reveals a very private and sensual portrait of a matador getting ready to face a bull while meditating on the inevitable fatal consequences of this encounter. When the preparations is completed the matador exits the room and the image of the empty room gradually fades away, while the left and right screens are lighting up with long panoramic pans which move from right to left across the three screens revealing large close up images of faces in the crowd watching the bull fight, the images are accompanied by a slow and highly charged musical score suggestive of the suspended tension that precede the final move of the matador leading to the killing of the bull. However the actual fight is excluded from the viewers of the film, and is only hinted through the facial expressions of the on looking crowd.  After a few minutes the panoramic portraits of the crowd fades away and a close up image of the matador who returned to his room to undress after the kill, appears on the centre screen. This sequence is much shorter than the dressing up, although, very charged and revealing. As the undressing completed, the matador is returning to his jeans white T-shirt as if returning from the mythological past into the mundane present. \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack that accompanies the film is a combination of late Renaissance, Spanish sacred music and selection of sounds that were recorded on location, during and around a bullfight and during the intimate preparations of the Matador. It is the sound that adds another layer establishing the interplay between presence and absence, between the witnessing and the imagination of the viewers.\r\n\r\nThe production was supported by:, Roundhouse, CRG Gallery; New York, Mummery \u0026 Schnelle Gallery; London, Angles Gallery; Los Angeles and Noga Gallery; Tel Aviv.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gersht, Ori"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447920,"sim:weight":0.247801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.241243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44390,"sim:weight":0.236384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44852,"sim:weight":0.22667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.222675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383083,"sim:weight":0.219147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46714,"sim:weight":0.218828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103424,"sim:weight":0.215114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.213733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45332,"sim:weight":0.212862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.212344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.206662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051962,"sim:weight":0.205928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643985,"sim:weight":0.202826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.2028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43485,"sim:weight":0.200981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.198892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.198801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382756,"sim:weight":0.197718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734401,"sim:weight":0.1974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here we explore this subject further with particular emphasis on the elements of visual attraction of illuminated surfaces as an early factor in the interaction process. Richard Appleby is an experienced industrial designer who has developed many consumer products where the surface definition and visual language has had a significant impact on the perceived values and tangibility of the product. These changing surface interactions should not be difficult or challenging, but intuitive and enjoyable to live with. The systems may be complex, but the way they reveal and offer their actions can heighten our awareness and sensitivity in new and unique ways. It is a question of subtlety and detail. As the surfaces we interact with have the intelligence to appreciate a much wider range of human conditions and user feedback, their response can be attuned more closely to our different senses and feelings, particularly as this leads to more subjective and sensorial types of interaction, with varying dimensions and magnitude. These surfaces change through colour and form that attract the user we\r\ncoin ‘tangible light interaction’. Particularly within the field of intelligent technologies, project examples show design concepts that support social interaction and remote communications in new ways.","bibo:AuthorList":["Appleby, Richard","Overbeeke, Kees (C.J.)"],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9033674,"sim:weight":0.459506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11127,"sim:weight":0.442647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59326,"sim:weight":0.441291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82151,"sim:weight":0.386704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.364368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795070,"sim:weight":0.345655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59347,"sim:weight":0.317056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.307638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186608,"sim:weight":0.301549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151791,"sim:weight":0.276929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151793,"sim:weight":0.273027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771698,"sim:weight":0.267461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99250,"sim:weight":0.263748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.262708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.262604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.260089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46580,"sim:weight":0.253812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.252326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.24701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.246701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Embodied interaction is a term originally coined by Paul Dourish (2001a) which refers to products, objects, conversations, actions etc. that unfold in the world and are meaningful in the social and physical world. We perceive the world in terms of what we can do with it, in terms of our skills, especially our perceptual-motor and social skills.

Students learn to integrate various approaches in the design process such as human, socio-cultural and technological aspects. Generating innovative concepts and original ideas are emphasized in the course. Taking into account recent developments in both the professional and educational field the Department of ID has based the course on an educational model in which competency development and self-directed learning are pivotal. The metaphor used for this model is ‘the student as a junior employee’. In the paper a comprehensive picture of the educational model is presented.

Led by the Visual Arts Data Service, a Research Centre at the University of the Creative Arts, the project consists of the seven partners: the Arts University College at Bournemouth, University of Brighton, the University of the Arts London, University College Falmouth and University of Southampton, and since its inception the project partners have been joined by two unfunded partners: the Royal School of Needlework and the Textile Archive, Bradford College.\r\n \r\nThe project has three primary objectives: to support the embedding of digitisation practice within partner institutions; to creative a community to share skills and expertise; and to share emerging knowledge with the wider higher education community through a series of case studies, practitioner guides and workshops. It was envisaged that this would be achieved in four stages. The first stage, project initiation, saw the partners examine the Knitting Collections held by the University of Southampton and consider a number of issues relating to the digitisation of the collections, including: image selection, copyright, metadata, funding, hosting options and user requirements. The second stage involved modelling the digitisation processes, identifying replication and inefficiencies in practice, as well as the critical success factors required to embed and sustain practice at an institutional and sectorial level. The third stage, application, involves partners applying and testing the digitisation model within their own institutions, this process would also enable the model to be reviewed and revised as appropriate, and enable partners to identify gaps in knowledge and skills within the sector. The final stage, dissemination, will see the emerging knowledge and practice shared across the wider higher education sector to support the digitisation of images within the predominately text based disciplines.\r\n \r\nAt the time of writing the project has been running for approximately six months and the partners have already held a series of workshops focusing on image selection, metadata and copyright, further sessions are planned for funding and commercialisation of collection, digitisation practices and sustainability. Community cohesion is high and all the partners are active both within the project and their host institutions sharing and embedding practice and identifying areas of common concern and ways forward.\r\n \r\nLonger term, the project is expected to have significant impact on both the partners and the wider higher education community. It will improve institutional capacity and effectiveness to digitise collections to support learning, teaching and research across the arts and, through the creation of the community of experts and the consultancy service, across the sector. Finally, the project will also raise awareness of the need and importance of digitisation processes within institutions and in the wider sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Garrett, Leigh"],"dc:date":"2010-10-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631027,"sim:weight":0.578903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631025,"sim:weight":0.552447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The repository has grown dramatically over the last twelve years, in excess of 120,000 items are now held on behalf of over three hundred collection holders.  Usage has also grown significantly, by 600% over the last five years, now 1.75 million images are viewed each month by repository users.\r\n\r\nIn September 2008, with funding from the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC), VADS started work on extending the impact and engagement of the repository in three key ways: developing mechanisms to share data with other repositories and online archives; improving the user experience of the collections; and increasing access to and usage of collections.  This paper will explore these three areas of work and their impact on usage of the image repository.  \r\n\r\nThe first key objective was to enhance the discoverability of the visual resources held by VADS.  This was accomplished by the introduction of an OAI-PMH service, with additional work planned on assessing the potential of OpenSearch and RSS technologies.  Although the image repository is widely used, it was felt that its reach could be both broadened and deepened.   The second key objective was to establish how the wider academic community currently engaged with the collections and more importantly what tools and services they wanted to see in future.  The research method centred on an online questionnaire of academic staff, both users and non-users of the image repository, this was supplemented by the follow up telephone interviews were appropriate.  Over 400 responses were received and the outcomes are due for publication in September 2009.  The last key objective involved increasing usage, although informed by the research programme this area has focused on services and tools which had been previously identified as essential to the development of the repository, this has included the development of a range of additional user-focused facilities such as user tagging; top level hierarchical subject taxonomy; and enhanced lightbox features.\r\n\r\nThe project is due for completion in September 2009 and outcomes and impact will be measured as part of the evaluation process, but early indications are positive.  The response from the sector has been enthusiastic and the release of the new tools and services are eagerly awaited, and promise to captivate and engage existing and new users.","bibo:AuthorList":["Garrett, Leigh","Robinson, Amy"],"dc:date":"2010-04-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631024,"sim:weight":0.552447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.253502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9023614,"sim:weight":0.177333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113848,"sim:weight":0.169187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15617,"sim:weight":0.16423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2737426,"sim:weight":0.162504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154328,"sim:weight":0.14863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.145861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771724,"sim:weight":0.140565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.140106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543344,"sim:weight":0.138054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6189655,"sim:weight":0.128636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.127969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.125729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193190,"sim:weight":0.122235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.122051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.120298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.120071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.113308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.10724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

His archive of prolific writings, diaries, photographs and extensive correspondence is an unrivalled source for research and study and is called on by scholars internationally. More recently, gifts have been made of new personal papers as well as the etching plates that Leach worked on between 1907-8 as a student and then in Japan until 1920.\r\n\r\nThese etching plates remind us that Leach began his career intending to be a fine artist. Whilst he produced etchings in Japan during his first creative steps, he remained committed to drawing throughout his life and his skill as a painter of pots remains one of his distinguishing attributes. This new exhibition brings together archives. etchings and drawings together with his early ceramics to present a rounded portrait of an eminent artist discovering a life-long interest in and aptitude for ceramics, set in the context of his first love of drawing.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition has been curated by Jean Vacher, Collections Manager of the Crafts Study Centre.\r\n\r\nMany of these etchings have rarely been seen in the museum environment, and the project, generously supported by the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation, is intended to stimulate a wider understanding of Leach\u0027s output as an etcher, and possibly to bring new etchings to light.

Its cognitive partner metonymy, however, has received significantly less attention.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses two fundamental elements of metonymy in thought: firstly its definition, and secondly its function in creativity.  It is a first foray into non-verbal metonymic creative thought, taken from an art practice perspective.  This viewpoint offers access to how metonymy functions in material processes, and how it draws meaning from proximal contexts.  With reference to cognitive linguistics, art philosophy and complexity theory, it uses case-study analysis and art practice to consider where and how meaning is held within processes, materials, objects, language and context, and the relationship between metonymy, metaphor, literality, alience and novelty.  It suggests a new, pragmatic definition of metonymy for use in non-verbal communication analysis, including visual art, sound art and music.  It finds that metonymy is a highly dynamic domain-internal process of meaning expansion, which uses proximity and adjacency to draw in meaning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ryland, Susan"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

India Shouting Match consists of pure shouting.  It is also an attempt to experiment with raw communication – the shouts of pre-civilisation.  They are no words, just emotions.  The work is perhaps the audio version of Jackson Pollock – an attempt to go beyond rationality and just experiment with the voice free of language and thought.  \r\n\r\nBarber has a long track record of working with the voice and language. This work connects well with Shouting Match and Gibberish, and others.  He has produced a substantial contribution to artists working with the voice and language.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndia Shouting Match is also part of a well-known series of Shouting Match video works that the artist regularly makes. Versions of Shouting Match have been shown as single screen works at Dundee Contemporary Arts, international film festivals and Miami Basel.  \r\n\r\nShouting Match is a conceptual work and has been staged in various places.  So far the artist has made four versions - in the UK, India, Israel and New Orleans, USA.  It can be shown as a multiscreen piece or each version makes a single screen work.\r\n\r\nImagine two seated people facing each other.  At the given signal they begin shouting.  They have to put everything into a short contest.  The harder they shout the more they are in the frame, the quieter they are, the more they are withdrawn.  If you fall silent – you will be out the frame.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShouting Match responds to the common situation in modern life whereby everything has to be turned ‘full up’.   Nothing is quiet.  Everything is exaggerated.  In effect, not saying anything very loudly - is an apt metaphor the modern world.  However, due to the variations in locations, each version is different, the cultural nuances are intriguing; in fact, not all shouting is the same.  \r\n\r\nShouting Match is made up of the actual vocal combat and insight into characters, how they behave, their faces in pain, anger, struggle, insanity, defeat and victory.  The sheer sound of the piece is impressive; especially as a multi-screen and consists of men and women using their voice in a totally irrational, pre-cultural fashion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barber, George"],"dc:date":"2009-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":113848,"sim:weight":0.295859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.219915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.216234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.209306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.209016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443360,"sim:weight":0.207749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445490,"sim:weight":0.207683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352164,"sim:weight":0.206302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382006,"sim:weight":0.199394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.195014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.194099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43801,"sim:weight":0.193659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.192594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.191667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710663,"sim:weight":0.188684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.187113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44852,"sim:weight":0.186973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381994,"sim:weight":0.185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18048,"sim:weight":0.182922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.181053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The adverts all relate to the ‘heart’ in some way, either through health or in the usual capitalistic fashion asking people to consume by appealing to their emotions.  A variety of adverts are used, ranging from the mobile campaigns, credit cards, bread, new DVDs, to ‘Fantastic Voyage’, the classic film about a miniature craft inserted into some poor soul’s blood stream.  Yet, as the piece intimates, following your heart does have consequences – it is not something we can always do – in shops or in life.  The messages start to collide and contradict. \r\n\r\nThe work has a contemporary ethos in that the artist’s position is almost one of hosting other people’s meanings or shared tv meanings and merely re-orchestrating them into a corrupted batch of communal stings.  The flow of visual pleasure and seduction is however still maintained.  In ‘Following Your Heart’, the artist’s raw material is already highly wrought and ‘produced’, leaving the way free to both enjoy the original, and yet step outside it.  \r\n\r\n‘Following Your Heart’ foregrounds the pleasure of the images but inverts their drive, recycling and placing commercial detritus into a more subjective realm, where one can sense the original intention but nevertheless enjoy it being flipped as a new orchestrated set of sounds, images and counter discourse.  Many of the adverts have been re-mixed to fit together perfectly, to be in tune and maintain the same timing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barber, George"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.229855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.224923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.219674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.218512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.213997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051961,"sim:weight":0.213031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.212489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.210915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.20926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.207982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.20439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.203508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383487,"sim:weight":0.199073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795073,"sim:weight":0.198655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.19788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44852,"sim:weight":0.197808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447850,"sim:weight":0.197187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445178,"sim:weight":0.196976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.195808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.193271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The catalyst was a television news item which was about the indescrimate slaughter of elephants simply for their ivory tusks. Apart from the obvious, and very relevant, considerations of suffering and conservation it was the ultimate irrationality of this barbaric act that engaged me to do the work, as I felt that as an artist I wanted to show my concern for the plight of the elephants. Why does ivory have such value and why do we allow the simple law of supply and demand- as applied not to basic essentials, but to conspicuous consumption, to exercise such a gross tyranny over our planet?\r\n\r\nThe work therefore challenges traditional notions, initially by evoking classicism, a form which utilised materials of both symbolic and intrinsic value which would age gracefully. This idea of long term appreciation and value is quite obviously alien, not only to the procurers and purveyors of ivory, but too much of contemporary culture. Ironically, the medium of television, which was responsible for disseminating the plight of the elephants, is also responsible for the dissemination of a great deal of information and entertainment which is arguably of dubious value. A television set which is not performing the function for which it was designed, is a peculiarly bereft and graceless object- the very epitome of vacuity- the detritus of culture. The body of an elephant slaughtered solely for possession of its tusks is the detritus of a supply created to meet the demand of a particular rarefied ostentatious and perverted refinement of taste.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heywood, Anthony"],"dc:date":"2004-11-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47210,"sim:weight":0.276236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176841,"sim:weight":0.253459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387221,"sim:weight":0.252004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.24843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.2479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.246842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051966,"sim:weight":0.244454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46605,"sim:weight":0.243326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.242127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.240538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771697,"sim:weight":0.240405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99288,"sim:weight":0.236088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382006,"sim:weight":0.233148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352197,"sim:weight":0.232601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.225805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.223717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.222889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.22273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.222152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.221065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A fragment of 20th Century black silk Chantilly lace embedded on metal disk, thinly coated with ionized gold particles is presented meticulously prepared for a Scanning Electron Microscopy imaging system. Conceived and displayed as a gold scientific relic, the fixed Chantilly lace sample represents the enduring material residue of the proceeding Black Lace film installation project. The work alludes to the procedural methods of the non-optical, dark space imaging process, the unusual characteristics of silk and the creative visualisation methods common to art and science.

{"identifier":9427945,"ep:Repository":117,"dc:type":["Art/Design Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Black Lace","bibo:abstract":"The Black Lace project alludes to the lurking fault lines between nature and culture and the work follows on from my wider research themes that also make cultural and artistic connections to the practices and narratives of contemporary biosciences.  The work breaks customary patterns of approaches to the material culture of lace, re-framing it as a complex biomaterial with bio-economic and bioethical dimensions.\r\n\r\n The fixed notion of “humanness’ has been subtly transformed by advancements in transgenic technologies and medicine but most of us are not able to realize the fullness, meaning and impact of current biosocial practices that reconfigure life. \r\n\r\nProduced as part of a major contemporary art and craft exhibition, Black Lace is a site-sensitive video and sound installation commissioned for the international lace textile exhibition, Lost in Lace, for the Birmingham City Art Gallery and Museum in 2011. Museum lace archive conservator support enabled an off-site destructive micro-visual analysis of silk lace from a unique sample of antique Chantilly lace. The donor sample is beautiful virtuoso piece of 20th century lace, bought from Steinman’s in Piccadilly London forming part of Lady Cadbury’s archive collection. Hundreds of hugely magnified studies were produced using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) in collaboration with Anton Page and David A Johnston, scientific imaging specialists from the Biomedical Imaging Unit, School of Medicine at the University of Southampton. Using complex, digital methods these were post produced and re-composed to create a continuous, slow panning shot of lace montages arranged along the Z axis in virtual 3D screen space. The resulting continuous scrolling lace landscape is set against a multilayered, stochastic sound composition of larval silk moths devouring the mulberry leaves that fuel the production of the silk protein fibers. \r\n\r\nThe decisive factor in using SEM was to visually evidence the underlying mathematics and structural torsions and twisting of Chantilly lace in close conjunction with the theoretically unfathomable and unimaginable complexity of the silk fibers. The human Chantilly net maker mimics polygonal networks found in nature but in the film, immensely magnified details reveal the lace’s intrinsic “otherness” and silkworm origins. The atoms, molecules and ecosystems deployed by the silk worms appear to operate like forces swelling out into shattered spirals. Each layered image in each scrolling scene of the film was technically drawn line by line by the deflections of a scanning electron beam operating in a vacuum. Each scene is intrinsically an image of lifelessness and the film is like a fossil.  Human vision involves the register of light in the retinal nervous system and brain. The non-optical electron materialization of the Chantilly net in the installation alludes to processes of biophysical metamorphosis and other lurking frontier narratives drawn from the contemporary biosciences and synthetic biology. In the biotech context, the chemical co-alliance of humans and the insect species is spectacular in its imagination but in many ways can be seen to follow on from the 5000-year scientific techniques of Sericulture industry in Asian countries. Sericulture refers to the production of silk from the larval cocoon of the silkworm Bombyx mori. The silkworm has biosocial significance and vast economies and whole communities depend on the molecular proteins of its cast off capillary structure. The industrial killing and utilization of the silkworm can make us lose sight of the intrinsic mystery around its morphological developmental stages from egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (cocoon) to adult moth and the fact that these intricate developmental mechanisms of metamorphosis are little understood by modern life science. Black Lace alludes to the lurking fault lines between nature and culture and the work follows on from my wider research themes that also make cultural and artistic connections to the practices and narratives of contemporary biosciences. The research outcomes represent a unique artistic, experimental approach to scientific imaging methods using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and fluorescing CLSM (Con-focal Laser Scanning Microscopy) building on paradoxical optical and quantum principles of image processing to forge a synthesis of hidden forms, wavelengths, signals and the instrumentation of matter. The project has resulted in transferable knowledge by extending the experimental use of non-optical microscopy as a “plastic” technical media for the production of art. The project extends the presentation of scientific imaging to encourage public engagement with the physics of non-optical bioimaging concepts and synthetic biology. The research engages in novel imaging production that extends the use of scientific imaging in the production of high-resolution HD video quality moving image display.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rogers, Kathleen"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.272269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.253702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.246259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.246098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.241952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051961,"sim:weight":0.241256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930866,"sim:weight":0.237489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.237245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.231663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.226456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.226456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.226456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.226456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.226456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.226456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.226456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.226456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.226456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.226456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.226456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, students of the visual arts are also required to complete numerous pieces of visual submissions for assessment, and yet very little similar work has been undertaken in the area of non-text based plagiarism detection. The Spot the Difference! project (2011-2012), funded by JISC and led by the University for the Creative Arts, seeks to address this gap by piloting the use of visual search tools developed by the University of Surrey and testing their application to support learning and teaching in the arts and specifically to the identification of visual plagiarism. Given that most commonly used search technologies rely on text, the identification and evidencing of visual plagiarism is often left to the knowledge and experience of academic staff, which can potentially result in inconsistency of detection, approach, policies and practices. This paper outlines the work of the project team, who sought to investigate the nature, scope and extent of visual plagiarism in the arts education sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Garrett, Leigh","Robinson, Amy"],"dc:date":"2012-07-10","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2010).

The preservation and publication of research data is seen as positive and all UK Research Councils now require it as a condition of funding (RCUK 2012). As a result a network of data repositories are emerging (DataCite 2012a), some funded by Research Councils, others by institutions themselves. However, research data management practice within the visual arts appears ad hoc. None of the specialist arts institutions within the UK has implemented research data management policies (DCC 2011a), nor established research data management systems. KAPTUR seeks to investigate the nature of visual arts research data, making recommendations for its effective management; develop a model of best practice applicable to both specialist arts institutions and arts departments in multidisciplinary institutions; and apply, test and refine the model with the four institutional partners. This paper will explore the nature of visual arts research data and how effective data management can ensure its long term usage, curation and preservation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Garrett, Leigh","Gramstadt, Marie-Therese"],"dc:date":"2012-07-10","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2012).

{"identifier":9427962,"ep:Repository":117,"dc:type":["Art/Design Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Mindful thing´s","bibo:abstract":"This new series of works by Andrea Gregson is an assortment of objects constructed from found and acquired, often broken, man-made items as well as material from nature.  The individual elements in these sculptures have been collected by Gregson over a protracted period and are linked together by the journey through her life.  Reconfigured in this new body of work the many separate parts form a new cohesive whole.  Using the found objects as well as casting them in different materials, Gregson reinvents them as sculptural assemblage.\r\nWithin the display cabinet is a series of sculptures bringing together found items and components cast in bronze. The works are composed from parts of food and cosmetic containers and rocks found on walks along the Thames embankment as well as other locations. There is a distinct play between the moulded forms, where the original material has lost its specific character; the organic, raw state of the stone and rock constituents and the pieces that are remnants from modern-day life.\r\n\r\nOn the wall opposite, concrete sculptures disrupt the wall as evolving shapes emerge from the surface.  A transformation from visceral material to tangible form takes place, one that is reminiscent of the intermediary stages between liquid to solid states. Another series of sculptures are placed on the tables in Concrete Café, offering the invitation to be handled.  Ornamental in scale, these plaster objects are oddities with a debatable purpose.\r\nThe making of some of this new work was inspired by Gregson’s recent encounter at Camber Sands with WW2 Bunkers that were cast in-situ on the beach.

A secondary aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of a structured approach to establishing such mappings.\r\n\r\nThe project was carried out over 2006, from January to December, by the visual arts centre of the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS Visual Arts).1 It was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) as one of the Strategy Projects run under the aegis of its ICT in Arts and Humanities Research programme. The programme, which runs from October 2003 until September 2008, aims ‘to develop, promote and monitor the AHRC’s ICT strategy, and to build capacity nation-wide in the use of ICT for arts and humanities research’.2 As part of this, the Strategy Projects were intended to contribute to the programme in two ways: knowledge-gathering projects would inform the programme’s Fundamental Strategic Review of ICT, conducted for the AHRC in the second half of 2006, focusing ‘on critical strategic issues such as e-science and peer-review of digital resources’. Resource-development projects would ‘build tools and resources of broad relevance across the range of the AHRC’s academic subject disciplines’.3 This project fell into the knowledge-gathering strand.\r\n\r\nThe project ran under the leadership of Dr Mike Pringle, Director, AHDS Visual Arts, and the day-to-day management of Polly Christie, Projects Manager, AHDS Visual Arts.

Utilising the findings of the KAPTUR user requirement and technical review this paper will outline the method and selection of an appropriate research data management system for the visual arts and the issues the team encountered along the way.","bibo:AuthorList":["Garrett, Leigh","Gramstadt, Marie-Therese","Silva, Carlos"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9427955,"sim:weight":0.724673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631047,"sim:weight":0.504219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9322815,"sim:weight":0.419658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495139,"sim:weight":0.379729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931120,"sim:weight":0.379101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.303601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99840,"sim:weight":0.273637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15592,"sim:weight":0.269705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.263217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Technical Manager selected 17 systems to compare with the user requirement document (Appendix B). Five of the systems had similar scores so these were short-listed. The Technical Manager created an online form into which the Project Officers entered priority scores for each of the user requirements in order to calculate a more accurate score for each of the five short-listed systems (Appendix C) and this resulted in the choice of EPrints as the software for the KAPTUR project.","bibo:AuthorList":["Garrett, Leigh","Silva, Carlos","Gramstadt, Marie-Therese"],"dc:date":"2012-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"arXiv.

Utilising drawing, sculpture and socially engaged practice, the works become potential projects growing out of the ruins of the current economic collapse. As banks, construction, manufacturing, art market and business decline, recession catapults us into a state of flux. The works become projects that deviate from profit and targets and are like small flickers of resistance. They evolve from this moment of chaos and could be both an antidote and irritant. The show places work within the narrative of a’workshop’, as a place in which experiments can be made and where utopian ideas can be realised, igniting our re-invention. In this context, the works themselves are in different stages of formation and include abandoned proposals and prototypes made potent now with their content, raw half formed experiments with enormous potential, to more resolved ideas. True to the notion of theworkshop as a narrative, Fine Art and Science students have been invited to make models and diagrams with the curator,these individual pieces are presented as a sprawling multiple artwork. The playful use of scale challenges the viewers perception, lingering as they do between actuality and fantasy, and touching upon new ideas to redefine the material world in this time.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gregson, Andrea"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1652929,"sim:weight":0.320037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443345,"sim:weight":0.319417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340778,"sim:weight":0.298344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103460,"sim:weight":0.295896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051969,"sim:weight":0.292101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051960,"sim:weight":0.286278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.283341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.28013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6204223,"sim:weight":0.277295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225608,"sim:weight":0.275626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.274249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447708,"sim:weight":0.264907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733952,"sim:weight":0.26159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103424,"sim:weight":0.26116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103251,"sim:weight":0.257094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443360,"sim:weight":0.256366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445490,"sim:weight":0.256201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.251074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.24982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.249604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
