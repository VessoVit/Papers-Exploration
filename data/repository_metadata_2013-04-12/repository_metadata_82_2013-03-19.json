The friction damper is semi-active: damping is controlled without energy introduction into the system and hence the power required is much smaller than fully active systems. Models for the friction damper hydraulic drive and vehicle ride are developed. It is shown through simulation and experimental studies that a VSC-controlled friction damper has potentially superior performance to a conventional damper. Limitations of the current design are identified and suggestions for improvements are outlined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edge, Kevin A","Guglielmino, E"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26753,"sim:weight":0.549658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.427955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59004,"sim:weight":0.424856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":767606,"sim:weight":0.391521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57236,"sim:weight":0.383167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86116,"sim:weight":0.344893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60322,"sim:weight":0.324973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.30254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.299991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108820,"sim:weight":0.274739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.270523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734349,"sim:weight":0.266433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.254335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334172,"sim:weight":0.134677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Our analysis is designed to apply to the case when A is large and sparse and where iterative methods are used to solve the shifted linear systems (A − σI)y \u003d x which arise. We present a convergence theory that is independent of the nature of the inexact solver used, and, though the use of the Rayleigh quotient is emphasised, our analysis also extends to quite general choices for shift and inexact solver strategies. Additionally, the convergence framework allows us to treat both standard preconditioning and to present a new analysis of the variation introduced by Simoncini and Eldén (BIT, vol. 42, pp.159–182, 2002). Also, we provide an analysis of the performance of inner iteration solves when preconditioned MINRES is used as the inexact solver. This analysis provides descriptive bounds which are shown to predict well the actual behaviour observed in practice. Also, it explains the improvement in performance of the modification introduced by Simoncini and Eldén over the standard preconditioned form. Importantly, our analysis shows that letting the shift tend to the eigenvalue, as is the case if the Rayleigh quotient is used, does not harm significantly the performance of the iterative method for the shifted systems.

This calculation involves the solution of a Hermitian nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Numerical methods for nonlinear eigenvalue problems are usually based on Newton’s method or are extensions of techniques for the standard eigenvalue problem. We present a new variation on existing methods which has its derivation in methods for bifurcation problems, where bordered matrices are used to compute critical points in singular systems. This new approach has several advantages over the current methods. First, in our numerical calculations the new variation is more robust than existing techniques, having a larger domain of convergence. Second, the linear systems remain Hermitian and are nonsingular as the method converges. Third, the approach provides an elegant and efficient way of both thinking about the problem and organising the computer solution so that only one linear system needs to be factorised at each stage in the solution process. Finally, first- and higher-order derivatives are calculated as a natural extension of the basic method, and this has advantages in the electromagnetic problem discussed here, where the band structure is plotted as a set of paths in the (ω,k) plane.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spence, A","Poulton, C"],"dc:date":"2005-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1573416,"sim:weight":0.45302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2812454,"sim:weight":0.448231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109162,"sim:weight":0.397998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23197,"sim:weight":0.394931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.383772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.364644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85751,"sim:weight":0.344737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75571,"sim:weight":0.255142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8792732,"sim:weight":0.182446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334577,"sim:weight":0.157055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8044,"sim:weight":0.154785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The criteria for a reliable culture system include the ability to perform real time observations and manipulations in vitro, the preparation of wholemounts for immunostaining and the potential for introducing genes.\n\nResults:  The new culture system involves growing mouse embryo intestinal explants on fibronectin-coated coverslips in basal Eagle\u0027s medium+20% fetal bovine serum. Initially the cultures maintain expression of the intestinal transcription factor Cdx2 together with columnar epithelial (cytokeratin 8) and mesenchymal (smooth muscle actin) markers. Over a few days of culture, differentiation markers appear characteristic of absorptive epithelium (sucrase-isomaltase), goblet cells (Periodic Acid Schiff positive), enteroendocrine cells (chromogranin A) and Paneth cells (lysozyme).\n\nThree different approaches were tested to express genes in the developing cultures: transfection, electroporation and adenoviral infection. All could introduce genes into the mesenchyme, but only to a small extent into the epithelium.\n\nHowever the efficiency of adenovirus infection can be greatly improved by a limited enzyme digestion, which makes accessible the lateral faces of cells bearing the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor. This enables reliable delivery of genes into epithelial cells.\n\nConclusion:  We describe a new in vitro culture system for the small intestine of the mouse embryo that recapitulates its normal development. The system both provides a model for studying normal development of the intestinal epithelium and also allows for the manipulation of gene expression. The explants can be cultured for up to two weeks, they form the full repertoire of intestinal epithelial cell types (enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells) and the method for gene introduction into the epithelium is efficient and reliable.","bibo:AuthorList":["Quinlan, J","Yu, W-Y","Hornsey, M","Tosh, D","Slack, JMW"],"dc:date":"2006-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.322631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.317555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.283474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.277073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.239077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Some groups – unemployed people, lone parents, large families, people with disabilities, and some ethnic groups – have much higher poverty rates than average. Some events – losing a job, marital breakdown, having children – also put people at high risk of poverty. But being in a high-risk group does not necessarily mean you will be poor, nor does experiencing an event with a high poverty risk attached to it. Some people avoid poverty, despite being in high-risk groups or facing high-risk events. This article focuses on one such group – low-paid workers – and explores whether and how people in low-paid jobs are able to avoid poverty. We consider three main options – own wages and in particular working long hours, living with other people and sharing income, and state transfers through the tax and benefit system – and compare these across different family and household types. The results highlight the importance of household living arrangements in protecting low-waged individuals against poverty.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gardiner, K","Millar, Jane"],"dc:date":"2006-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As auditor tenure increases, the auditor\u0027s ability to detect fraud increases, which reduces the manager\u0027s fraud-incentives, but the auditor may become more sympathetic to management, which may increase fraud incentives.  In order to analyse these issues, we develop an auditing game in which the manager makes an unobservable decision whether or not to commit fraud.  The auditor then decides whether to perform a basic or an extended audit.  The level of audit affects the probability of fraud-detection.  Following the outcome of the audit, the auditor then decides whether to issue a qualified or unqualified report.

We consider two cases. In the\nfirst case, the manager may have an incentive to exert an inefficiently low level of effort in running the business (‘managerial shirking’). The manager may issue high debt as a commitment device (the increase in expected financial distress drives him to a higher effort level). An overconfident manager overestimates his ability, and underestimates financial distress costs. Therefore, our first model predicts a positive relationship between overconfidence and debt. However, the effect of overconfidence on firm value is ambiguous, and depends which factor (the positive effect of higher effort, or the negative effect of higher debt and higher expected financial distress)\ndominates. In the second case, the manager has an incentive to use free cash flow to\ninvest in a new pet project that may be value-reducing (the free cash flow problem).\nIn contrast to the first case, overconfidence may result in a decrease in debt (the rational manager knows that the new project is value-reducing and uses high debt to commit not to invest in it, while the overconfident manager perceives the new project as value-increasing, and reduces debt in order to make the investment). Again, the effect of overconfidence on firm value is ambiguous, since a project that may have been value-reducing under a rational manager may indeed be value-increasing under\nan overconfident manager, as the overconfident manager exerts higher effort. We conclude our analysis by conceptualising a model of “excessive life-cycle debt\nsensitivity due to managerial overconfidence” not previously explored in the literature.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fairchild, R"],"dc:date":"2007-12-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91276,"sim:weight":0.243267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98929,"sim:weight":0.242515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.236899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316064,"sim:weight":0.233144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.225912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1057383,"sim:weight":0.219415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382092,"sim:weight":0.200361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.198907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90187,"sim:weight":0.180633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.154782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.154782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48274,"sim:weight":0.149699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573403,"sim:weight":0.139406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.108141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

During a short initial phase, iontophoresis extracts the lactate present in the skin reservoir, providing information of relevance, perhaps, for dermatological and cosmetic applications. In a second step, lactate is extracted from the interstitial subdermal fluid allowing local lactate kinetics to be followed in a completely non-invasive way.

This approach leads to an inner-outer type algorithm. We provide convergence results for the outer iterative eigenvalue computation as well as techniques for efficient inner solves. In particular eigenvalue computations using inexact inverse iteration, the Jacobi-Davidson method without subspace expansion and the shift-invert Arnoldi method as a subspace method are investigated in detail.\r\n\r\nA general convergence result for inexact inverse iteration for the non-Hermitian generalised eigenvalue problem is given, using only minimal assumptions. This convergence result is obtained in two different ways; on the one hand, we use an equivalence result between inexact inverse iteration applied to the generalised eigenproblem and modified Newton\u0027s method; on the other hand, a splitting method is used which generalises the idea of orthogonal decomposition. Both approaches also include an analysis for the convergence theory of a version of inexact Jacobi-Davidson method, where equivalences between Newton\u0027s method, inverse iteration and the Jacobi-Davidson method are exploited. \r\n\r\nTo improve the efficiency of the inner iterative solves we introduce a new tuning strategy which can be applied to any standard preconditioner. We give a detailed analysis on this new preconditioning idea and show how the number of iterations for the inner iterative method and hence the total number of iterations can be reduced significantly by the application of this tuning strategy. The analysis of the tuned preconditioner is carried out for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian eigenproblems. We show how the preconditioner can be implemented efficiently and illustrate its performance using various numerical examples. An equivalence result between the preconditioned simplified Jacobi-Davidson method and inexact inverse iteration with the tuned preconditioner is given. \r\n\r\nFinally, we discuss the shift-invert Arnoldi method both in the standard and restarted fashion. First, existing relaxation strategies for the outer iterative solves are extended to implicitly restarted Arnoldi\u0027s method. Second, we apply the idea of tuning the preconditioner to the inner iterative solve. As for inexact inverse iteration the tuned preconditioner for inexact Arnoldi\u0027s method is shown to provide significant savings in the number of inner solves. \r\n\r\nThe theory in this thesis is supported by many numerical examples.","bibo:AuthorList":["Freitag, Melina"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1573383,"sim:weight":0.81336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573377,"sim:weight":0.678402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573382,"sim:weight":0.633017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633549,"sim:weight":0.50256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633887,"sim:weight":0.496355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97303,"sim:weight":0.493623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633642,"sim:weight":0.486808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5850065,"sim:weight":0.475628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46188,"sim:weight":0.465321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2811856,"sim:weight":0.458837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573378,"sim:weight":0.45302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9321468,"sim:weight":0.434769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999515,"sim:weight":0.428407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633578,"sim:weight":0.427042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633667,"sim:weight":0.423651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16055,"sim:weight":0.415997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633599,"sim:weight":0.412928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634020,"sim:weight":0.412311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633859,"sim:weight":0.395443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1593410,"sim:weight":0.393286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Lime mortars harden through carbonation, and this thesis is a study of that process.\r\nThe research conducted has resulted in the development of two novel techniques for the measurement and detection of carbonation. The first technique is a method of thermogravimetric analysis which allows the carbonation profile to be measured within an acceptable time-frame. The second technique is the use of drilling resistance measurement to visualise the carbonation profile. The potential of elemental analysis to measure the carbonation profile has also been identified.\r\nIt has been demonstrated that the lime/water ratio has less impact on the compressive strength of air lime mortars than had previously been supposed. \r\nThe change in the pore size distribution of air lime mortars caused by carbonation has been studied, and a theory has been proposed to explain this phenomenon.\r\nFive different forms of air lime binder were studied. The impact of these on the structural performance of the resultant mortars has been assessed. It was concluded that mortars made with lime putties perform better than mortars made with dry lime hydrate. Mortars made with dispersed hydrated lime appear to perform as well as mortars made with lime putties, but at a slower rate of strength growth. The use of extra mature lime putty does not appear to confer structural performance benefits when compared with ordinary lime putty.\r\nIt has been shown that the use of calcitic aggregates can produce air lime mortars which perform as well as moderately hydraulic lime mortars. It is theorised that this phenomenon is not directly related to carbonation, but rather to a complex interaction of the granulometry, mineralogy, chemistry and porosity of the aggregate with the binder.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lawrence, Robert"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":57499,"sim:weight":0.578222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57497,"sim:weight":0.570557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223536,"sim:weight":0.524698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43528,"sim:weight":0.476759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43876,"sim:weight":0.466419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316479,"sim:weight":0.463793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":489080,"sim:weight":0.426789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146045,"sim:weight":0.40417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":873474,"sim:weight":0.403989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5714179,"sim:weight":0.402277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1091791,"sim:weight":0.361124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":861801,"sim:weight":0.349601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107173,"sim:weight":0.348666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5837985,"sim:weight":0.337464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2673604,"sim:weight":0.3372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":793508,"sim:weight":0.334499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5689948,"sim:weight":0.332265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2810804,"sim:weight":0.329172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5851753,"sim:weight":0.317028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":839772,"sim:weight":0.316947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, correctly specifying the behaviour of such\r\nsystems is a difficult problem. Designers are faced with two concurrent, complex tasks:\r\nfirstly they must specify the relationships (over time) between agents’ actions and their\r\neffects, and secondly they must also consider how agents’ actions are to be regulated\r\nthrough the definition of agents’ permissions and obligations. Such systems are typi-\r\ncally complex, and given this complexity it may be difficult for a designer to determine\r\nwhether their original objectives have been captured by the specification of the system.\r\nIn this dissertation we seek to address some of the problems associated with institu-\r\ntional specification. In order to do this we present a model for specifying institutions\r\nbased on the notion of socially constructed reality that accounts not only for how the\r\naction and events which constitute the institution are described, but also how they are\r\nregulated. Institutions may be used in a number of ways, and may account for concepts\r\nat varying levels of abstraction. Recognising this we also investigate how several insti-\r\ntutions, each accounting for a particular aspect of a society may be composed and how\r\nthe relationships between these institutions may be expressed. Given this model, we\r\nthen demonstrate how, using the answer set programming paradigm institutional spec-\r\nifications based on our model may be checked for the absence or presence of certain\r\n(un)desirable properties.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cliffe, Owen"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98829,"sim:weight":0.612597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9552805,"sim:weight":0.524321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.510774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934368,"sim:weight":0.498184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9015736,"sim:weight":0.498178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998027,"sim:weight":0.485954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77020,"sim:weight":0.47924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998255,"sim:weight":0.473098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933897,"sim:weight":0.465311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826710,"sim:weight":0.465261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934200,"sim:weight":0.461546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930596,"sim:weight":0.45875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997844,"sim:weight":0.455358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932683,"sim:weight":0.45503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98176,"sim:weight":0.451487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1003884,"sim:weight":0.450531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1440873,"sim:weight":0.449227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998424,"sim:weight":0.448814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998348,"sim:weight":0.445677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998427,"sim:weight":0.444449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For advisory services, the goal is to achieve the best solution for any individual  institution\u0027s needs, balancing its enthusiasm with its own internal constraints and long term commitments. For example, open\nstandards are a genuine good, but they may fail to gain market acceptance. Rushing headlong to standardize on open standards may not be the best approach. Instead a healthy dose of pragmatism is required. Similarly, open source software is an excellent choice when it best meets the needs of an institution, but not perhaps without\nreference to those needs. Providing open access to data owned by museums sounds like the right thing to do, but progress towards open access needs to also consider the sustainability plan for the service. Regrettably institutional policies and practices may not be in step with the possibilities that present themselves. Often a period of reflection on the implications of such activity is what is needed. Advisory services can help to provide this reflective moment. UKOLN, for example, has developed of a Quality Assurance (QA) model for making use\nof open standards. Originally developed to support the Joint Information Systems Committee’s (JISC) digital library development programmes, it has subsequently been extended across other programmes areas. Another example is provided by OSS Watch’s contribution to the development of JISC’s own policy on open source software for its projects and services. The JISC policy does not mandate the use of open source, but instead guides development projects through a series of steps dealing with IPR issues, code management, and community development, which serve to enhance any JISC-funded project that takes up an open source development methodology. CETIS has provided a range of services to support community awareness and\ncapability to make effective decisions about open standards in e-learning, and has informed the JISC policy and practices in relation to open standards in e-learning development. Again, rather than a mandate, the policy requires development projects to become involved in a community of practice relevant to their domain where there is a contextualised understanding of open standards.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kelly, B","Wilson, S","Metcalfe, R"],"dc:date":"2007-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.467373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2809459,"sim:weight":0.441618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2808955,"sim:weight":0.384627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334253,"sim:weight":0.352402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2808954,"sim:weight":0.341331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2804865,"sim:weight":0.235802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2809458,"sim:weight":0.198305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2809620,"sim:weight":0.162354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Important aspects of flow control include flow separation, vortex formation, flow reattachment, vortex breakdown, and vortex instabilities. The occurrence and relative importance of these phenomena strongly depend on the wing sweep angle. Various flow control methods were discussed: multiple vortices, control surfaces, blowing and suction, low-frequency and high-frequency excitation, feedback control, passive control with wing flexibility, and plasma actuators. For slender delta wings, control of vortex breakdown is achieved by modifications to swirl level and external pressure gradient acting on the vortex core. Effects of flow control methods on these two parameters were discussed, and their effectiveness was compared whenever possible. With the high-frequency excitation of the separated shear layer, reattachment and lift enhancement in the post-stall region is observed, which is orders of magnitude more effective than steady blowing. This effect is more pronounced for nonslender wings. Re-formation of vortices is possible with sufficient amplitude of forcing at the optimum frequency. Passive lift enhancement on flexible wings is due to the self-excited wing vibrations, which occur when the frequency of wing vibrations is close to the frequency of the shear layer instabilities, and promote flow  reattachment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gursul, I","Wang, Z","Vardaki, E"],"dc:date":"2007-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1573429,"sim:weight":0.849511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2803683,"sim:weight":0.701784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2805727,"sim:weight":0.557592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8795269,"sim:weight":0.522692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29316,"sim:weight":0.406469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26771,"sim:weight":0.378734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28174,"sim:weight":0.378465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2810555,"sim:weight":0.377064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.363689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268054,"sim:weight":0.324903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28173,"sim:weight":0.30768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24687,"sim:weight":0.297054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26768,"sim:weight":0.291611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108393,"sim:weight":0.290387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2813353,"sim:weight":0.28753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":990841,"sim:weight":0.269949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26766,"sim:weight":0.267936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26015,"sim:weight":0.254186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.245119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9563,"sim:weight":0.223838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Vortical flows develop at very low angles of attack, and form close to the wing surface. This results in strong interactions with the upper-surface boundary layer and in a pronounced dependence of the flow structure on Reynolds number. Vortex breakdown is observed to be much less abrupt compared to breakdown over slender wings. This results in challenges for the precise determination of vortex breakdown location and the interpretation of flow visualizations. One of the distinct features of nonslender wings is the location of the primary attachment zone outboard of the symmetry plane. Reattachment location correlates with the wing stall process and increased buffeting. Dramatic fluid/structure interactions emerge with increasing wing flexibility and result in substantial lift enhancement in the post-stall region. This recently discovered phenomenon appears to be a feature of nonslender wings. Rigid delta wings undergoing small amplitude oscillations in the post-stall region exhibit many similarities to flexible wings, including reattachment and re-formation of the leading-edge vortices.

Using specific antagonists for NR2A [(R)-[(S)-1-(4-bromo-phenyl)-ethylamino]-(2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-5-yl)-methyl]-phosphonic acid] and NR2B [(αR,ßS)-α-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ß -methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol hydrochloride (Ro 25-6981)] subunit-containing receptors, we confirmed that in slices from juvenile rats (4–6 weeks of age), the autoreceptor is predominantly of the NR1–NR2B subtype. In older (4–6 months of age) control animals, the effect of the NR2B antagonist was less marked, suggesting a decline in autoreceptor function with development.

These results suggest that there is a developmental decrease in NMDA autoreceptor function, which is reversed in a chronic epileptic condition. The enhanced autoreceptor function may contribute to seizure susceptibility and epileptogenesis in temporal lobe structures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yang, J","Woodhall, GL","Jones, RSG"],"dc:date":"2006-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":113355,"sim:weight":0.287694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2812029,"sim:weight":0.217961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is an important enzyme of the folate cycle; inhibition of DHFR inhibits growth and causes cell death. The crystal structure of M. tuberculosis DHFR revealed a glycerol tightly bound close to the binding site for the substrate dihydrofolate; this glycerol-binding motif is absent from the human enzyme. A series of pyrimidine-2,4-diamines was designed with a two-carbon tether between a glycerol-mimicking triol and the 6-position of the heterocycle; these compounds also carried aryl substituents at the 5-position. These, their diastereoisomers, analogues lacking two hydroxy groups and analogues lacking the two-carbon spacing linker were synthesised by acylation of the anions derived from phenylacetonitriles with ethyl (4S,5R)-4-benzyloxymethyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-propanoate, ethyl (4S,5S)-4-benzyloxymethyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-propanoate, tetrahydrooxepin-2-one and 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-erythronolactone, respectively, to give the corresponding α-acylphenylacetonitriles. Formation of the methyl enol ethers, condensation with guanidine and deprotection gave the pyrimidine-2,4-diamines. Preliminary assay of the abilities of these compounds to inhibit the growth of TB5 Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying the DHFR genes from M. tuberculosis, human and yeast indicated that 5-phenyl-6-((3R,4S)-3,4,5-trihydroxypentyl)pyrimidine-2,4-diamine selectively inhibited M. tuberculosis DHFR and had little effect on the human or yeast enzymes.","bibo:AuthorList":["El-Hamamsy, M H R I","Smith, A W","Thompson, A S","Threadgill, M D"],"dc:date":"2007-07-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1573426,"sim:weight":0.654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99125,"sim:weight":0.491845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56462,"sim:weight":0.439051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767707,"sim:weight":0.38081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145957,"sim:weight":0.324204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98648,"sim:weight":0.296759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145744,"sim:weight":0.288166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387352,"sim:weight":0.27545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761099,"sim:weight":0.256594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98788,"sim:weight":0.245645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77812,"sim:weight":0.245332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654166,"sim:weight":0.239266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145301,"sim:weight":0.23139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43264,"sim:weight":0.22971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75663,"sim:weight":0.227222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98516,"sim:weight":0.218691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664588,"sim:weight":0.213259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98550,"sim:weight":0.208072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631551,"sim:weight":0.202962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98781,"sim:weight":0.178802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Seventy graduates and undergraduates contributed their perceptions of the learning opportunities they encountered while studying Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Bath, between 1994 and 2005. The methodology employed was qualitative, involving open dialogue (face to face and by email) whereby the students’ concerns dictated the agenda, rather than those of the researcher. Data are presented in narrative form, intended to convey a rounded picture of the richness and variety of students\u0027 perceptions of their learning situations, including lectures, practical classes, tutorials, placements, presentations and projects. Preliminary research suggested that learning from professional work placements can be significant, even ‘special’, and placement learning was the initial focus of the project. Research questions crystallised in the following areas: ‘What is the nature of placement learning?’, ‘How does it come about?’ and ‘How does it compare with learning from university-based learning opportunities?’ Preliminary data suggested that undergraduate learning could best be understood through socio-cultural and activity theories of learning (SCAT.Vygotsky, Leontiev and others) but this did not explain the disparity which can occur between intended learning outcomes, envisaged by the University, and the learning which students actually reported. Data from the four year longitudinal study was, therefore, analysed using a framework which was a fusion between SCAT and Theories of Action (comparison between espoused theories and theories in use. Argyris and Schön).

The production function for final output is of the AK – type, which uses aggregate capital as single input. Aggregate capital is represented by a Cobb-Douglas index comprising three types capital. Human capital accumulation results from productive consumption and an increase in social capital is driven by the existence of human capital.

The excitation of electron-hole pairs is an inherently non-adiabatic process which is often ignored\r\nin standard theoretical treatments of surface phenomena, using tools such as density functional theory (DFT), as the Born-Oppenheimer  approximation cannot be used. To obtain a theoretical model for the electronic excitation process it is therefore necessary to go beyond conventional methods. Previous theoretical\r\ndescriptions have used a nearly-adiabatic approximation to describe electronic excitations.\r\nHowever, these methods have been found to fail in situations where an adsorbing atom undergoes a transition between a spin-polarised and unpolarised state.\r\nIn this thesis we develop a fully non-adiabatic theory using a simple description\r\nof the adsorbate-metal interaction; the time-dependent, mean-field Newns-\r\nAnderson model. This model describes a simple electronic system in which a\r\nband of metal states interacts with a single atomic orbital, which can undergo a\r\n‘spin-transition’. We derive expressions describing the time-dependent transfer\r\nof charge and energy between the adsorbate and surface, as well as the spectrum\r\nof electronic excitations generated.

The intention is to analyze how indirect tax reform\nreflects the policy objectives particularly in the light of equity and\ndistributional considerations envisaged in the tax reform strategy. Whilst one\naim is to reflect on the aggregate indirect tax incidence overtime at the\nnational as well as the urban/rural level, the second objective is to provide a\nhigh level of disaggregation of incidence picture in order to explore the\nsensitivity of tax incidence in terms of key commodities. Additionally, this\nstudy attempts to illustrate the sensitivity of estimated tax incidence results to\nthe assumption of zero demand responses and to identify welfare enhancing\ndirections of tax reform for Pakistan at the margin by using the marginal\ntheory of tax reform.\n\nThe findings of this study seem to indicate that a move from dependence on\ntrade tax revenues to GST/VAT revenues for Pakistan has made the overall\nindirect tax system a little more progressive. It appears post- reform indirect\ntax incidence is sensitive to taxation of key commodities including sugar,\nedible oils and basic fuel/utilities. Incidentally, taxation of these commodities\nalso appears to have strong distributional effects on the poor. Whilst exploring\nthe sensitivity of estimated tax incidence results to the incorporation of\nbehaviour responses, our estimated results do not appear to be very sensitive\nto this incorporation. Furthermore, directions of welfare enhancing tax reform\n(at the margin) for Pakistan reveal that a reduction in the price of basic food\n(including beef, wheat, milk and pulses) should be welfare enhancing; taxation\nof sugar maybe efficient but not equitable, while only taxation of vegetable\nghee simultaneously fits both criterion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Refaqat, S"],"dc:date":"2008-05-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108375,"sim:weight":0.647218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17025,"sim:weight":0.641666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98916,"sim:weight":0.60803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101286,"sim:weight":0.579113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26175,"sim:weight":0.572309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1028096,"sim:weight":0.570411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93289,"sim:weight":0.537302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89543,"sim:weight":0.488973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":202102,"sim:weight":0.483966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":917055,"sim:weight":0.468948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":892540,"sim:weight":0.46424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76504,"sim:weight":0.45889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154083,"sim:weight":0.442244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.413994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1017139,"sim:weight":0.380898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17029,"sim:weight":0.357805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":892529,"sim:weight":0.357779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.353855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.353855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2807615,"sim:weight":0.345817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Our approach gives a highly stylised look to images without the support of 3D models, and yet they still behave as though animated by drawing, which they are.\r\nFirst, a stylised brush tool is used to freely draw extreme poses of characters.\r\nEach character is built up of 2D drawn brush strokes which are manually grouped\r\ninto layers. Each layer is assigned its place in a drawing hierarchy called a Hierarchical\r\nDisplay Model (HDM). Next, multiple HDMs are created for the same character, each corresponding to a specific view. A collection of HDMs essentially\r\nreintroduces some correspondence information to the 2D drawings needed for inbetweening\r\nand, in effect, eliminates the need for a true 3D model.\r\nOnce the models are composed the animator starts by defining keyframes from\r\nextreme poses in time. Next, brush stroke trajectories defined by the keyframe\r\nHDMs are in-betweened automatically across intermediate frames. Finally, each\r\nHDM of each generated in-between frame is traversed and all elements are drawn\r\none on another from back to front.\r\nOur techniques support highly rendered styles which are particularly difficult\r\nto animate by traditional means including the ‘airbrushed’, scraperboard, watercolour,\r\nGouache, ‘ink-wash’, pastel, and the ‘crayon’ styles.

The answer up to now has been, too often, to say \"this is not specified\" whereas the existing content dictionary mechanism of OpenMath allows it to include formal properties which state mathematical facts that should stay uncontradicted while manipulating the symbols.\r\nThe contribution of this paper is to propose methods to exploit the content dictionaries so as to allow an OpenMath-consuming tool to process expressions even if containing symbols it did not know about before. This approach is generalized to allow such newly discovered symbol to be, for example, rendered or input.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davenport, J H","Libbrecht, P"],"dc:date":"2008-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2801543,"sim:weight":0.118394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2804260,"sim:weight":0.0681305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A key signalling molecule produced in guard cells in response to plant hormones, light, carbon dioxide and pathogen-derived signals is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The mechanisms by which H2O2 integrates multiple signals via specific signalling pathways leading to stomatal closure is not known.\r\n\u003cb\u003ePrincipal Findings:\u003c/b\u003e\r\nHere, we identify a pathway by which H2O2, derived from endogenous and environmental stimuli, is sensed and transduced to effect stomatal closure. Histidine kinases (HK) are part of two-component signal transduction systems that act to integrate environmental stimuli into a cellular response via a phosphotransfer relay mechanism. There is little known about the function of the HK AHK5 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we report that in addition to the predicted cytoplasmic localisation of this protein, AHK5 also appears to co-localise to the plasma membrane. Although AHK5 is expressed at low levels in guard cells, we identify a unique role for AHK5 in stomatal signalling. Arabidopsis mutants lacking AHK5 show reduced stomatal closure in response to H2O2, which is reversed by complementation with the wild type gene. Over-expression of AHK5 results in constitutively less stomatal closure. Abiotic stimuli that generate endogenous H2O2, such as darkness, nitric oxide and the phytohormone ethylene, also show reduced stomatal closure in the ahk5 mutants. However, ABA caused closure, dark adaptation induced H2O2 production and H2O2 induced NO synthesis in mutants. Treatment with the bacterial pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) flagellin, but not elf peptide, also exhibited reduced stomatal closure and H2O2 generation in ahk5 mutants.\r\n\u003cb\u003eSignificance: \u003c/b\u003e\r\n\r\nOur findings identify an integral signalling function for AHK5 that acts to integrate multiple signals via H2O2 homeostasis and is independent of ABA signalling in guard cells.","bibo:AuthorList":["Desikan, R","Horak, J","Chaban, C","Mira-Rodado, V","Witthoft, J","Elgass, K","Grefen, C","Cheung, M-K","Meixner, A J","Hooley, R","Neill, S J","Travers Hancock, J","Harter, K"],"dc:date":"2008-06-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.193455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Employment sustainability is central to achieving this goal and thus it is important to understand the factors that affect sustainability. When the lone mother starts work, her daily life changes in various ways, and so do the lives of her children, and perhaps also other family members who may become involved in childcare, or in other forms of help. These social relationships – at home, in work, in care settings, at school – may be a key element in employment sustainability, and one that has not yet been systematically explored in research. This article draws on data from an ongoing longitudinal qualitative study of lone mothers and their children, which has been following the families from the point that the mothers left income support and started working for at least 16 hours per week. The analysis starts from the assumption that sustaining work over time is a process that actively involves the family as a whole and not just the individual lone mother. In this article we explore how social relationships, inside and outside the family, are central to the ‘family–work project’ of sustaining employment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Millar, Jane","Ridge, Teresa"],"dc:date":"2009-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383621,"sim:weight":0.683676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386664,"sim:weight":0.661826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105340,"sim:weight":0.60101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99496,"sim:weight":0.549367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96317,"sim:weight":0.544172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88951,"sim:weight":0.536829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46638,"sim:weight":0.525667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17849,"sim:weight":0.519044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383650,"sim:weight":0.518155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.511838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383655,"sim:weight":0.51123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66883,"sim:weight":0.446172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99461,"sim:weight":0.443464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1922491,"sim:weight":0.441223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44423,"sim:weight":0.441213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.432697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496274,"sim:weight":0.417117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381912,"sim:weight":0.410537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48295,"sim:weight":0.400459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.399938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The work has involved developing some general equations for calculating the contributions which the axially loaded spokes and the bending flexure of the rim make to hub displacement and hence hub-to-rim wheel stiffness. The work considers the effect which the spoke tightening preload has on the distribution of load throughout the wheel and also the influence it has on wheel stiffness. The developed theory has been applied to some modern racing cycle wheels which have just a few spokes and use a relatively rigid, part tubular cross-section rim. Such designs are evaluated, using actual mechanical properties, and their behaviour is discussed against more traditional multi-spoke wheel designs which have relatively much more flexible rims. The theory has been compared with the results obtained from experimentally load testing a bicycle wheel using 12 and 18 spoke variants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Minguez, J M","Vogwell, Jeffrey"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108918,"sim:weight":0.394658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68143,"sim:weight":0.208322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.198657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.196923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59004,"sim:weight":0.195304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387172,"sim:weight":0.19427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.192158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.191855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68067,"sim:weight":0.186039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.184869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.182673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25819,"sim:weight":0.178608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.17242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45745,"sim:weight":0.172379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.171461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387311,"sim:weight":0.167528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99089,"sim:weight":0.166454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98638,"sim:weight":0.165279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.157453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.153436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Cross-flow velocity measurements and flow visualization were performed for the three realistic jet positions on both equal and unequal strength like-signed vortices for a range of momentum coefficients. The main finding was that the initial jet position has a vastly contrasting effect on the merging process. If the jet turbulence rapidly interacts with only one of the vortices, severe diffusion of that vortex occurs which ultimately wraps around and becomes consumed by the unaffected vortex structure. The jet causes a reduction in the vortex spacing and an increase in the rotation angle; hence, merging is promoted. If the jet turbulence does not directly interact with either vortex but instead interferes with the mechanism in the outer-recirculation region that advects vorticity to a larger radius, then merging can be retarded. In this case, an increase in vortex spacing and reduction in rotation angle were observed. Increasing the momentum coefficient, hence, introducing more turbulence into the flow, has a greater effect on the merging process. \u0026copy; 2008 American Institute of Physics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marles, David","Gursul, Ismet"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2805727,"sim:weight":0.449576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113842,"sim:weight":0.438076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2803683,"sim:weight":0.331602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2810555,"sim:weight":0.3123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100831,"sim:weight":0.127067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397148,"sim:weight":0.127067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Is this a mammalian particularity or symptomatic of exonic splicing regulation across taxa? Are such trends more common in species that a priori have a harder time identifying exon ends, that is, those with pre-mRNA rich in intronic sequence? We address these questions surveying exon composition in a sample of phylogenetically diverse genomes. Results: Biased amino acid usage near exon-intron boundaries is common throughout the metazoa but not restricted to the metazoa. There is extensive cross-species concordance as to which amino acids are affected, and reduced/elevated abundances are well predicted by knowledge of splice enhancers. Species expected to rely on exon definition for splicing, that is, those with a higher ratio of intronic to coding sequence, more introns per gene and longer introns, exhibit more amino acid skews. Notably, this includes the intron-rich basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans, which, unlike intron-poor ascomycetes (Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae), exhibits compositional biases reminiscent of the metazoa. Strikingly, 5 prime ends of nematode exons deviate radically from normality: amino acids strongly preferred near boundaries are strongly avoided in other species, and vice versa. This we suggest is a measure to avoid attracting trans-splicing machinery. Conclusion: Constraints on amino acid composition near exon-intron boundaries are phylogenetically widespread and characteristic of species where exon localization should be problematic. That compositional biases accord with sequence preferences of splice-regulatory proteins and are absent in ascomycetes is consistent with selection on exonic splicing regulation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Warnecke, T.","Parmley, J.

This has led to the proposal that Alus might be modifying the expression breadth of neighboring genes, possibly by providing CpG islands, modifying transcription factor binding, or altering chromatin structure. Here we consider whether Alus have increased expression breadth of genes in their vicinity. Results: Contrary to the modification hypothesis, we find that those genes that have always had broad expression are richest in Alus, whereas those that are more likely to have become more broadly expressed have lower enrichment. This finding is consistent with a model in which Alus accumulate near broadly expressed genes but do not affect their expression breadth. Furthermore, this model is consistent with the finding that expression breadth of mouse genes predicts Alu density near their human orthologs. However, Alus were found to be related to some alternative measures of transcription profile divergence, although evidence is contradictory as to whether Alus associate with lowly or highly diverged genes. If Alu have any effect it is not by provision of CpG islands, because they are especially rare near to transcriptional start sites. Previously reported Alu enrichment for genes serving certain cellular functions, suggested to be evidence of functional importance of Alus, appears to be partly a byproduct of the association with broadly expressed genes. Conclusion: The abundance of Alu near broadly expressed genes is better explained by their preferential preservation near to housekeeping genes rather than by a modifying effect on expression of genes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Urrutia, A.

Horizontal gene transfer contributes to the genetic diversity of this pathogen and may be an important determinant of virulence potential. The genome contains genomic island (GI) regions that encode a broad array of functions. Although there is some evidence for the variable distribution of genomic islands in B. pseudomallei isolates, little is known about the extent of variation between related strains or their association with disease or environmental survival. Results: Five islands from B. pseudomallei strain K96243 were chosen as representatives of different types of genomic islands present in this strain, and their presence investigated in other B. pseudomallei. In silico analysis of 10 B. pseudomallei genome sequences provided evidence for the variable presence of these regions, together with micro-evolutionary changes that generate GI diversity. The diversity of GIs in 186 isolates from NE Thailand (83 environmental and 103 clinical isolates) was investigated using multiplex PCR screening. The proportion of all isolates positive by PCR ranged from 12% for a prophage-like island (GI 9), to 76% for a metabolic island (GI 16). The presence of each of the five GIs did not differ between environmental and disease-associated isolates (p \u003e 0.05 for all five islands). The cumulative number of GIs per isolate for the 186 isolates ranged from 0 to 5 (median 2, IQR 1 to 3). The distribution of cumulative GI number did not differ between environmental and disease-associated isolates (p \u003d 0.27). The presence of GIs was defined for the three largest clones in this collection (each defined as a single sequence type, ST, by multilocus sequence typing); these were ST 70 (n \u003d 15 isolates), ST 54 (n \u003d 11), and ST 167 (n \u003d 9). The rapid loss and/or acquisition of gene islands was observed within individual clones. Comparisons were drawn between isolates obtained from the environment and from patients with melioidosis in order to examine the role of genomic islands in virulence and clinical associations. There was no reproducible association between the individual or cumulative presence of five GIs and a range of clinical features in 103 patients with melioidosis. Conclusion: Horizontal gene transfer of mobile genetic elements can rapidly alter the gene repertoire of B. pseudomallei. This study confirms the utility of a range of approaches in defining the presence and significance of genomic variation in natural populations of B. pseudomallei.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tumapa, S.","Holden, M.

Neural crest cells (NCCs) are multipotent, yet the mechanisms driving specific fate choices remain incompletely understood. Sox10 is required for specification of neural cells and melanocytes from NCCs. Like sox10 mutants, zebrafish shady mutants lack iridophores; we have proposed that sox10 and shady are required for iridophore specification from NCCs. We show using diverse approaches that shady encodes zebrafish leukocyte tyrosine kinase (Ltk). Cell transplantation studies show that Ltk acts cell-autonomously within the iridophore lineage. Consistent with this, ltk is expressed in a subset of NCCs, before becoming restricted to the iridophore lineage. Marker analysis reveals a primary defect in iridophore specification in ltk mutants. We saw no evidence for a fate-shift of neural crest cells into other pigment cell fates and some NCCs were subsequently lost by apoptosis. These features are also characteristic of the neural crest cell phenotype in sox10 mutants, leading us to examine iridophores in sox10 mutants. As expected, sox10 mutants largely lacked iridophore markers at late stages. In addition, sox10 mutants unexpectedly showed more ltk-expressing cells than wild-type siblings. These cells remained in a premigratory position and expressed sox10 but not the earliest neural crest markers and may represent multipotent, but partially-restricted, progenitors. In summary, we have discovered a novel signalling pathway in NCC development and demonstrate fate specification of iridophores as the first identified role for Ltk.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lopes, S.

Compared with existing approaches to LRMC pricing, the proposed approach produces forward-looking charges that reflect both the extent of the network needed to service the generation and/or load, and the degree to which that network is utilized","bibo:AuthorList":["Li, Furong"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2804312,"sim:weight":0.612506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2809250,"sim:weight":0.554616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108846,"sim:weight":0.435524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108453,"sim:weight":0.402576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108345,"sim:weight":0.366117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.361023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.314945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.30113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.277546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734349,"sim:weight":0.247853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.231217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Structural equation modeling supported a model in which perceived job pressure, perceptions of student self-determination, and teacher autonomous orientation predicted teacher psychological need satisfaction, which, in turn positively influenced teacher self-determination. The last positively predicted the use of all three strategies. Direct positive effects of teachers\u0027 psychological need satisfaction on the strategies of gaining an understanding of students and instrumental help and support were also found. In summary, factors that influence teacher motivation may also indirectly affect their motivational strategies toward students.","bibo:AuthorList":["Taylor, I.

An interpretive phenomeno-logical approach was adopted. Twenty-one interviews were held with 14 residents at baseline and 7 residents at follow-up. Although their expectations were initially conservative, by the end of the intervention participants noted improved quality of life through better mobility, decreased fear of falling, and feelings of achievement and success. They valued the program as an opportunity to do something for themselves, to add something to their weekly routine, to meet other people, and to be more active generally. The professionalism of the exercise instructor appears to have been critical, balancing principles of safe and effective practice with the need to ensure that participants had fun in a supportive environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stathi, A.","Simey, P."],"dc:date":"2007-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85368,"sim:weight":0.555041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.48063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60745,"sim:weight":0.474666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.472901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.453236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.450656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75615,"sim:weight":0.442498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222867,"sim:weight":0.412432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.410942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70031,"sim:weight":0.404489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.403991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75338,"sim:weight":0.400055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60662,"sim:weight":0.398944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.396762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52534,"sim:weight":0.393362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23317,"sim:weight":0.388739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.38212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632061,"sim:weight":0.368749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.366855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.366855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In earlier decades after liberation, NGOs operated within a normative assumption of secular democracy and a separation between civil society and state. This position was challenged by the realities of military governments between 1975 and 1990, and by problematic governance and corruption since 1991. However, within the context of global faith based movements, the centre of gravity political culture is now shifting to confront these secular and liberal assumptions. Bangladesh is now a vital site of contestation between the competing traditions of secularity and the ‘ummah’, and thus between western (donor led) conceptions of a civil society and a more faith-based fundamentalist basis of political inclusion and incorporation. The Islamicisation of political culture is also generating a split within the NGO community. Some NGOs, with a previous secular perspective, have opted to avoid engagement by re-positioning their profile solely in terms of service delivery. Other, often more recent, NGOs promote ‘Islamic values’ and are comfortable with their incorporation into a concept of ‘ummah’. However, there remains a significant third group of NGOs, with secular origins, which are trying to steer a complex course, pursuing secular democracy via a rights based agenda especially around women, yet differentiating themselves from the donor, western agenda. Thus they are embarked on a basic contestation over the meaning of nationalism in Bangladesh.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wood, G.

Since mixture models are often of variable dimension, it will be verified that tempered transitions and the tuning technique can also be applied in variable-dimensional problems.

A key feature of the analyses is the construction of counterfactual scenarios and the application of a methodology that adjusts for selectivity bias.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boakye-Yiadom, Louis"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":17274,"sim:weight":0.645012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108730,"sim:weight":0.633542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77488,"sim:weight":0.578108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710554,"sim:weight":0.573065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":606705,"sim:weight":0.522349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30508,"sim:weight":0.486531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709774,"sim:weight":0.467606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108670,"sim:weight":0.443944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2804651,"sim:weight":0.39785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109092,"sim:weight":0.382744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93951,"sim:weight":0.366932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93952,"sim:weight":0.36662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.34667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45893,"sim:weight":0.344122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":917067,"sim:weight":0.342175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26164,"sim:weight":0.339927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.334211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":546197,"sim:weight":0.334026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108460,"sim:weight":0.328151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.322211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Commission identified the need to diversify the labour market and shift towards occupational groupings based on skills, attitudes and competence. However, fifteen years on, Botswana’s dependence on diamond mining, coupled with immigration from neighbouring countries and a mismatch of skills supply and demand has resulted in a pool of labour exceeding the number of jobs available. Access, opportunity and social inclusion therefore represent major challenges, since large numbers of under and un-utilised people imply a heavy socioeconomic burden.\r\nThis thesis employed a Problem Based Methodology within the framework of a Project Cycle Management approach to develop a project for an Adult Basic Vocational Education and Training (ABVET) programme as a contribution towards the\r\ndevelopment of human and social capital in Botswana.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cook, Kathryn E."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Phosphatidylinositol lipids including PtdIns(3,5)P2 have been implicated in the MVB-lysosomal pathway and an ESCRT-III component CHMP3 binds to this lipid in vitro.\r\nThe purpose of this thesis was to investigate the link between ESCRT proteins, PtdIns(3,5)P2 and endo-lysosomal trafficking. Firstly, a protein expressed by Salmonella, which is a phosphatase that acts on PtdIns(3,5)P2, was investigated as a potential tool for manipulating cellular PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels.

Long analysis windows are required for adequate low-frequency resolution, while small windows offer lower latency, better handling of transients, and reduced computation cost.  A constant-$Q$ form of analysis offers the possibility of increased low-frequency resolution for a given window size, this resolution being essential for many fundamental processing tasks such as pitch shifting.\r\n\r\nWe consider the application of the Sliding Discrete Fourier Transform to a Constant-$Q$ analysis.  The increased flexibility of sliding allows for a variety of data alignments, and we produce the mathematical formulation of these.

The participants, consisting of six Singapore primary teachers at grade 4, were engaged in group discussions that were spread over a period of one year to complete an action research project which is integrated in day-to-day work. Teachers Network Learning Circle, a formal professional development platform, employs distinctive tools for dialogue and inquiry based on the principles of voluntary participation, reflection, change and trust. The fundamental reason for choosing this site is its potential to empower and emancipate teachers evident from not only the principles and practices it espouses, but also its vision and mission that is consistent with its motto “For Teachers, By Teachers”. The literature on education change and reforms has point towards teacher empowerment for successful education change. In this regard, investing in teacher professional development and professionalism is important. The literature also point towards embracing a sociological perspective evident in the notions of community and socio-cultural theory, and bringing to bear emotions, values and identity in teacher learning – and thus investing in the ‘whole person’ (Day, 1997). As power underlies all social relations and activities including teachers’ learning, the research study took into consideration the perspectives of critical theory of Habermas, Brookfield and Mezirow. The findings of the study found that symmetrical power relation contributed to teacher development and change. First, it had contributed to a collegial collaborative relationship that took into account of emotions, moral, identity development and group solidarity. Second, it had contributed to the consciousness, critique and co-construction of professional knowledge. Third, it had empowered participants insofar as it built participants’ capacities to act successfully within an existing system and structures of power. The symmetrical power relation was undergirded by rules and principles of democratic participation as outlined by Habermas’ discourse ethics. The findings also revealed the importance of support given by the school principal and Teachers Network personnel in protecting democratic spaces, or Habermas’ concept of the lifeworld, from the system imperatives of power and money.","bibo:AuthorList":["Salleh, Hairon"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8768812,"sim:weight":0.748616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106397,"sim:weight":0.735006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160558,"sim:weight":0.723596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146086,"sim:weight":0.717264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.710183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.694074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382036,"sim:weight":0.687815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.687536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77727,"sim:weight":0.687098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309354,"sim:weight":0.684747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5285,"sim:weight":0.68473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731782,"sim:weight":0.675245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44940,"sim:weight":0.673969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82530,"sim:weight":0.670347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387169,"sim:weight":0.670299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98650,"sim:weight":0.669277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9022987,"sim:weight":0.666521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573456,"sim:weight":0.666434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108711,"sim:weight":0.665273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710085,"sim:weight":0.660301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Organizational identities may be regarded as ongoing arguments between insiders and between ostensible insiders and outsiders, who deploy various persuasive techniques in their efforts to render hegemonic their versions of an organization’s identity.  Making plausible through persuasive rhetoric is a complex task, and requires a discourse analytic methodology and an analytical focus on whole utterances, in order to explicate how identity-as-argument is enacted.  The research implications of our paper are twofold.  First, by focusing on language as an opaque phenomenon, taken-for-granted ways of being persuasive are made strange and hence more visible.  Second, our understanding of organizations as situated in ongoing, multi-focused arguments, illustrates a new way of conceptualising the polyphonic, genre-relevant nature of institutional identities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, A.

The paper illustrates how the trainees’ constructions formed a set of discursive practices that were implicated in the constitution of the organization as a regime of power, and how they both accommodated and resisted these practices. Our case focuses on the trainees’ discursive construction of normative pressures to conform, compliant and non-compliant types of worker, and explicit acts of silencing, together with their reflexive interrogation of the nexus of discursive constraints on their opportunities to be heard. Drawing on the analytical resources associated with the ‘linguistic turn’ in organization studies, our research is an exploration of the importance of language as a medium of social control and power, and means of self-authorship. It is also an attempt to locate ‘silence’ in putatively polyphonic organizations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, A.

We start by examining how research using fictional narrative methods has worked to radically destabilise distinctions between what is real and what is fictional.  In relation to this we ask the question: if a research account can be regarded as fiction, what are the implications of this insight for the responsibilities of authors?  Opposing the view that using fiction necessarily leads to an ‘anything goes’ relativism, we argue that a recognition of the fictionality of research texts implies a heightened sense of researcher-author responsibility.  We see our main contribution as extending existing discussions of reflexivity in research into a consideration of issues of ethics and responsibility as it relates to the textuality of research writing.  To do so we draw on Derrida’s theorisation of responsibility and undecidability as a way of problematising and discussing the ethics of research in relation to its textuality.  We argue that the explicit borrowing from fictional genres evinces the essentially ‘written’ and fictional status of research papers, and highlights the ethical dimensions associated with decisions related to representational strategies and authorial subjectivity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, A.

By defining collective identities as the totality of such narratives I draw attention to their complex, and often fragmented and heterogeneous nature. My approach contrasts with much of the theorising in this field which has tended to homogenize collective identities by emphasizing what is common or shared, failed to capture the interplay between different communities within organizations, and produced bland, undifferentiated empirical research. In particular, the theoretical framework that I outline focuses attention on the importance of reflexivity, voice, plurivocity, temporality, and fictionality to an understanding of collective identities as locales for competing hegemonic claims. In combination, these notions form a unique conceptual model for theorising and researching collective identities. This said, a narrative approach also has its limitations, and is proposed as an additional, not exclusive, interpretive lens.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, A.

We focus in particular, but not exclusively on how the groups’ shared understandings of ‘place’ informed their identity accounts. Identities are theorised as being constituted within discursive regimes, and place treated as a discursive resource on which individuals and groups may draw in their attempts to author versions of their selves. In our case, understandings of place were also a resource on which some people drew in nostalgic reminiscence, and others used to fantasise about their preferred futures for the college. Framed by our intention to identify plurivocal native interpretations of place and identity in ways that promote the reading of polysemy back into case research, the contribution this paper makes is threefold. First, it adds to efforts to theorize organizations and identities as unstable social constructions constituted through acts of languaging. Second, it illustrates how different groups of local actors with distinct histories and value preferences may draw on their place of work in order to author contrasting versions of their organization’s identity. Finally, our paper analyses the attempts made by senior managers and groups of other staff to define their organization in particular ways, as hegemonic ‘moves’ in an ongoing struggle for control over the organization as a discursive space.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, A.

It starts from the position that not all firms can or should implement the same set of practices. Design/methodology/approach – Critical incident technique and semi-structured interviews over five years were used to understand the influence of institutional and strategic choices during the implementation of a supplier park. A conceptual framework was developed to incorporate practices broadly associated with parks, i.e. improving supply stability, supply coordination, redefining the OEM/supplier boundary and enhancing interaction between co-located firms. Findings – The findings demonstrate a limited implementation of supply practices at Bridgend with only one component supplier brought onto the site. The original plan was to create a supplier park that would “grow” to an industrial park, creating an automotive sector in the area. However, a combination of operational, processual, and contextual factors have conspired against the plan. Research limitations/implications – The combination of a broad range of theoretical and practical elements means there are associated discussions that could be more fully explored. Condensing the interview notes has resulted in the researchers\u0027 own interpretation of events becoming a significant reality filter. Whilst single case studies raise inevitable concerns over comparability, our focus is on theoretical generalizability through richness of empirical data. Originality/value – As firms continue to use best practice as a core ingredient of strategy, researchers must respond with robust theoretical concepts explaining adoption and implementation. This paper integrates disparate perspectives across multiple levels in order to build a richer and more believable picture of a stalled initiative. Three key conclusions can be drawn: the contingent nature of “bundles of practice” implications of political ambiguity over the efficiency argument and the effect of isomorphic or bandwagon responses by firms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Howard, M","Miemczyk, J","Lewis, M","Brandon-Jones, A"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We have adopted a narrative approach to the analysis of organizational processes in order to explore how individuals in a financial institution dealt with relatively novel issues of corporate social responsibility (CSR).  The narratives that we reconstruct, which we label ‘idealism and altruism’, ‘economics and expedience’, and ‘ignorance and cynicism’ illustrate how people in the specific organizational context of a bank (‘Credit Line’ ) sought to cope with an attempt at narrative imposition. In particular, our work exemplifies how people in organizations draw on shared discursive resources in order to make sense of themselves and their organizations. We illustrate how many people within the bank found it hard to integrate the normative case for CSR with their version of a narrative identity which had, and continued to be, centred on economic imperatives for new initiatives. Our paper both demonstrates the value of the analysis of shared narratives, and represents an attempt to deal adequately with the polyphony of organizational voices, in case studies of CSR.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, A.

In business-to-business (B2B) marketing environments, decision-making becomes even more complicated. The decision-makers require an adequate set of facts to support their decision-making. In order to provide the necessary decision-support, B2B organisations invest huge amounts of money in information systems such as enterprise resources planning applications, customer relationship management software, and other types of databases. These systems store, analyse, manipulate and/or integrate internal data and perhaps force-feed it to the decision-makers; what we call a foie-gras approach. On the other hand, organisations may allow the decision-makers to search for the desired facts or decision-support by themselves; what we refer to as anarchic resources utilisation. Alternatively, the decision-makers may utilise resources with a combination of the two approaches. Previous studies have shown that many factors may influence the resources utilisation; however, not many studies have been conducted in the B2B context. This research, therefore, aims to provide a better understanding of how decision-makers utilise the available resources by firstly identifying B2B factors affecting the resources utilisation, and then explaining how these factors influence them. Results from in-depth interviews with the marketing decision-makers from three case studies show that the value of customers, supplier-customer relationships, and the nature of demand are the most influential B2B factors affecting the resources utilisation of the decision-makers. Other factors such as experience, nature of decisions, and management style are also found to have considerable impact on the approach the decision-makers adopt. In order to provide adequate decision-support, the providers may need to consider these factors and understand their effects on the decision-makers in the organisation, and design or choose the right information system(s); this should then result in better quality decisions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Susiva, Suthasinee"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.606452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56605,"sim:weight":0.514203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.507921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85837,"sim:weight":0.471778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":740031,"sim:weight":0.460968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9021824,"sim:weight":0.450324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.442329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104894,"sim:weight":0.436559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.43562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":921378,"sim:weight":0.368238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.367807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.367807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.359702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999781,"sim:weight":0.339385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337004,"sim:weight":0.319133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336249,"sim:weight":0.276715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2810967,"sim:weight":0.271043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1039309,"sim:weight":0.268488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86696,"sim:weight":0.268479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333972,"sim:weight":0.264131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Drawing upon data from interviews across a range of employees, we analyse aspects of emotion, identity and power. Adopting a constructionist perspective we use a method of discourse analysis to analyse how participants constructed emotions according to tacitly understood rules regarding appropriate emotional displays. These rules were made visible through an examination of the participants\u0027 positioning strategies as they described emotional experiences. Our findings suggest that, rather than an institutionally held level of appropriate articulations of emotionality, there was a role-related, socially located rule system linked to separate categories of teachers, managers and administrative employees. The contribution of the article is threefold. First, we use in-depth case data from 44 semi-structured interviews to analyse how teachers and managers/administrators in a UK-based further education (FE) college constructed emotions according to certain rules (informal norms) regarding appropriate kinds of emotional displays. Teachers acknowledged and upgraded labelled emotions, while managers and administrators denied and downgraded accounts of emotional experiences. Second, we discuss the implications of talk about emotion for the (re)production of teachers\u0027 and managers/administrators\u0027 work identities. Third, we consider how people\u0027s talk about emotions was bound-up in relations of power.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coupland,  Christine","Brown, A.

Embedded in a narratological approach to sensemaking research, we argue that before scholars may be able to understand in detail how agreements are reached and action becomes coordinated, we need first to take seriously the proposition that sensemaking occurs in the context of individuals’ idiosyncratic efforts at identity construction. This, we suggest, means attending to the narratives that actors tell about their work and self both for others and their selves. The key research contribution that we make is to demonstrate how work on ‘impression management’ and ‘attributional egotism’ may be employed in order to account for discrepant sensemaking. This is important in the context of a literature that has left relatively unexplored the reasons why people interpret differently experiences they have in common.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Andrew","Stacey, P","Nandhakumar, J"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1584990,"sim:weight":0.685145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585225,"sim:weight":0.615786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585336,"sim:weight":0.583283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585407,"sim:weight":0.568242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585090,"sim:weight":0.563824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585242,"sim:weight":0.53522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55278,"sim:weight":0.53451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93176,"sim:weight":0.510224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585464,"sim:weight":0.504533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52976,"sim:weight":0.480232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93370,"sim:weight":0.452578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585217,"sim:weight":0.429789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42197,"sim:weight":0.41917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.411401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197566,"sim:weight":0.240365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197572,"sim:weight":0.174127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197571,"sim:weight":0.166197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197570,"sim:weight":0.158307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both management challenges\r\nand their resolutions are theoretically organised on the global-local continuum,\r\nreflecting the inter-connected and mutually influencing nature of the social reality.\r\nThe abstract social process of ‘resourcing change’ has general implications beyond\r\nthe temporal and spatial boundaries of the study – managers in one UK subsidiary\r\nwithin each of two multinational corporations – Cooper Standard (UK) and Ricoh\r\n(UK), respectively, at the time when this study was conducted. The grounded theory\r\nof ‘resourcing change’ has made several significant theoretical and methodological\r\ncontributions. First, the study of learning has been extended to the management\r\npopulation, given their strategic importance in organisations (Easterby-Smith et al.,\r\n1998). Second, management learning in organisations is conceptualised as ‘initiation\r\nof change’ – a seldom recognised, individual-to-organisation process of change\r\n(Quinn, 1996). Learning, as in this study, has been re-connected to accounts of\r\norganisational change (Hendry, 1996). A particular emphasis is placed on the\r\ninitiation stage of change, not on any other stages (e.g. implementation). Third, from a\r\nprocess-relational perspective of organising and managing (Watson, 2002), this\r\ngrounded theory study of ‘resourcing change’ has identified the contradictions in\r\nmany processual-oriented research studies, highlighting the absence of the temporal\r\nand spatial dimensions in the on-going evolution of social processes. The\r\nmethodological contributions that this grounded theory study makes are, first and\r\nforemost, the conceptualisation of the emerged concepts that are used to explain the\r\nprocess of initiating change in management learning. Research problems and\r\nquestions are then formulated by abstractly conceptualising the concerns and\r\nresolutions of research participants, as opposed to the researcher’s own. This study\r\nbegins with no focus, however uncomfortable that may make some researchers,\r\nrecognising the key fact that the focus of the researcher, prior to his or her exposure to\r\nthe research participants, has no relevance whatsoever to them. The focus is only\r\nestablished at the end of the study, following a set of rigorous and transparent\r\nmethodological procedures. The adherence to the orthodox grounded theory (Glaser \u0026\r\nStrauss, 1967) confirms that grounded theory is a fully-fledged research methodology\r\nin its own right, not a set of methods for data analysis (McCallin, 2003).","bibo:AuthorList":["Fei, Foster"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58839,"sim:weight":0.691986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.68648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99444,"sim:weight":0.677417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.673547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.673407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47010,"sim:weight":0.666281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.650161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383596,"sim:weight":0.648371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.624092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47013,"sim:weight":0.612482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109101,"sim:weight":0.608442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99383,"sim:weight":0.604977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4688,"sim:weight":0.600991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98643,"sim:weight":0.594938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43029,"sim:weight":0.594207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383624,"sim:weight":0.593129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45900,"sim:weight":0.592845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100118,"sim:weight":0.591498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025005,"sim:weight":0.589361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54627,"sim:weight":0.587811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Amongst these are\r\nhydroxycoumarins (e.g. scopoletin and its glucoside scopolin) which play roles in plant defence and have\r\npharmacological activities. Some steps in the biosynthesis of these molecules are still unknown in cassava\r\nand in other plants. We exploit the accumulation of these coumarins during PPD to investigate\r\nthe E-Z-isomerisation step in their biosynthesis. Feeding cubed cassava roots with E-cinnamic-\r\n3,20,30,40,50,60-d5 acid gave scopoletin-d2. However, feeding with E-cinnamic-3,20,30,40,50,60-d6 and\r\nE-cinnamic-2,3,20,30,40,50,60-d7 acids, both gave scopoletin-d3, the latter not affording the expected scopoletin-\r\nd4. We therefore synthesised and fed with E-cinnamic-2-d1 when unlabelled scopoletin was biosynthesised.\r\nSolely the hydrogen (or deuterium) at C2 of cinnamic acid is exchanged in the biosynthesis of\r\nhydroxycoumarins. If the mechanism of E-Z-cinnamic acid isomerisation were photochemical, we would\r\nnot expect to see the loss of deuterium which we observed. Therefore, a possible mechanism is an\r\nenzyme catalysed 1,4-Michael addition, followed by r-bond rotation and hydrogen (or deuterium)\r\nelimination to yield the Z-isomer. Feeding the roots under light and dark conditions with E-cinnamic-\r\n2,3,20,30,40,50,60-d7 acid gave scopoletin-d3 with no significant difference in the yields. We conclude that\r\nthe E-Z-isomerisation stage in the biosynthesis of scopoletin and scopolin, in cassava roots during PPD,\r\nis not photochemical, but could be catalysed by an isomerase which is independent of light.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bayoumi, S.A.L.","Rowan, M.G.","Blagbrough, I.S.","Beeching, J.R."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.257089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84807,"sim:weight":0.252631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387352,"sim:weight":0.239383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.237694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45719,"sim:weight":0.236089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102560,"sim:weight":0.234257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.230448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26544,"sim:weight":0.227971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85118,"sim:weight":0.225548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.21454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.21454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.20845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1390521,"sim:weight":0.206614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.203547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386959,"sim:weight":0.200168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.197619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56462,"sim:weight":0.195724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48385,"sim:weight":0.195336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352214,"sim:weight":0.191968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101526,"sim:weight":0.191401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These guidelines have been successful in raising awareness in Web accessibility at a political level, but have been less successful than might have been expected influencing the wider promotion and adoption of accessibility in Web technology. This is increasingly apparent as Web content becomes increasingly heterogeneous in terms of source, type, author and function. Standards, policy and guidelines overwhelmingly focus on accessibility of the end product - i.e. the Web page or site - and not the process used to create it. This is at odds with the transformation of Web-based user goals from receipt of static information to communication, and receipt or delivery of services and experiences. Thus it is the accessibility of the end goal that should be critical, and is dependent on the quality of the route(s) available to reaching that goal - making assessing accessibility of a technical unit such as a Web page less relevant. Instead, we argue a holistic approach is necessary - one that views positively, where appropriate, aggregation of alternatives in a way that allows each route to provide the best possible chance for disabled users to achieve the end goal, even if individual routes may themselves exclude certain groups.

We investigated a label-free electrical detection system using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy that is able to detect hybridization of DNA target sequences derived from avian H5N1 influenza virus to gold surface-attached single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide probes. A 23-nt probe is able to detect a 120-nt base fragment of the influenza A hemagglutinin gene sequence. We describe a novel method of data analysis that is compatible with automatic measurement without operator input, contrary to curve fitting used in conventional electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data analysis. A systematic investigation of the detection signal for various spacer molecules between the oligonucleotide probe and the gold surface revealed that the signal/background ratio improves as the length of the spacer increases, with a 12- to 18-atom spacer element being optimal. The optimal spacer molecule allows a detection limit between 30 and 100 fmol DNA with a macroscopic gold disc electrode of I mm radius. The dependence of the detection signal on the concentration of a 23-nt target follows a binding curve with an approximate 1:1 stoichiometry and a dissociation constant of K-D \u003d 13 +/- 4 nM at 295 K.

The United States developed Global Positioning System (GPS) is the only current fully operational system; however further systems are in development. The GPS has shown considerable success for navigation, but it still has a number of problems that limit its accuracy. The two main problems are the ionosphere and local environment of the receiver. The ionosphere causes a delay and random rapid shifts in phase and amplitude (scintillation) to the signal. The local environment can provide the signal with multiple routes (multi-path) to the receiver. In this project a GPS signal simulator is developed, which models the effects of the ionosphere and multi-path on the modulated signals. The focus is made on the GPS system as the simulator measurements can be compared to the real measurements; however other systems will be considered in the future. A number of experiments investigating multi-path and ionospheric effects on a receiver’s ability to track the signals have been completed. The simulator has been used to replicate a real local multi-path environment and the results have been compared. Further investigations of the multi-path have shown a unique multi-path signature in the receiver power output. The later part of the thesis describes a case study investigating a short but rapid period of scintillation observed on three receivers based in Norway. An analysis of the multi-path environment was completed, but was found not to be the cause. The ionosphere was investigated using equipment based across Scandinavia. The equipment showed that geomagnetic conditions were disturbed at the time of the event. The GPS measurements were compared with all-sky camera data to show that the scintillation can be attributed to the GPS signal path crossing electron density structures associated with the aurora.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Andrew M."],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Flk-1 is expressed initially on the haemangioblast, the common precursor of haemopoietic and endothelial cells, and on subsequent committed endothelial lineages. Flk-1 expression is maintained on adult endothelial cells and mediates angiogenesis, making it an important pharmaceutical target in the pathology of many human diseases including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. Though involvement of Flk-1 in disease has lead to its extensive study in adult humans little is known about the signals it mediates during development.\r\nUsing ES cells as a model of development, the aim of this investigation was to identify signals mediated through Flk-1 during early development and to characterise their relative importance in the formation of the haemopoietic, endothelial and cardiomyocyte lineages. Activation of the MAPK and PLC signalling pathways were demonstrated following VEGF treatment of Flk-1-expressing embryoid bodyderived cells, though surprisingly activation of Flk-1 did not appear to mediate activation of the PI3K signalling pathway. Use of an embryoid body-based endothelial sprouting assay demonstrated a requirement for Flk-1 in both endothelial specification and angiogenic expansion. However, this activity was not mediated through either the MAPK or PI3K pathways. The finding that the PI3K pathway is not activated following VEGF stimulation nor required for early vasculogenesis/angiogenesis is surprising given its important role in both homeostatic and pathological angiogenesis in the adult. Previous work had suggested a role for Flk-1 in cardiac differentiation. Investigation of cardiomyocyte differentiation using Flk-1 null ES cells demonstrated a delay in formation of beating cardiomyocytes suggesting that Flk-1 may be involved in, but not required for cardiomyocyte specification. Finally, Flk-1-Tet-on ES cell lines were generated to facilitate investigation of the temporal importance of Flk-1 signalling during different developmental processes. Due to unforeseen difficulties in the maintenance of Flk-1 expression upon ES cell differentiation the full potential of this system was not realised in this study.","bibo:AuthorList":["McRae, Lisa Angharad"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.125468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.110513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0952955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.0930466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23816,"sim:weight":0.0912922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There are more than 1000 GPCRs in metazoans, while no GPCR has been definitively identified in plants. The most promising plant GPCR candidate, Arabidopsis G-protein coupled receptor 1 (GCR1), physically couples to the G-protein \u003c subunit GPA1 and is involved in cell cycle regulation, blue light and phytohormone responses, but its signalling network remains largely unknown. This project aimed to achieve a better understanding of GCR1 signalling by identifying its interactors using a novel yeast two hybrid system – the Ras Recruitment System (RRS). Screening of an Arabidopsis cDNA library using a bait comprising intracellular loop 1 (i1) and 2 (i2) of GCR1 resulted in the isolation of 20 potential interactors. Extensive reconfirmation screening demonstrated that three of these interactors: Thioredoxin h3 (TRX3), Thioredoxin h4 (TRX4) and a DHHC type zinc finger family protein (zf-DHHC1) interact specifically with both i1 and i2 of GCR1. This was supported by the reverse RRS (rRRS) and 6xHis-pull-down assays. It is speculated that TRX3 and TRX4, which can reduce disulfide bridges of target proteins and act as powerful antioxidants, may regulate GCR1-mediated signalling events in response to oxidative stress. Alternatively, they may modulate GCR1 targeting or signalling through their chaperone activities. zf-DHHC1 has a predicted membrane topography that is shared by most DHHC domain-containing palmitoyl acyl transferases. It may modify GCR1 activity through palmitoylation of the two cysteines located at the cytoplasmic end of the first transmembrane domain. Together, these findings contribute to the growing understanding of the GCR1 signalling network, and provide valuable starting points for further investigation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhang, Lihua"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1393909,"sim:weight":0.271187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.200664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.180066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.11942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In plants, imprinting occurs during endosperm development and a balance of maternally- and paternally-expressed imprinted genes is essential for normal seed development. Dependence on DNA methylation for imprinting highlights the potential to manipulate seed development, and consequently seed size, by altering DNA methyltransferase activity. DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) is the primary plant maintenance DNA methyltransferase and plays a significant role in imprinting. However, no evaluation of the potential role for other MET1 family members in genomic imprinting has been reported. The current model for the control of imprinting in plants suggests that maintenance DNA methyltransferases are required throughout development, yet the tissue-specific requirement of these enzymes is unconfirmed as analysis has relied solely on constitutive DNA methyltransferase mutants. To address these problems and to evaluate the potential to alter seed size, the work reported in this thesis investigated the potential involvement of putative maintenance DNA methyltransferases MET2a, MET2b and MET3 and the tissue-specific role of MET1 in imprinting. Imprinting was not significantly altered in met2a-1, met2b-1 and met3-1 mutants, indicating that MET1 is the sole DNA methyltransferase required for imprinting. Transcriptional analysis suggested MET1 is expressed throughout floral organ development and in the male and female gametophyte generation indicating that MET1 is potentially available to maintain imprinting-dependent methylation in these tissues. Tools to suppress MET1 tissuespecifically were developed to investigate the tissue-specific requirement of MET1 for imprinting. Analysis indicates that such tools could also be used to alter seed size by manipulating imprinting in commercially important species. Further work is needed to validate this approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mathers, Lucille Sarah"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, harvested cassava roots have a shelf-life of only days due to post-harvest physiological deterioration (PPD). Within 1-3 days of harvesting, the roots show blue-black vascular streaking and are unpalatable. PPD includes altered gene expression and the accumulation of hydroxycoumarin secondary metabolites, e.g. scopoletin and esculetin, and their respective glucosides scopolin and esculin. In this research several important aspects of the biosynthesis of these phytochemically important hydroxycoumarins were resolved.\r\nStable isotopically labelled intermediates on the postulated biosynthetic pathways of scopoletin were fed to cassava cubes and PPD was allowed to occur. Ethanolic extracts of these deteriorated roots were separated (HPLC) and analysed (HRESI-MS). Incorporation (in both scopoletin and scopolin) of only 3 deuterons from E-cinnamic-2,3,2\u0027,3\u0027,4\u0027,5\u0027,6\u0027-d7 and E-cinnamic-3,2\u0027,3\u0027,4\u0027,5\u0027,6\u0027-d6 is strong support that the E-Zisomerisation step is enzymatic and not photochemical. There are three hypothetical pathways for the biosynthesis of scopoletin via: 2\u0027,4\u0027-dihydroxycinnamate, caffeate, or ferulate. High incorporation of label from p-coumaric-2-13C, caffeic-2-13C and ferulic-2-13C acids was observed into labelled scopoletin and scopolin while there was only a small incorporation from 18O-umbelliferone and 18O-esculetin. We conclude that the major biosynthetic pathway to scopoletin and scopolin is via ferulic acid.\r\nC18O2-enrichment of E-cinnamic and ferulic acids and feeding gave scopoletin containing only one 18O-labelled oxygen atom. Therefore the lactonisation step is through o-hydroxylation and not via a postulated spirolactone-dienone intermediate. These results were confirmed by feeding experiments in an atmosphere of 18O2-air which showed that the major isotopic peak was 18O3-enriched scopoletin.\r\nThree glucosyltransferases were isolated and identified from a cassava PPDrelated cDNA library. These genes are expressed in the cassava storage root during PPD and they are also expressed in the fresh root. While one of these glucosyltransferases was novel, two had previously been isolated from cassava cotyledons.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bayoumi, Soad Abdel Latief Hassan"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.169026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.169026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24544,"sim:weight":0.156752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.143142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26919,"sim:weight":0.123959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316354,"sim:weight":0.109759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85198,"sim:weight":0.105354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.0860846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Equally as interesting is the investigation of the potential computational power of individual spiking neurons. An overview is provided of current and relevant research into the Liquid Sate Machine, biologically inspired artificial STDP learning mechanisms and the investigation of aspects of the computational power of artificial, recurrent networks of spiking neurons. First, it is shown that, using simple structures of spiking Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons, a network n(P), can be built to perform any program P that can be performed by a general parallel programming language. Next, a form of STDP learning with normalisation is developed, referred to as STDP + N learning. The effects of applying this STDP + N learning within recurrently connected networks of neurons is then investigated. It is shown experimentally that, in very specific circumstances Anti-Hebbian and Hebbian STDP learning may be considered to be approximately equivalent processes. A metric is then developed that can be used to measure the distance between any two spike trains. The metric is then used, along with the STDP + N learning, in an experiment to examine the capacity of a single spiking neuron that receives multiple input spike trains, to simultaneously learn many temporally precise Input/Output spike train associations. The STDP +N learning is further modified for use in recurrent networks of spiking neurons, to give the STDP + NType2 learning methodology. An experiment is devised which demonstrates that the Type 2 method of applying learning to the synapses of a recurrent network — effectively a randomly shifting locality of learning — can enable the network to learn firing patterns that the typical application of learning is unable to learn. The resulting networks could, in theory, be used to create to simple structures discussed in the first chapter of original work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carnell, Andrew Robert"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The subject of the paper is the Report of the Allitt Inquiry into attacks on children on Ward Four at Grantham and Kesteven Hospital in the UK.  Premised on an understanding of the Report as crystallized sensemaking, and sensemaking as a narrative process, the paper illustrates how authorial strategies centred on issues of normalization, observation, and absolution are employed to create a rhetorical and verisimilitudinous artifact.  This, it is argued, is accomplished as part of a more general strategy of depoliticizing the disaster event, legitimating social institutions, (especially those connected with the medical profession), ameliorating anxieties by elaborating fantasies of omnipotence and control, and thenceforth acting as a sensitizing narrative archetype.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, A.

Crosses between diploid and tetraploid individuals of the same genotype can result in F1 lethality, and this dosage-sensitive incompatibility plays a role in polyploid speciation. We have identified variation in F1 lethality in interploidy crosses of Arabidopsis thaliana and determined the genetic architecture of the maternally expressed variation via QTL mapping. A single large-effect QTL, DR. STRANGELOVE 1 (DSL1), was identified as well as two QTL with epistatic relationships to DSL1. DSL1 affects the rate of postzygotic lethality via expression in the maternal sporophyte. Fine mapping placed DSL1 in an interval encoding the maternal effect transcription factor TTG2. Maternal parents carrying loss-of-function mutations in TTG2 suppressed the F1 lethality caused by paternal excess interploidy crosses. The frequency of cellularization in the endosperm was similarly affected by both natural variation and ttg2 loss-of-function mutants. The simple genetic basis of the natural variation and effects of single-gene mutations suggests that F1 lethality in polyploids could evolve rapidly. Furthermore, the role of the sporophytically active TTG2 gene in interploidy crosses indicates that the developmental programming of the mother regulates the viability of interploidy hybrid offspring.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dilkes, Brian P.","Spielman, Melissa","Weizbauer, Renate","Watson, Brian","Burkart-Waco, Diana","Scott, Rod J.","Comai, Luca"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2810841,"sim:weight":0.520668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.131567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An iridium catalyst has been shown to be effective for the selective rearrangement of aldoximes into primary amides. In addition, an iridium-catalysed oxidation of activated alcohols via hydrogen transfer has been developed using an alkene as formal oxidant. These reactions have been combined in a sequential process affording good yields for a range of benzylic alcohols. \r\nAn improved system for the rearrangement of aldoximes into amides using a new ruthenium catalyst is described in Chapter 3. Through a systematic program of optimisation excellent selectivity was achieved for a wide range of substrates at markedly reduced catalyst loading.\r\nChapter 4 describes the development of a ruthenium-catalysed elimination reaction for the conversion of oxime ethers into nitriles. The application of this reaction to tandem and sequential reactions has been explored, albeit with limited success. Also, a method for the ruthenium-catalysed oxidation of alcohols using an electron-deficient alkene as hydrogen acceptor is described, and its application to a tandem oxidation process with a nitrogen nucleophile demonstrated.\r\nAs an extension of the concept presented in Chapter 4, tandem oxidation processes with oxygen nucleophiles are the subject of Chapter 5. This strategy has been used for the oxidation of primary alcohols to their corresponding methyl esters in one-pot, with good yields obtained for a range of substrates. The use of water as a nucleophile in such a process has also been examined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Owston, Nathan Ashley"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2803417,"sim:weight":0.381291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is initially achieved by simply providing adjustments to allow, for example, changes that occur in pack sizes to be accommodated, through user settings or complete sets of change parts. By the appropriate use of these abilities most variations in product can be handled. However when extreme conditions of setups, major changes in product size and configuration, are considered there is no guarantee that the existing machines are able to cope. The problem is even more difficult to deal with when completely new product families are proposed to be made on an existing product line. Such changes in product range are becoming more common as producers respond to demands for ever increasing customization and product differentiation. An issue exists due to the lack of knowledge on the capabilities of the machines being employed. This often forces the producer to undertake a series of practical product trials. These however can only be undertaken once the product form has been decided and produced in sufficient numbers. There is then little opportunity to make changes that could greatly improve the potential output of the line and reduce waste. There is thus a need for a supportive modelling approach that allows the effect of variation in products to be analyzed together with an understanding of the manufacturing machine capability. Only through their analysis and interaction can the capabilities be fully understood and refined to make production possible. This thesis presents a constraint-based approach that offers a solution to the problems above. While employing this approach it has been shown that, a generic process can be formed to identify the limiting factors (constraints) of variant products to be processed. These identified constraints can be mapped to form the potential limits of performance for the machine. The limits of performance of a system (performance envelopes) can be employed to assess the design capability to cope with product variation. The approach is successfully demonstrated on three industrial case studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Matthews, Jason Anthony"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1574764,"sim:weight":0.484239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54103,"sim:weight":0.346721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.314539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59232,"sim:weight":0.294076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.240034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular this study explores the Cypriot primary school teachers’ understanding of professional development; their engagement in and understanding of reflective practice; the changes brought about in practice through reflective practice; the factors associated with these changes; and the extent to which Cypriot primary school teachers set themselves long term goals for professional development as an outcome of reflection. The study is qualitative and uses semi-structured interviews in which 18 Cypriot primary school teachers describe and explain their experiences and illustrate these with examples from their practice. The analysis of the interviews revealed that Cypriot primary school teachers perceive professional development as the receipt of knowledge from an official authority, mainly the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC). Whereas the Cypriot primary school teachers use reflective practice to compare their practice with performance outcomes, comparison of their practice with espoused beliefs is either ignored or limited. Espoused beliefs are only analysed through reflective practice in relation to teaching methods. The study reveals how changes in practice, which are brought about as an outcome of reflective practice, are associated with the following factors: a) length of teaching experience; b) theories in use which can either restrict or promote the critical examination of practice and change; c) the kind of professional exchange in which the teachers engage. In addition a mismatch emerged between the Cypriot primary school teachers’ views of reflection and their long term goals for professional development. This study concludes by discussing the implications of the findings and suggests ways in which Cypriot primary school teachers can be encouraged to recognize the knowledge which they develop from their own practice and to increase their understanding and use of reflective practice. It also identifies the need for changes in the organizational environments in Cypriot primary schools in order to support the developmental needs of its teachers including the reconsideration of the dual role of inspectors who are responsible for both professional development and evaluation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Loizou, Florentia"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108075,"sim:weight":0.347746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27527,"sim:weight":0.325249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.294089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821113,"sim:weight":0.291362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.181981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These disallowed ranges of frequency are known as photonic band gaps. The intentional introduction of defects into the crystal gives rise to localized electromagnetic states that provide a mechanism for the control of the propagation of photons through PhCs. In the case of one dimensional (1-D) PhCs, the introduction of a single defect into a finite PhC results in the formation of a resonant cavity structure, a so-called microcavity. The ease of fabrication and scope for integration make 1-D PhCs good candidates for the future applications of PhCs in light transmission systems and, as such, these structures are the focus of the research reported here. The aim of this thesis is to report a practical study of passive 1-D PhC devices and thereby extend the base of measurements that support and extend the results of theory and simulation. Various types of 1-D PhC structures have been fabricated using electron beam lithography and inductively coupled plasma technologies in a clean-room environment. The fabricated structures in effect demonstrate a first or primitive level of integration of 1-D PhCs with another optical device, namely a ridge waveguide. Measurements were performed by butt-coupling from a single mode fibre taper of the transmission characteristics of the resulting integrated waveguides, whilst a Side-band measurement method for very high resolution (0.2pm) microcavity characterisation was invented during the measurement process. A multiple wavelength transmission optical filter transmitting at the telecommunication wavelengths of 1310nm and 1550nm, and which could be used in a WDM system was demonstrated. The effect of introducing mode matching structures to minimize II the scattering loss and boost the quality factor value was investigated. Optimum positioning of the tapers produced a significant enhancement of Q. Finally, a narrow pass band filter constructed from coupled cavities was fabricated and characterised. A quasi-flat transmission peak with a pass band width of just 4nm was observed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shi, Xiaohua"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1394271,"sim:weight":0.328701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26181,"sim:weight":0.239078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23394,"sim:weight":0.233879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26191,"sim:weight":0.214627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26656,"sim:weight":0.211743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.211127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268952,"sim:weight":0.205034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22901,"sim:weight":0.203872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584826,"sim:weight":0.197804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28907,"sim:weight":0.192369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512830,"sim:weight":0.190519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.178789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26193,"sim:weight":0.178482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26240,"sim:weight":0.162825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28584,"sim:weight":0.146011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Most research into parental choice of school has been conducted in quasi-markets; markets that are highly regulated by government policy. The Taiwanese preschool market could be said to be a true market, operating through supply and demand and regulated by price. How parents operate in such markets and how their choice influences what is offered, is less explored. The research consisted of following eighteen parents through the choice process. Data collection methods involved diaries completed before the child started preschool and two in-depth interviews; one at the beginning of the school year and one nine months later. The parents who supplied the information came from different educational backgrounds, social status and family structures. For most it was their first experience of choosing an educational setting for their children. Using a rational choice theoretical framework the thesis argues that there was certain rationality in the parents’ process of choice but balancing the benefits and costs of preschool education was embedded in a wider family context. In addition, the findings show that whilst the parents were initially concerned about the more structural aspects of quality, their on-going engagement with the preschool provision enabled them to have a deeper understanding of process issues. However, there were other criteria that the parents used which would suggest that they were defining quality in a way that may be more influenced by Taiwanese life and culture. One implication is that the quality of preschool provision is not likely to improve if it is purely dependent on preschools wishing to meet the parents’expectations. However, neither will it improve if the contextual conditions are ignored. The implications for Taiwanese government preschool policy are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hsieh, Chia-Yin"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109102,"sim:weight":0.398635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99933,"sim:weight":0.301472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.285445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.269394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.267148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.252456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85361,"sim:weight":0.249606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.248953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.24003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109179,"sim:weight":0.235291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.231672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.223269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654845,"sim:weight":0.219882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.198173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Through the literature review it has been identified that higher education is globally expanding. Competing knowledgebased economies with higher education institutions have led education to be considered a market commodity and consequently the marketization of higher education in competitive world markets. This is exemplified by discussion of the United Kingdom higher education policies and the resulting demand for higher education in the United Kingdom. The numbers of overseas students studying at higher education institutions in the United Kingdom is rising, with a notable increase in the number of students from South-East Asia. In its endeavour to increase its knowledge-based economy, Thailand has increased opportunities for Thai nationals to study overseas through scholarships and Government policies. The advantages of overseas degrees to individuals, these include a facility with English language, enhanced employment and promotion prospects, and increased social status, are discussed. A study of Thai students studying in the United Kingdom has been used to explore the reality of these advantages for individual students. A case study approach was used and personal interviews with students and questionnaires with their parents and grandparents. The data was analysed using a ‘categorical-content perspective’ narrative method (Lieblich et al., 1998). The thesis concludes that, despite as a nation Thailand having good geographical links with other advanced countries such as Japan and China, living in an economically stable and democratic country, having excellent opportunities to access Thai universities and having no direct links with the United Kingdom, Thai students still see real advantages to studying at higher education institutions in the United Kingdom. This decision is influenced by social and cultural factors, in particular the extended family, and potential financial rewards. However as a result of studying overseas in the United Kingdom the Thai students experience and have to resolve various social and cultural tensions. They have become more individualistic in their attitudes and opinions, which are at odds with the traditional collectivist values, held by their families and deeply entrenched in Thai society.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tarry, Estelle F."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As a result, it would appear that the need for schools to be able to market themselves within this culture was becoming more and more important. One of the key elements of an effective marketing strategy is the notion of ‘brand’. Consequently, this study explores the concept of brand within the environment of Primary education in the UK. In particular, it investigates the importance of an effective vision for generating a notion of brand within the school and the effects that this manifests. The research is conducted by using an Action Research methodology in which the researcher also assumed the role of consultant. This presented many potentially conflicting situations particularly with a view to maintaining validity and reliability. It was done by carrying out a sixteen month investigation into brand development within a primary school in the south-east of England. The results were obtained by a combination of ongoing data collection, questionnaire responses from school staff and interviews with a representative group of school staff. The focus of the research was potentially vast but was narrowed to an investigation of the relationship between vision and brand, the main component aspects of embedding a brand and an investigation into the effects of this on school staff. As a result, a model was developed to summarise the findings and present a potential methodology for subsequent research and development. The main findings were that a focus on brand development within the school, through the promotion and development of an effective vision, led to a greater sense of unity within the school staff, greater levels of staff engagement and motivation and a more positive atmosphere within the school.","bibo:AuthorList":["Baber, Jon"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8821113,"sim:weight":0.397218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85403,"sim:weight":0.33374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.215402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.198522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53666,"sim:weight":0.177532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I explore this theory through ‘story’ as a methodology that connects both the creative writer and action researcher, and raises questions about self, reflective process and voice that are central to my enquiry. In telling these stories, I ask the question: what does it mean to be creative, as a writer, an educator and a manager? Is the nature of creativity transferable across each of these roles? How has this knowledge improved my practice as an educator? My examination leads to a theory of learning called ‘knowledge transformation’, which suggests that deep learning leads to change of both the learner and what is learnt. My premise is that ‘knowledge transformation’ involves the capacity to respond to challenge, self and other, and is central to the notion of creativity. I consider how far this capacity can be transferable, teachable and measurable in educational contexts, arriving at a notion of ‘scaffolded creativity’ which is demonstrated through practice in the higher academy. My journey towards and with this theory draws on my experience of four personae, the creative writer in and outside the academy, and the educator, team leader, and researcher within it; and explores the strategies and issues raised by bringing these roles and intelligences together. This theory of ‘knowledge transformation’ represents an aspirational contribution to our understanding of what it means to be ‘creative’. It explores how educational objectives can lead to deep learning and positive change. It also explores how values can be clarified in the course of their emergence and formed into living standards of judgment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spiro, Jane Roberta"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The first phase involved researching the current decontamination methods applied in UK hospital pharmacies, which manipulate cytotoxic drugs. The second phase evaluated practical decontamination methods, and the third phase investigated one intervention aimed at reducing or preventing contamination occurring in an isolator. A questionnaire was sent out to ASU managers in NHS hospital pharmacies to gain information about the disinfection and decontamination procedures and products used. The practical decontamination methods investigated were mechanical removal and degradation by detergents (pH range from 1.7 - 13.2) and cleaning agents, and degradation by vaporised hydrogen peroxide. Analytical methods were developed and validated to recover and quantify the amount of cytotoxic marker drug remaining after the decontamination tests carried out in phase two, and to recover and quantify cytotoxic surface contamination from various surfaces in phase three of this work. This composed an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of a closed-system e.g. PhaSeal® device for fluid-transfer, in reducing contamination produced from the compounding of cytotoxic drugs in an isolator. The detergents and cleaning agents were effective in removing or reducing cytotoxic surface contamination. Alkaline detergents caused degradation of doxorubicin (maximum 81% at pH 13.2 after 1 hour exposure); the other detergents tested did not xi x degrade the cytotoxic drugs investigated. Exposure to vaporised hydrogen peroxide (1.6g min-1 for 2 hours) caused the degradation of cyclophosphamide (98.9%), 5-Fluorouracil (29.3%), doxorubicin (71.0%) and epirubicin (65.9%) when exposed in pharmaceutical diluents. The closed-system (PhaSeal®) device was effective in reducing contamination produced in an isolator from the compounding of cytotoxic drugs. The risk posed by handling and manipulation of cytotoxic drugs and products to the operator and the environment may be reduced, if not eliminated by considering additional approaches to the methods already in place. Firstly, the application of effective decontamination methods; and secondly, by using an effective closed-system, for example the PhaSeal® drug transfer device in a controlled environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roberts, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.147184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26546,"sim:weight":0.10315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recent experiments on Cobalt-Platinum multilayers containing artificially created domains provide the motivation for this work. In this thesis the electronic structure of CoPt multilayers are calculated by an ab initio multiple scattering method, and attempts are made at replicating the systems used in experiments, including lattice relaxations and the effects of substitutional alloying. The magnetic reversal process in Pt/Co/Pt trilayer systems is studied in the framework of micromagnetics, in which effects such as exchange, magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the demagnetising field are treated phenomenologically. The results are compared to recent experiments and the switching mechanism can be understood in terms of domain growth and domain wall nucleation. A ballistic transport framework is outlined in terms of a tight binding Green function method. The domain wall is modelled as a change in the local spin reference frame. The method is applied to Cobalt Platinum trilayers, and it is found that the resulting domain wall resistances are sensitive to the details of the Fermi energy bands. Subsequently, the angular dependence of domain wall resistivity in Pt/Co/Pt systems is studied by a model based on the anisotropic resistivity tensor that is expected in a domain wall. The results are used to extract resistivity parameters from experimental data, and a positive domain wall resistivity is identified, whilst resulting arguments provide supporting evidence for the Levy-Zhang theory of domain wall resistance. Finally, recent experiments on the dilute magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As have provided evidence for a negative intrinsic domain wall resistance in this material. By applying a similar model to that used on the CoPt systems, it is shown that the anomalous magnetoresistance effect can also provide a significant negative contribution to the measured resistance via induced eddy current at the domain wall boundary.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roberts, Hywei Gwynedd"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These challenges are 1) universities do not produce highly qualified and industrially relevant graduates, 2) universities do not understand and accommodate the nature of industry, 3) universities do not have sufficient resources, 4) universities are not recognized as a critical player in economy, and 5) universities do not seriously cooperate among themselves and with other related sectors. To deal with the challenges above and to enhance universities’ competitiveness/ relevance in the automotive industry, my study recommends that universities could be improved by establishing a track record, culture and strategic plan to enhance trust and mutual recognition from the Thai automotive cluster. It is this trust and recognition that could lead to collaboration and eventually transform the automotive cluster into a knowledge-based and competitive cluster. In the longer-term, universities that adopt a mission to serve industry should be developed to become an effective component of the ‘triple helix’ or an entrepreneurial university by 1) committing themselves towards collaboration with industry and other players for mutual benefit and industrial growth, 2) understanding the demands and culture of industry, 3) developing niche technology and translating this into patents/licensing, 4) providing consultancy and collaborating with industry and government through an entrepreneurial spirit, 5) supporting business incubation services and spin-offs, 6) enhancing continuity of cooperative and entrepreneurship education, 7) recruiting and developing industrially-experienced and research-active staff, and 8) accommodating competitive facilities for R\u0026D. In addition, a governmental intermediate organization (such as Thailand Automotive Institute) should be identified as the central organization in improving competitiveness of the cluster that should be given greater autonomy and flexibility to support the coopetition of different players with greater efficiency and effectiveness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mongkhonvanit, Jomphong"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Pro-Vice Chancellors (PVCs) are members of these teams, normally with significant responsibility for activities that are integral to the university, but very little is known about their role and the importance that connections to others might play in it. Taking a social network perspective, this thesis investigates this gap using a two stage research design. First an electronically distributed questionnaire was used to determine the connectivity between PVCs either with responsibility for research or with responsibility for teaching from the original 16 UK universities of the 1994 Group. Secondly, semistructured interviews were conducted with eight PVCs from four of these universities, to examine similarities and differences in the roles of different PVCs and the importance of connectivity for them. Network maps showed that research PVCs were cohesively linked; most were connected to at least two others, and often to many more. Conversely, PVCs with responsibility for teaching were almost wholly unconnected. Connections to other PVCs served three purposes. Occasionally they were important for personal development, otherwise they either enabled PVCs to perform her/his duties by providing information, or enhanced the performance of the university by allowing access to additional resources. It is concluded that PVCs play a boundary spanning role both internally and externally to the University. Moreover, enduring connections to other PVCs formed where opportunities existed to pursue additional resources collaboratively or when it was necessary to lobby government to protect the existing resource base from others. It was argued that these circumstances commonly occurred in the research environment but not in the teaching environment and so the observed pattern of connectivity amongst PVCs was explained.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pilbeam, Colin James"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25914,"sim:weight":0.184147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108607,"sim:weight":0.181682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.16269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.158636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.128959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The iontophoretic delivery of Dex-Phos was studied, in vitro, in order to evaluate the effects of competing ions and electroosmosis, and identify the optimal conditions for its delivery. The iontophoretic extraction of AAs from the skin was first studied in vitro, before evaluating the method in a group of human volunteers. Dex-Phos was best delivered by iontophoresis from the cathode in absence of background electrolyte in the drug solution. In this situation, the delivery of Dex-Phos is limited principally by the competition with counter-ions (mainly Na+) present subdermally and the small mobility of the drug inside the membrane. The accumulation of Cl-, released by the Ag/AgCl cathode in the drug solution during current passage, can also reduce Dex-Phos delivery. The extraction of zwitterionic AAs from the skin during iontophoresis was highly influenced by their presence in the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum (SC). In the pig skin model, the amount of the AAs extracted during a short extraction period (1 hour) correlated with their abundance in the SC. Once this ‘reservoir’ was emptied (after ~3 hours of iontophoresis), the subdermal compartment could be sampled, suggesting that the method could be used to monitor systemic levels of AAs. The experiments in human volunteers revealed, however, that a 4-hour iontophoretic extraction period was insufficient to deplete the AAs SC ‘reservoir’. It follows that the method can be used to evaluate the abundance of AAs in the SC, but is unpractical for the clinical monitoring of their systemic levels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sylvestre, Jean Philippe"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5841784,"sim:weight":0.37737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2804588,"sim:weight":0.331522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2813441,"sim:weight":0.289887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573409,"sim:weight":0.282915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2804665,"sim:weight":0.268281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2804626,"sim:weight":0.263904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1581132,"sim:weight":0.250589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.154545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.153081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Chapter 1 introduced the idea that infections, both acute and chronic, were risk factors for stroke. Various infections and micro-organisms associated with stroke were discussed. Specifically, the relationship between micro-organisms such as Cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter pylori, dental pathogens, and stroke were discussed. The theories of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis were presented. Chapter 1 also reviewed the association between Chlamydia pneumoniae, an atypical respiratory pathogen, and atherosclerosis in detail. Chapter 2 introduced the ‘Chlamydia pneumoniae in elderly patients with stroke’ or ‘C-PEPS’ study from which published works in subsequent chapters of this thesis were based. The C-PEPS was a case-control study that investigated the seroprevalence of C pneumoniae in 100 elderly acute stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) patients versus 87 control medical patients. The C-PEPS study showed a high seroprevalence (immunoglobulin IgG) of C pneumoniae infection in both cases and controls. There was no significant association between C pneumoniae seropositivity and stroke / TIA. Chapter 3 presented a study that investigated the reproducibility of a commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (SeroCP, Savyon) used in the CPEPS study. The study concluded that SeroCP ELISA had a good reproducibility for the detection of C pneumoniae IgA and moderately good reproducibility for C pneumoniae IgG and IgM. In chapter 4, the ‘Mycoplasma pneumoniae in elderly patients with stroke’ or ‘MPEPS’ case-control study was based on the same cohort of patients as in the C-PEPS study. The M-PEPS study showed a high seroprevalence of M pneumoniae, another atypical respiratory pathogen, in the cohort. However, the study had ruled out M pneumoniae as a major risk factor for stroke / TIA. In chapter 5, the ‘Legionella pneumophila in elderly patients with stroke’ or ‘L-PEPS’ was another case-control study based on the same cohort of patients as in the C-PEPS 3 study. The L-PEPS study established that there was no statistical difference between the seroprevalence of L pneumophila, another atypical respiratory pathogen, in both the stroke / TIA patients and control medical patients. However, when the results of C-PEPS, M-PEPS and L-PEPS studies were analysed together, it appeared that the aggregate number or infectious burden of chronic atypical respiratory infections was associated with the risk of stroke / TIA. Chapter 6 presented a pilot study that investigated the seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii, another atypical respiratory pathogen, in the same cohort of patients as in the C-PEPS study. Due to very low seropositivity and zero counts, a conclusion could not be made on any association between C burnetii seropositivity and stroke / TIA. Chapter 7 presented the electrocardiographic findings such as rhythms and ischaemic changes of the same cohort of patients as in the C-PEPS study. Atrial fibrillation was the commonest rhythm abnormality in both elderly stroke / TIA cases and medical controls. After adjusment for background history of ischaemic heart disease, there was a statistical trend to suggest an association between ischaemic elctrocardiographic changes and stroke / TIA. Chapter 8 presented a case-control study that investigated the relationsips between socioeconomic deprivation (SED) status, atypical respiratory infections and survival outcome in the same cohort of patients as in the C-PEPS study. The SED status of stroke / TIA cases and controls were similar. Although an association between acute atypical respiratory infection and SED was only found in the control medical patients, acute atypical respiratory infectious burden was found to associate with income deprivation in the whole cohort of elderly stroke / TIA and medical patients. SED on its own had only a modest effect on the association between chronic atypical respiratory infectious burden and stroke / TIA. Elderly patients’ duration of survival after an acute stroke / TIA appeared not to be affected by their background SED status. Chapter 9 was the concluding chapter. The main findings of the published works submitted for the thesis were summarised and discussed. Some directions for future research were also discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ngeh, Joseph Kho Tong"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.203694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25874,"sim:weight":0.176774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26486,"sim:weight":0.152768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23872,"sim:weight":0.152768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.102921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":2800915,"ep:Repository":82,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Private returns to education: earnings, health and well-being","bibo:abstract":"This thesis is focused on economic returns to education in China. It takes education as a key point to develop three aspects: earnings returns to education, the influence of education as one of the social-economic factors associated with the Body Mass Index (BMI) related to health, and the determinants of subjective well-being. A panel databased analysis including continuous and discrete dependent variables (ordered probit/probit) is used in this research. The first part examines the earnings returns to education in urban China for four years covering the period 1989 to 2000. We find, in common, with others that such returns were small in 1989, but have increased steadily since then. We also find that the returns for women exceed those for men and go some way to reducing the gender earnings gap. Crucially, however the returns to education decline with the length of time since the individual left school which is consistent with the hypothesis that education enhances ability and skills which in turn enhances earnings, but that the value of such skills deteriorates over time. Finally we find evidence for gravity effects by which earnings decline as distance from Beijing, and more noticeable, Shanghai increases. The aim of the second part is to examine the impact of socio-economic status (SES) on the BMI, a formula based on the ratio of height to weight, linked to health, using a fouryear (1991, 1993, 1997 and 2000) panel data set. To an extent we confirm the results with respect to the linkage between SES and health found for other countries. However, instead of using the existing specification of BMI, we explore the healthy BMI range based on a self-reported measure of health in China. This leads to a slightly different formulation for the BMI and a substantially different healthy range. We also find that this healthy BMI has a significant impact on health together with SES. Because of potential simultaneity between education and health we estimate a relationship between SES and health change. We find a significant relationship between education and changes in health status. The final part studies both happiness and life satisfaction in mainland China. We explore the extent to which SES and social capital influence subjective well-being. The results for happiness and life satisfaction are similar, but not identical. To an extent we confirm the results of others with respect to other countries. Hence we find a U-shaped relationship with respect to age and positive influences of income and health on well-being. We also include a variable which reflects the degree of choice/control over their lives people feel they have. Crucially, for social capital variables, we find that individuals who are involved in more voluntary organizations have higher levels of happiness, and those who are a member of Communist party are also more satisfied with their lives. Finally, education has a limited positive impact on subjective well-being, however, it is also the most significant determinant of social capital variables across individuals. In the thesis we specifically discuss the problem of endogeneity which is traditionally tackled by the use of some instrumental variable method. Recently much of the work in this genre including work relating to education, has been criticised from the perspective of weak instruments. Throughout we suggest alternative approaches and each is specific to the context in which it is used. Each of these alternatives is in itself based on certain assumptions which can in turn be questioned. Their value lies more in that they present extra evidence on the impact of education, rather than they unambiguously provide a solution to the endogeneity problem. Economics is not an exact science and it is the accumulation of evidence which is important. In our case our evidence is that education matters, and it matters not just with respect to earnings, and by implication productivity, but also with respect to health and subjective well-being.","bibo:AuthorList":["Qiu, Tian"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930756,"sim:weight":0.323858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.311129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The research was cross-disciplinary bringing findings and perspectives from cognitive psychology to engineering design. The theoretical work undertaken has produced a model to represent how information can be made to work effectively as creative stimuli, inspiring creative ideas that in turn affect the design outputs produced through the creative design process. By combining participation action research with an observational audit, the information-use profiles were constructed for the innovation hub within the associated case company. These gave details of the types of projects and tasks undertaken by the case company; the designers working on them, and most importantly the information being used during design activities. It was shown that over 50% of the information uses recorded were working on diagrammatic representations, predominantly using CAD and imaging software. In this thesis it is shown that information captured, documented and stored by a company can be used as a useful source of creative stimuli. A tool was proposed to retrieve this information in a guided manner to support creative idea generation in industrial brainstorm sessions. The evidence suggested that introducing any of the tested formats of stimuli to a brainstorm group had positive affect on both the rate of idea production and the quality of the ideas being produced. Stimuli sourced internally to the case company in a guided manner were shown to perform as well as the most established creative stimuli tools available.","bibo:AuthorList":["Howard, Thomas James"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1573464,"sim:weight":0.317657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.287401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108269,"sim:weight":0.252461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61040,"sim:weight":0.236459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.229531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000432,"sim:weight":0.213109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.197339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Chapter 1 introduces the background to phosphine ligands, their properties, interactions with transition metals and applications. The chapter then discusses macrocyclic and medium ring P,N-containing ligands, as well as some water soluble phosphines. The chapter also introduces the novel self-assembled macrocyclic phosphine complex [FeL1(H2O)2]SO4 (1) and its tetradentate cyclic phosphine ligand L1. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of [FeL1(H2O)2]SO4 (1) and its coordination chemistry with a variety of ligands, including halides, pseudo-halides, and CO. 57Fe labelled versions of complex 1 and the related dicarbonyl complex [FeL1(H2O)2]SO4 (9) were synthesised as models for the hydrogenase protein Hmd in a Nuclear Resonance Vibrational Spectroscopy study. Reactions were also undertaken to functionalise the hydroxymethyl groups in order to alter the properties of the complexes. The reaction of 1 with acetic anhydride afforded complex [Fe(L2)(k2-O2SO2)] (13), possessing the acylated ligand L2 and a coordinated sulfate ligand. The coordination chemistry of 13 was explored with a variety of neutral and anionic ligands, including halides, pseudohalides, carbonate, and CO. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetric investigations of L1 and L2 complexes were also explored. Chapter 3 reports the investigations carried out to explore the effect of altering the reagents of the self-assembly reaction. The self-assembly reaction to synthesise complex 1 was also attempted with copper(II), nickel(II), copper(II) and zinc(II) salts, as well as in the absence of a metal template, which all did not lead to the formation of any isolable species. The syntheses of the novel iron(II) complexes [Fe(L3)2(SO4)] (23) and cis-[Fe(L3)2Cl2] (24a) containing the new bidentate phosphine ligand L3 are also reported, as well as the coordination chemistry of 24a with a variety of ligands. The reaction of 24a with NaBH4 gave the trans hydride-chloride complex trans-[Fe(L3)2(H)Cl] (29). Electrochemical investigations of the L3 complexes were also carried out.

Existing business-to-business segmentation literature demonstrates the necessity to balance diverse customer needs with the capabilities and resources of competing organisations in the marketplace, but there are also known problems associated with it. The researcher was employed in Eatec for the duration of the two-year case study research. Action research was adopted to monitor the development of the strategic marketing planning and segmentation process. Whilst a structured approach to the strategic marketing and segmentation process was encouraged, the researcher demonstrated pitfalls in adopting a structured approach to the decision making process when evaluating and selecting market sectors. Integrating all elements of marketing activities into one process was recognised to be important for success. The directors had previously used the notion of intuition in isolation. The introduction of a strategic marketing and segmentation plan encouraged the directors to use information gained from internal and external environmental analysis, as well as marketing intelligence to substantiate their ‘gut-feel’. This led to the requirement for an appropriate evaluation and selection method which has to be intuitively appealing without it being too structured or restrictive. At the individual level of each company, it is the defined company objectives and business strategies that determine the appropriate segmentation approach, but common elements exist to all companies. The researcher believes that a structured process helps to pull different tasks from different business areas together in one process. It is the balance of these elements that makes a segmentation process unique to each company. The research concludes that segmentation activities should be integrated into a structured strategic marketing plan but the complex decision making process that happens during segmentation, in contrast should be less structured. By using multi-criteria decision making in a measured approach, the value of experience and intuition can be incorporated in conjunction with market intelligence when evaluating between equally favourable market sectors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cheng, Lindsay"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109099,"sim:weight":0.315963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The actual site of action of the avermectins on the GluCl is unclear, but binding studies have concluded that it does not share a binding site with glutamate. The GluCl channels have been well characterised in Caenorhabditis elegans and are beginning to be characterised in parasitic nematode species such as Haemonchus contortus, Dirofilaria immitis and Cooperia oncophora. The aim of this project was to characterise the H. contortus GluClα3B subunit and its interactions with agonists, glutamate and ivermectin using electrophysiology to study Xenopus oocytes expressing GluClα3B homomeric channels and ligand binding studies on COS-7 cells expressing the subunits. Site–directed mutagenesis was used to introduce resistance associated candidate polymorphisms into the H. contortus GluClα3B subunit. The effects of these changes on the response to glutamate and ivermectin were assessed. One mutation found in IVR C. oncophora, L256F, confers a 3-fold loss of sensitivity to glutamate and a 6.5 fold loss of sensitivity to IVM. This mutation is found in the C-terminal area of the extracellular region of the channel and, from homology modelling, we know it lies in close proximity and possibly interferes with another candidate mutation V235A, and the Cysteine residue at position 192 which forms one side of the structurally significant disulphide bridge. Further introduction of different mutations at this position showed the larger the substituted amino acid, the greater the effect on IVM sensitivity. Another amino acid substitution (T300S) results in the prohibition of a functional channel. The protein is produced and is able to bind IVM with high affinity but does not create a functional channel. These data show that polymorphisms found in field isolates of parasites can have a significant effect on GluCl channels and may contribute to drug resistance.","bibo:AuthorList":["McCavera, Samantha J.

The first experimental part tests the ability of our novel lipospermines in NVGT, this includes structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies changing the: position, length, saturation or symmetry of the fatty chains of N4,N9-diacyl, N1,N12-diacyl and N4,N9-dialkyl spermines. The ability of these lipospermines in DNA condensation is investigated using ethidium bromide fluorescence-quenching, and gel electrophoresis (including gel shift and DNase protection) assays followed by nanoparticle characterization techniques (particle size and zeta potential). Transfection efficiency of pEGFP (using FACS) and cytotoxicity (using MTT) were studied in both cancer and primary cell lines and compared with Lipogen™ (N4,N9-dioleoyl spermine). Some of these novel lipospermines are shown to be as good as, but not better than N4,N9-dioleoyl spermine as efficient DNA transfecting agents. N4,N9-Dioleoyl spermine is the best transfecting agent from the all tested novel lipospermines displaying the lowest N/P ratio, highest transfection efficiency and the lowest cytotoxicity on both tested cell lines.

We explored a model for Sox10 function in melanophores, based upon a model for Sox10’s role in mouse sympathetic neurons (Kim et al. 2003), and tested the following predictions: as well as inducing expression of mitfa, Sox10 will repress expression of genes downstream of Mitfa thus, Sox10 must be downregulated, via Mitfa, to allow melanophore differentiation. We observed derepression of melanophore marker genes in sox10t3 mutants, supporting the hypothesis that Sox10 represses these genes in wild type melanophores. We documented Sox10/sox10 downregulation in developing melanophores and generated transgenic lines to test whether this is necessary for differentiation. Unfortunately our experimental lines did not express our transgene so we were unable to test this hypothesis. However, transgenic lines, generated as controls, which express CFP in melanophores or xanthophores will be useful tools in their own right. Finally we conducted RNA injection experiments to explore regulation of melanophore genes by Sox10 and Mitfa. We found that injection of mitfa induces expression of all our melanophore markers whereas co-injection of mitfa and sox10 does not. We also found that the 7.2 kb sox10 promoter contains six Mitf binding sites and is Mitfa responsive. Our data broadly support our original model but also suggest that it does not describe the complete network. We propose a modified model for the role of Sox10 in the genetic regulatory network controlling melanophore development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greenhill, Emma Rachel"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1577121,"sim:weight":0.341871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.110343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.0975536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.0915705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Mutation of the transcription factor SOX10 is associated with several human diseases. The disease phenotypes reflect the function of SOX10 in diverse tissues including the neural crest, central nervous system and otic vesicle. As expected, the SOX10 expression pattern is complex and highly dynamic, but little is known of the underlying mechanisms regulating its spatiotemporal pattern. SOX10 expression is highly conserved between all vertebrates characterised.\r\n\r\nResults:  We have combined in vivo testing of DNA fragments in zebrafish and computational comparative genomics to identify the first regulatory regions of the zebrafish sox10 gene. Both approaches converged on the 3\u0027 end of the conserved 1st intron as being critical for spatial patterning of sox10 in the embryo. Importantly, we have defined a minimal region crucial for this function. We show that this region contains numerous binding sites for transcription factors known to be essential in early neural crest induction, including Tcf/Lef, Sox and FoxD3. We show that the identity and relative position of these binding sites are conserved between zebrafish and mammals. A further region, partially required for oligodendrocyte expression, lies in the 5\u0027 region of the same intron and contains a putative CSL binding site, consistent with a role for Notch signalling in sox10 regulation. Furthermore, we show that β-catenin, Notch signalling and Sox9 can induce ectopic sox10 expression in early embryos, consistent with regulatory roles predicted from our transgenic and computational results.\r\n\r\nConclusion:  We have thus identified two major sites of sox10 regulation in vertebrates and provided evidence supporting a role for at least three factors in driving sox10 expression in neural crest, otic epithelium and oligodendrocyte domains.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dutton, J","Antonellis, A","Carney, T.

Benefits and tax credits aim to provide protection against economic risks, help families with the costs of bringing up children, enable people to save for retirement, and provide support in old age. Key goals are to redistribute income to alleviate poverty and help people maintain living standards across the life course. Reform of the social security and tax systems has been at the heart of the UK Labor government\u0027s aspirations to modernize the welfare state since 1997 with major changes in both policy and administration. This second edition of the important text, Understanding Social Security, reviews these policy developments, giving readers the information and analytical tools to make sense of policy debates and reforms and to evaluate options for the future. The chapters have been extensively updated since the first edition, with new chapters on social security reform, inequalities and social security, and the new \u0027welfare market\u0027. The main topics covered include: the social security safety net; racism, ethnicity, migration; social security governance; global social security; social security and the life course; the challenge of childhood poverty; reforming pensions; welfare to work; sickness, incapacity and disability; tax credits; service delivery; and, information technology. The book provides a critical examination of social security policy and practice and is essential reading for students of social policy, social work and sociology, as well as policy-makers and practitioners in the fields of social security, welfare-to-work, employment, anti-poverty strategies and welfare rights. It will be of interest to those interested in recent policy developments in these areas, emerging issues and debates, and in wider issues of the modernization of the welfare state.","bibo:AuthorList":["Millar, Jane"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9425266,"sim:weight":0.340438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Image reconstruction in ECT is a nonlinear ill posed inverse problem, and regularization methods are needed to stabilize this inverse problem. Reconstruction of complex shapes (sharp edges) and absolute permittivity values are more difficult task in ECT and the commonly used regularization methods in Tikhonov minimization are unable to solve these problems. In the standard Tikhonov regularization method, the regularization matrix has a Laplacian type structure, which encourages smoothing reconstruction. A Helmholtz type regularization scheme has been implemented to solve the inverse problem with complicated shape objects and the absolute permittivity values. The Helmholtz type regularization has a wave like property and encourages variations of permittivity. The results from experimental data demonstrate the advantage of the Helmholtz-type regularization for recovering sharp edges over popular Laplacian type regularization in the framework of Tikhonov minimization. Further, this paper presents the examples of the reconstructed absolute value permittivity map in ECT using experimental phantom data.","bibo:AuthorList":["Soleimani, Manuchehr","Yalavarthy  , P","Dehghani, H"],"dc:date":"2010-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5843034,"sim:weight":0.437459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67787,"sim:weight":0.37962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5590228,"sim:weight":0.265777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827047,"sim:weight":0.234643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69883,"sim:weight":0.155904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147453,"sim:weight":0.113812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67786,"sim:weight":0.107153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931147,"sim:weight":0.104742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20346,"sim:weight":0.0973862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23895,"sim:weight":0.0729579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using whole-genome Bp microarrays, we examined patterns of gene presence and absence across 94 South East Asian strains isolated from a variety of clinical, environmental, or animal sources. 86% of the Bp K96243 reference genome was common to all the strains representing the Bp \"core genome\u0027\u0027, comprising genes largely involved in essential functions (eg amino acid metabolism, protein translation). In contrast, 14% of the K96243 genome was variably present across the isolates. This Bp accessory genome encompassed multiple genomic islands (GIs), paralogous genes, and insertions/deletions, including three distinct lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-related gene clusters. Strikingly, strains recovered from cases of human melioidosis clustered on a tree based on accessory gene content, and were significantly more likely to harbor certain GIs compared to animal and environmental isolates. Consistent with the inference that the GIs may contribute to pathogenesis, experimental mutation of BPSS2053, a GI gene, reduced microbial adherence to human epithelial cells. Our results suggest that the Bp accessory genome is likely to play an important role in microbial adaptation and virulence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sim,  S. H.","Yu,  Y.","Lin,  C. H.","Karuturi,  R. K.

Despite their popularity, the characterisation of polymorphic microsatellite loci and development of suitable markers takes considerable effort. Newly-available genomic databases make it feasible to identify conserved genetic markers. We examined the utility and characteristics of conserved microsatellite markers in Charadriiformes (plovers, sandpipers, gulls and auks). This order harbours many species with diverse breeding systems, life histories and extraordinary migration biology whose genetics warrant investigation. However, research has been largely restrained by the limited availability of genetic markers. To examine the utility of conserved microsatellite loci as genetic markers we collated a database of Charadriiformes microsatellites, searched for homologues in the chicken genome and tested conserved markers for amplification and polymorphism in a range of charadriiform species. Results: Sixty-eight (42%) of 161 charadriiform microsatellite loci were assigned to a single location in the chicken genome based on their E-value. Fifty-five primers designed from conserved microsatellite loci with an E-value of E-10 or lower amplified across a wider range of charadriiform species than a control group of primers from ten anonymous microsatellite loci. Twenty-three of 24 examined conserved markers were polymorphic, each in on average 3 of 12 species tested. Conclusion: Genomic sequence databases are useful tools to identify conserved genetic markers including those located in non-coding regions. By maximising primer sequence similarity between source species and database species, markers can be further improved and provide additional markers to study the molecular ecology of populations of non-model organisms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kupper, C","Burke, T","Szekely, Tamas","Dawson, D.

Methods and Findings: We undertook a study of B. pseudomallei in soil sampled from 100 equally spaced points within 237.5 m(2) of disused land in northeast Thailand. B. pseudomallei was present on direct culture of 77/100 sampling points. Genotyping of 200 primary plate colonies from three independent sampling points was performed using a combination of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Twelve PFGE types and nine sequence types (STs) were identified, the majority of which were present at only a single sampling point. Two sampling points contained four STs and the third point contained three STs. Although the distance between the three sampling points was low (7.6, 7.9, and 13.3 meters, respectively), only two STs were present in more than one sampling point. Each of the three samples was characterized by the localized expansion of a single B. pseudomallei clone (corresponding to STs 185, 163, and 93). Comparison of PFGE and MLST results demonstrated that two STs contained strains with variable PFGE banding pattern types, indicating geographic structuring even within a single MLST-defined clone.

Selection can, however, also act at the RNA level, for example, to facilitate rapid translation or ensure correct splicing. Here, we ask whether the way DNA works also imposes constraints on coding sequence evolution. We identify nucleosome positioning as a likely candidate to set up such a DNA-level selective regime and use high-resolution microarray data in yeast to compare the evolution of coding sequence bound to or free from nucleosomes. Controlling for gene expression and intragene location, we find a nucleosome-free \u0027\u0027linker\u0027\u0027 sequence to evolve on average 5-6% slower at synonymous sites. A reduced rate of evolution in linker is especially evident at the 59 end of genes, where the effect extends to non-synonymous substitution rates. This is consistent with regular nucleosome architecture in this region being important in the context of gene expression control. As predicted, codons likely to generate a sequence unfavourable to nucleosome formation are enriched in linker sequence. Amino acid content is likewise skewed as a function of nucleosome occupancy. We conclude that selection operating on DNA to maintain correct positioning of nucleosomes impacts codon choice, amino acid choice, and synonymous and non-synonymous rates of evolution in coding sequence. The results support the exclusion model for nucleosome positioning and provide an alternative interpretation for runs of rare codons. As the intimate association of histones and DNA is a universal characteristic of genic sequence in eukaryotes, selection on coding sequence composition imposed by nucleosome positioning should be phylogenetically widespread.","bibo:AuthorList":["Warnecke, Tobias","Batada, N.

We successfully tackle the regularity and approximation error issues but proving stability relies on showing that the plane wave expansion\r\nmethod is equivalent to a spectral Galerkin method, and not all of our problems allow this. However, stability is observed in all of our numerical computations.\r\nIt has been proposed in [40], [53], [63] and [64] that replacing the discontinuous coefficients in the problem with smooth coefficients will improve the plane wave expansion method, despite the additional error. Our convergence analysis for the method in[63] and [64] shows that the overall rate of convergence is no faster than before. To define A we need the Fourier coefficients of n(x), and sometimes these must be approximated, thus adding an additional error. We analyse the errors for a method\r\nwhere n(x) is sampled on a uniform grid and the Fourier coefficients are computed with the Fast Fourier Transform. We then devise a strategy for setting the grid-spacing that\r\nwill recover the convergence rate of the plane wave expansion method with exact Fourier coefficients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Norton, Richard"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"R A Norton.

Long stator systems are difficult since it is not possible to butt stator modules against each other. Arguably the simplest and most cost effective winding uses modular construction where the coils are planar and do not overlap. Here the end winding is compact and stator sections can be butted together. However modular windings do not produce high quality travelling fields. Two space harmonics of closely the same magnitude are produced that travel in opposite directions, giving induced currents and opposing forces with little net force in plate rotors. The difficulty can be resolved if a wound secondary with a double layer winding is used instead of a plate. Here a substantial induced emf and current is produced only by the field for which the secondary is wound, so that force is produced only in one direction. The use and properties of modular windings for short rotor machines are explored using finite element analysis and the results are validated by practical tests. It is concluded that inexpensive modular windings can be used with wound secondaries to good effect particularly in long stator situations; for example, for electromagnetic launch and urban transport systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Eastham, F","Cox,  T.","Leonard, Paul","Proverbs,  J."],"dc:date":"2008-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2734349,"sim:weight":0.37251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931543,"sim:weight":0.313069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108918,"sim:weight":0.290273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393482,"sim:weight":0.285514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28486,"sim:weight":0.282978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393475,"sim:weight":0.279544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176817,"sim:weight":0.271319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85528,"sim:weight":0.254121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5842924,"sim:weight":0.249187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86116,"sim:weight":0.222281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108820,"sim:weight":0.170731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1441717,"sim:weight":0.155106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108810,"sim:weight":0.12911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The approach is general in nature, but is applied here to the case of air pollution. It uses a computer model involving ambient pollution and temperature input to simulate the exposures experienced by individuals in an urban area, while incorporating the mechanisms that determine exposures. The output from the model comprises a set of daily exposures for a sample of individuals from the population of interest. These daily exposures are approximated by parametric distributions so that the predictive exposure distribution of a randomly selected individual can be generated. These distributions are then incorporated into a hierarchical Bayesian framework (with inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation) in order to examine the relationship between short-term changes in exposures and health outcomes, while making allowance for long-term trends, seasonality, the effect of potential confounders and the possibility of ecological bias. The paper applies this approach to particulate pollution (PM10) and respiratory mortality counts for seniors in greater London (\u003e\u003d 65 years) during 1997. Within this substantive epidemiological study, the effects on health of ambient concentrations and (estimated) personal exposures are compared. The proposed model incorporates within day (or between individual) variability in personal exposures, which is compared to the more traditional approach of assuming a single pollution level applies to the entire population for each day. Effects were estimated using single lags and distributed lag models, with the highest relative risk, RR \u003d 1.02 (1.01-1.04), being associated with a lag of two days ambient concentrations of PM10. Individual exposures to PM10 for this group (seniors) were lower than the measured ambient concentrations with the corresponding risk, RR \u003d 1.05 (1.01-1.09), being higher than would be suggested by the traditional approach using ambient concentrations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shaddick, Gavin","Lee,  D.","Zidek,  J.

From a systematic search of six electronic databases, 56 original studies were extracted, reporting on 7937 sick and well people. A meta-analysis was conducted on change in QoL from pre- to post-intervention compared with outcomes from a no-exercise control group, using weighted (by the study’s sample size) pooled mean effect sizes and a fixed-effects model.  Significant differences in outcome were found when treatment purpose was compared; prevention/promotion (well populations), rehabilitation, or disease management.  Three to six months post-baseline, a moderate positive effect of exercise interventions was found for overall QoL in rehabilitation patients (effect size [ES] \u003d 0.55), but no significant effect for well or disease management groups (ES \u003d 0.11 and ES \u003d -0.00 respectively).  However, physical and psychological QoL domains improved significantly relative to controls in well participants (ES \u003d 0.22 and ES \u003d 0.21 respectively). Psychological QoL was significantly poorer relative to controls in the disease management group (ES \u003d -0.26).  This pattern of results persisted over one year. With some exceptions, better overall QoL was reported for light intensity exercise undertaken in group settings, with greater improvement in physical QoL following moderate intensity exercise.  The implications for future practice and research are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gillison, Fiona","Skevington, Suzanne","Sato, Ayana","Standage, Martyn","Evangelidou, Stella"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.264616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53278,"sim:weight":0.242758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.241034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.23207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25874,"sim:weight":0.219326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.213042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.17647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24399,"sim:weight":0.173778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.146678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25871,"sim:weight":0.145466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Four decades ago it was suggested that iron may have a crucial role in the progression of inflammation in RA. Indeed, free radicals generated by iron can cause damage to lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and DNA. It is this destructive process that is believed to occur in rheumatoid joints. However, none had differentiated between the role of iron in both acute and chronic phases of the disease and the origin of this \u0027labile\u0027 iron. Since RA cells are chronically exposed to oxidative stress, we have therefore chosen Jurkat cells to be our cell model. We used the parental (J16) cell line was used to mimic the acute phase of oxidative stress and the H2O2-resistant (HJ16) cells to mimic the chronic phase. By using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidising agent, we aim to study the role of iron in acute and chronic phase of oxidative stress and to know its origin. In the present study, we found that both antioxidants and H2O2-induced labile iron are modulated when cells are chronically exposed to H2O2. HJ16 cells contain higher total intracellular glutathione levels and glutathione peroxidase activity than J16 cells while the superoxide dismutase and catalase activity are similar. Haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was not detectable nor was it induced in these cell lines; HO-2 on the other hand was expressed but not induced. Although they had the same ‘basal’ LIP and L-Ft levels, J16 cells contain more than 7-fold higher H-Ft levels than in HJ16 cells. It was also found that H2O2-induced labile iron is directly correlated with necrotic cell death. These results are consistent with the conclusion that both antioxidant defence mechanism and labile iron status are modulated in cells chronically exposed to H2O2. We have also shown that the ‘basal’ and ‘H2O2-induced’ NFκB activation was higher in the HJ16 cells. We have also provided a link between labile iron release, lysosomal membrane damage and the ensuing necrotic cell death following H2O2 treatment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Qenaei, Abdullah"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108070,"sim:weight":0.248073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5841426,"sim:weight":0.222654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8754,"sim:weight":0.216909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.207608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.160615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.142994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27250,"sim:weight":0.141009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study explores how and why higher education institutions in Ontario, Canada have responded to aspects of globalisation. It examines the policy context and the processes and priorities in institutional responses. First, the varying meanings and interpretations of the concept of globalisation are examined, alongside its relationship to terms such as glonacalisation, internationalisation, cross-border and borderless education. One particular element of globalisation: the recruitment of non-domestic students, is determined as the anchor point for the empirical research. Using a predominantly qualitative, mixed-methods approach, documentary research provides a foundation and framework of understanding from which detailed, empirical research is used to explore globalisation at each university studied. In the empirical study, the policy context for higher education in Ontario and Canada is first determined before aspects of each case study university are quantified. Thirdly, and most importantly, a qualitative, multiple case study approach is used to achieve a depth of understanding to establish each university’s institutional strategies and practices in response to globalisation. This allows for issues to be probed and conclusions to be drawn in a way that would not have been possible using a purely quantitative approach. Several similarities and many differences are revealed in the institutional responses that are explained in terms of policy context, institutional culture, strategic planning, institutional characteristics and settings. From these are derived some suggested adjustments to institutional strategies for each of the case study universities. More general recommendations follow, aimed at policy makers and institutional leaders, which if acted upon would improve the impact of universities’ responses to globalisation across Ontario. Suggestions for further research are given before the thesis concludes with a summary of the author’s professional and personal development during the course of the DBA.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burnett, Sally-Ann"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, little is known about the stability of the conceptualisation of QoL in the face of normative developmental processes against which to compare changes in response to non-normative events, such as chronic illness. The present study examined the stability of the QoL construct over one year in a cohort of healthy community dwelling adolescents through applying the response shift (RS) model. \r\nMethod: A cohort of 356 adolescents (M age \u003d14.05) completed the Kidscreen QoL measure on two occasions, one year apart.  Both research-design and statistical techniques were employed to assess three types of RS; recalibration, reprioritisation and reconceptualisation.  \r\nResults:  A significant recalibration of small effect size was found for three QoL domains using a then-test, which was confirmed in the domain of autonomy through statistical modelling.  No evidence was found for reprioritisation or reconceptualisation RS using either analytical approach.  \r\nConclusion: The findings support the assumption that the conceptualisation of QoL is stable during adolescence in the absence of significant health threats.  However, researchers and clinicians should be aware of potential recalibration effects of some life domains.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gillison, Fiona","Skevington, Suzanne","Standage, Martyn"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1395233,"sim:weight":0.572749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5846251,"sim:weight":0.43859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23843,"sim:weight":0.405212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.187591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.179669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.161421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

M., \u0026 Deci, E. L. (2000). Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations: classic definitions and new directions. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 25, 54–56]) in relation to sport and exercise in mid-adolescence.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nAdolescents reporting strong introjected regulation of sport and/or exercise relative to their peers were identified using quantitative questionnaires, and invited for interview. Semi-structured interviews were recorded with 10 boys and 8 girls (mean age 14 years), transcribed verbatim, and analysed using an interpretive phenomenological approach.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nIntrojected regulation accompanied high levels of self-determined motivation, and was associated with high levels of physical activity in the present sample. Two major themes emerged: (i) gender differences in the basis for introjected regulation; and (ii) differences in the reasons and goals underpinning self-determined versus introjected regulations for exercise. In boys, introjected regulation was largely related to social factors, such as avoiding social disapproval and attaining ego enhancement. Girls rarely exercised with their friends, and introjected regulation more commonly reflected the partial internalization of a health and fitness rationale. In many cases, self-determined and introjected regulations were underpinned by different goals or reasons, supporting the importance of assessing an individual\u0027s multiple motives towards activities.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nIntrojected regulation for exercise was associated with higher than expected levels of participation in sport and exercise, regardless of whether it was founded on contingent self-worth, or the partial internalization of adaptive reasons for exercise. The implications of social control on future exercise participation are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gillison, Fiona","Osborn, M","Skevington, Suzanne","Standage, Martyn"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316090,"sim:weight":0.169178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108697,"sim:weight":0.153522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108426,"sim:weight":0.141739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.136028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108547,"sim:weight":0.11864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the proposed framework, a ‘stand-off’ method is used to layer information, in the form of annotations, on top of both CAD models and lightweight representations alike. These annotations can be circulated independently of the geometry, facilitating more flexible information flow across the whole product lifecycle.

The results obtained by magneto-optical imaging demonstrate that the field at which flux quantised vortices enter the disks decays exponentially with increasing temperature and the measured data agree well with analytic models for the thermal excitation of individual pancake vortices over Bean-Livingston surface barriers. Scanning Hall probe microscopy images are used to directly map the magnetic induction profiles of individual micro-disks at different applied fields and the results can be quite successfully fitted to analytic models which assume a continuous distribution of flux in the sample. At low fields, however, the characteristic mesoscopic compression of vortex clusters in increasing magnetic fields has been observed. Even at higher fields, where single vortex resolution is lost, it is still possible to track configurational changes in the vortex patterns, since competing vortex orders impose unmistakable signatures on local magnetisation curves as a function of the applied field. These observations are in excellent agreement with molecular dynamics numerical simulations which lead to a natural definition of the lengthscale for the crossover between discrete and continuum behaviours in this system. In closely related experiments, Hall magnetometry is used to probe the out-of-plane local magnetisation of platelet BSCCO single crystals. The magnetisation is found to depend on the strength and direction of an in-plane magnetic field in the crossing vortex lattices regime. The remanent magnetisation in zero out-of-plane field is found to exhibit a pronounced anisotropy, being largest with the in-plane field parallel to the crystalline a-axis, and smallest when it is parallel to the orthogonal b-axis. This behaviour is attributed to the presence of underlying linear disorder. Finally, spectral analysis of the local magnetisation data is used to estimate a lower cutoff for the characteristic frequency of thermal fluctuations of vortex positions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Connolly, Malcolm"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2809089,"sim:weight":0.601681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28947,"sim:weight":0.358256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.313289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108049,"sim:weight":0.2377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26270,"sim:weight":0.233171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.226902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.197818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391751,"sim:weight":0.196541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85213,"sim:weight":0.170451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23890,"sim:weight":0.156897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.153787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.148379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269537,"sim:weight":0.126476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They show extraordinary diversity in their reaction chemistry and are involved in the biotransformation of a plethora of both exogenous and endogenous compounds. There has been a variety of approaches for the immobilisation of these biological redox systems and direct electrochemistry of these proteins can go towards providing biomimetic environments for fundamental studies together with a basis for designing devices without the need for electron transfer mediators. The incorporation of these proteins into mesoporous films or onto various electrode surfaces has generated interest due to the possibility of direct electron exchange between the proteins redox active sites and the host electrode. Here, two different P450 protein systems were investigated. The water soluble P450cam or Cyp101, from the soil dwelling bacteria Pseudomonas Putida and Cyp6g1, a microsomal protein form the fruit fly Drosophila Melanogaster. In this work, firstly the Cyp101 proteins were expressed and purified from a microbial culture starting material. The various steps in the purification process freed the protein from a confining matrix followed by the separation of the protein and non-protein parts of the mixture. In the latter system the enzyme is already embedded into a microsomal unit, thus more likely to mimic a biologically active environment. The utilisation of methoxy-resorufin ether (MRES) is described as an electrochemical probe for investigating the activity of the microsomal protein. This substrate also exhibits fluorescent properties which provided a dual detection system for the enzymes activity. The work then went on to investigate the absorption and reactivity of Cyp101 in porous nanoparticulateTiO2 film electrodes and on an edge plane graphite electrode.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dash, Hayley"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84807,"sim:weight":0.239596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28299,"sim:weight":0.216262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108030,"sim:weight":0.210767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.205402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1559968,"sim:weight":0.159212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is recognised that religion plays a key role in shaping moral frameworks and social identities, but little attention is paid to how this is played out in everyday life: the focus remains on ‘faith communities’ and ‘faith-based organisations’ as unified bodies. This thesis uses ethnographic methods to examine how members of two churches in rural Ghana are influenced by and engage with religion. Rather than viewing religion simply as (potentially) instrumental to development, it seeks to approach it in its own right. It challenges the rigidity of categories such as ‘physical/spiritual’ and ‘religious/non-religious’, and the notion of ‘faith communities’ as discrete, unified entities with coherent religious cosmologies. Insights from witchcraft studies and medical anthropology indicate that spiritual discourses are drawn on to negotiate hybrid and continuously changing modernities, and people tend to act pragmatically, combining and moving between discourses rather than fully espousing a particular ideology. Residents of the village studied appear to inhabit a world of different but interconnecting powers, which they are both, to some extent, subject to and able to marshal. These include God, secondary deities, juju, witchcraft, family authorities, traditional leaders, biomedicine and churches. Relationships with both spirits and humans are ambivalent and each of these powers can bring both blessings and harm. Religious experience is fluid, eclectic and pragmatic as people continually enter and exit groups and marshal different powers simultaneously to protect themselves from harm and procure blessings. Approaches by the development world seeking to engage with religion and to take seriously local people’s interests and viewpoints should thus be wary of oversimplification according to traditional Western social science categories, and be underpinned by an understanding of how religious discourses are interpreted and enacted in people’s everyday lives.","bibo:AuthorList":["Graveling, Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.237391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.235434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109125,"sim:weight":0.233189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930219,"sim:weight":0.21057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85449,"sim:weight":0.210515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734403,"sim:weight":0.19574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108938,"sim:weight":0.176354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This research brings together two distinct bodies of knowledge: social network analysis (SNA) and technology acceptance models, in order to better understand the relationship between social capital and technology acceptance. The first aspect of the research looks at social network centrality and influence measures as an alternative means to measure social influence in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The social influence construct has proven to be inconsistent in past research. An individual‟s decision to adopt a new technology is influenced by their social context or the informal social network within which they work. The social capital of others influences their attitudes and decision to adopt a new technology. Social Capital, as measured through social network analysis, could be substituted for the social influence construct of the UTAUT model. Two revised UTAUT models are developed and tested. The second aspect of this research uses social capital to inform membership of a Community of Practice (CoP) to support a Finance Management System implementation in a higher education organization. SNA can be used to gain an understanding of the social network and identify individuals with high social capital. There is growing evidence that CoP support successful organizational change initiatives but it is less clear how CoP membership might be determined. SNA provides an evidence-based approach to CoP formation. The IS implementation cases described in the paper demonstrate an innovative approach to IS implementation grounded in social capital and technology acceptance research that add to the body of knowledge in both theory and practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hamre, Lynne Janine"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

For load demands of 5-50kWe, a flexible and easily operated biomass unit would provide a viable source of energy for areas where grid connection is either expensive or prone to disconnection. This paper describes conversion and generation technology for current micro-scale biomass plant designs. Most applications handle either wet or dry biomass, but since both feedstocks are often available, this paper suggests a combination of thermochemical and supplemental biochemical conversions to create considerable amounts of fuel and hence electrical capacity. Discussing the generation part of current plants, a tendency towards using combustion-based technology has been found, while microturbines can provide usable exhaust heat streams and offer better maintenance and operation flexibility. This paper ranks power generation technologies used in current biomass plants in terms of efficiency and flexibility as well as maintenance and economic aspects. For remote locations without the opportunity of a secure grid connection, the proposed plant design demonstrates a very promising way of supplying future energy needs in terms of both electrical and thermal energy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Loeser, Mathias","Redfern, Miles"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5847768,"sim:weight":0.25973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33709,"sim:weight":0.179473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67534,"sim:weight":0.176293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.161189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The objectives of this study were to a) describe pharmacist discharge prescription transcription service (PDPTS) provided in UK hospitals prior to NMP, b) investigate the implementation of supplementary prescribing (SP) by pharmacists in England, c) explore patient opinions on development of pharmacists and nurses as independent prescribers (IP).\r\nMethods: Two postal questionnaires were undertaken, one of hospital clinical pharmacy managers (Q1) and one of PCTPs and CPs (Q2). Depth interviews with patients were also used. Ethics approval was obtained.\r\nKey Findings: For Q1 the response rate was 66% (135/206). PDPTS was offered by 49/135 (36%) of hospitals and was the most common prescribing activity undertaken. The majority of pharmacists wrote \u003c5 prescriptions per day (n\u003d25, 52%) and required counter-signature from a medical practitioner (65%, n\u003d31, 1\u003dmissing data). The response rate for Q2 was 68%. Both sectors intended to implement pharmacist SP by the end of 2005 (57%, n\u003d55 and 56%, n\u003d100 respectively). Within secondary care, the clinical areas provided were based upon established roles. Within primary care, the clinical areas were influenced by the General Medical Services (GMS) Quality and Outcomes Framework. Patient concerns included doubting ability to deal with serious conditions and diagnostic skills. Nurse prescribing was more acceptable because nurses were considered to be trustworthy. Community pharmacists were perceived as being “non-NHS” and had a negative image. Experience of pharmacist SP enforced views that pharmacists would be capable as IPs.\r\nConclusion: The majority of the PDPTS schemes were not extensive and principles of clinical governance were not met. Consensus upon authorisation requirements of PDPTS and the legal position was unclear. Regarding implementation of NMP, community pharmacists face more obstacles, such as obtaining funding for such services and public acceptance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hobson, Rachel Jane"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

I use a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to develop a dynamic, relational understanding, where social constructions are discussed and refined using cycles of loose and strict thinking, an inter-play of emotion and intellect, and a combination of intuitive and analytic reasoning. This is underpinned by an extended epistemology embracing experiential learning, documentary and textual analysis, presentational knowing, dialogue, narrative and photographic inquiry. I address the essence of inquiry with people who have difficult stories to tell and for us to comprehend: narratives which emerge from episodes of chaos and suffering, interspersed with occasional glimpses of the inter-human. Within this context I explore responsibility [response-ability] to ‘the Other’ as subject, and the ethical obligations implied in that relationship. My and others’ narratives, through space and over time, are researched using an extended epistemology and inquiry cycles across two interwoven strands. I look back over a long career and ‘epiphanous’ moments as a social worker and academic in the field of child protection and children and families work; and as the child of a war veteran, I reflect on World War II narratives of suffering, changing identity, and the inter-human. This first and second person inquiry extends outwards through cycles of dialogue with ex European prisoners of war and relation with landscape across Europe and Russia. In these reflections I clarify my meanings of chaos, suffering and responsibility [response-ability]. The learning from this extended inquiry and the contribution to knowledge are reflected on within my current practice as a participative researcher who is expressing response-ability toward the other. Finally, I consider implications for improving practice and organizational climate in children and families work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Jocelyn"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108223,"sim:weight":0.295761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.247509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.246875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86009,"sim:weight":0.22362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.189801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57364,"sim:weight":0.165159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This investigation examined the clearance phase of a model drug from the SC after a short application of an infinite dose. A saturated solution of ibuprofen in propylene glycol/water was applied to the forearm of human volunteers for 30 min. The formulation was then removed and the drug profile across the SC was assessed immediately, and over the next 4 h. The clearance phase depends only on drug diffusivity in the SC. However, the expected, progressive \"flattening\" of the concentration profiles with increasing time post-formulation removal was not observed. It was subsequently deduced, using infrared spectroscopy, that the rapid percutaneous diffusion of propylene glycol, relative to ibuprofen, resulted in the transient maintenance of a saturated drug concentration at the SC surface even after removal of the original formulation. The important role of formulation excipients in topical delivery is demonstrated, and the local disposition of cosolvents within the SC may impact significantly on drug dermatopharmacokinetics and local bioavailability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nicoli,  S.","Bunge,  A.

This thesis is aimed at the introducing experimental and theoretical analyses of a novel and revolutionary technique to dissipate unwanted energy in engineering systems. An extensive literature review on existing energy absorbers was undertaken in relevant application fields such as structural and personal protection. Hence, devices attached to buildings and designed to dissipate energy due to severe earthquakes have been discussed and compared. Types considered, in this review, are mainly based on friction, viscoelasticity and material yielding mechanisms. Furthermore, methodologies to strengthen structures against impacts such as those used in armoured walls are described, and their capabilities assessed. In addition techniques to protect the human body against dangerous loads were reviewed, and important issues for chest and head protection, leg defences in football and safety in motorcycles have been investigated. Experimental results about energy absorption in crash tests have been studied. Also, as an example the use of current technologies to dissipate energy during landing operations in aircrafts have been considered. A classified chart of energy absorption devices in different applications has been produced and referenced. In general most energy absorption devices were shown to be capable to eventually dissipate dangerous and unwanted energy, but poor reusability and predictability after impact were not part of the design process. The research base in this thesis is a novel energy dissipation technique capable of designing Universal Reusable Energy Absorption Devices (UREAD). This technique exploits the principles and working mechanisms that are used in extrusion of deformable materials through intersecting channels. Such mechanism of deformation is known in literature as Equal Channel Angular Extrusion (ECAE). ECAE is one of the severe plastic deformation processes. A theoretical analysis of internal pressure and stresses developed at the interface with the tools has been presented for channels of different geometrical parameters. In addition, energy absorption capabilities have been analysed by the Upper Bound ii method. Also, a numerical solution based on the implementation of the Finite Element Analysis, in ANSYS commercial package was obtained to show the intensity of stress distribution in the deforming material and the tools surrounding it. UREAD devices of different dimensions and geometries were designed, manufactured and tested using an experimental set up constructed for this work. Circular and square cross-sectional channels were tested using various deformable materials. Experimental results were compared with theoretical distributions, and several analogies were highlighted and discussed. Special tools were designed and manufactured to study experimentally the normal stresses at contact surfaces using the so called “Pressure Pin Technique”. Also, an experimental apparatus has been built to simulate the potential implementation of UREAD devices against the occurrence of heavy impacts and the effect of the energy absorber was experimentally measured at the instant of ground impact.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lupoi, Rocco"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24920,"sim:weight":0.226191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.220465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.220132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795333,"sim:weight":0.208551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.207044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654018,"sim:weight":0.196167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.194814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85046,"sim:weight":0.193174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.170695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26027,"sim:weight":0.143377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The objectives of my PhD were to develop new genetic markers and use these markers to address fundamental issues in evolutionary biology using shorebirds as model organisms. Shorebirds are part of the ancient avian Charadriiformes order and are characterised by extraordinary ecological and behavioural diversity. However, due to the lack of appropriate genetic markers the molecular ecology of many shorebirds has not been investigated previously. Therefore, first, I developed polymorphic microsatellite markers from genomic libraries for a behaviourally diverse shorebird, the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus (Chapter II). Second, using the genomic data-bases I expended this work to develop further markers that cannot only be used in the Kentish plover, but also a large number of other shorebird species (Chapter III). Third, I investigated population differentiation and genetic diversity of Eurasian and American Kentish plover populations using the newly developed microsatellite markers and further mitochondrial markers (Chapter IV). The genetic differences between Eurasian and American populations that are mirrored by phenotypic differences call for a reconsideration of the current taxonomic status of the species; Eurasian and American populations should be recognised as belonging to two separate species. Finally, I asked how genetic diversity influences the fitness of precocial Kentish plover young (Chapter V). I found that survival of chicks until fledging was associated with genetic diversity (measured as heterozygosity) at three of eleven marker loci.

Trade remedy measures are long standing tools of US trade policy and their use has continued to grow globally amongst member countries of the World Trade Organisation. Between 1980 and 2007 a total of 1606 of these trade remedy cases were investigated by the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission, an average of 41 antidumping and 17 countervailing duty cases a year, with a value of around US$ 63 billion or 0.3% of all US imports. Thirty-seven percent of the cases by number and 54% by value resulted in duties being imposed on the subject imports. This study uses archival material for five recent trade remedy investigations and forty-five semistructured interviews with business interests, trade attorneys and economic consultants that have experience of prosecuting these cases to understand why some firms may be more successful than others at achieving their preferred policy outcome. The imposition of duties is found to be only the simplest measure of success for US firms that file a case and does not capture the range of potential outcomes for foreign firms that face the duties. Successful prosecution of a trade case has been found to be firm specific, as the DOC determination of individual firm duty rates significantly affects what the outcome of case means for each firm in the US and foreign industries. The successful prosecution of US trade remedy cases is argued to be an informational corporate political strategy that is affected by statutory and administrative biases in the execution of the agency investigations, and creates the potential for indirect rent-seeking bias in the outcomes of cases. This informational corporate political strategy is based on three capabilities that firms need to develop, the capability to gather information, the capability to build and shape the administrative record at the agencies to reflect a firm’s policy preferences and the capability to align business practices with the US trade remedy institutions. These three capabilities are enabled by the bundling of corporate political expertise resources, organisational resources, financial resources and reputational resources. Some of these resources are internal to the firms, including staff, money and information, while other resources are external, such as the trade attorneys and economic consultants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lindeque, Johan Paul"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Chapter 1 introduces the area of rhodium-catalysed conjugate addition as a tool for asymmetric synthesis. An extensive discussion of this methodology is included and recent advances in the area will be highlighted. In addition to this some recently published alternatives to organoboranes are outlined and their use in rhodium-catalysed chemistry documented. Chapter 2 discusses the tandem process of rhodium-catalysed conjugate addition enolate protonation, a recently observed asymmetric development. By using a novel route to benzyl acrylic esters the synthesis of α,α′-dibenzyl esters is achieved in excellent yields and selectivity. This study highlights the fact that when dealing with 1,1-disubstituted activated alkenes it is more difficult to produce enantioselective results as the chirality is determined in the protonation step and not during insertion. Some insights into the mechanism are proposed based on the outcomes observed. Chapter 3 describes the total synthesis of Lyngbic Acid and related structures Hermitamides A and B. Synthesis of these natural products are achieved by synthesis of an enantiopure organoborane species and its subsequent coupling via rhodium catalysis. Some interesting insights into the addition of alkenyl organoborane species to unsubstituted 1,1-activated alkenes are detailed. Chapter 4 describes the synthesis and characterisation for the compounds discussed in the previous chapters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Penrose, Stephen David"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2803543,"sim:weight":0.293259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9972,"sim:weight":0.278068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The exclusion of Procurement from specific categories of consultancy expenditure is then viewed in the context of its aspirations to be a strategic function. The conclusion drawn is that such aspirations are flawed. Literature in the areas of services marketing, consultancy, value choice, and sourcing are examined. It is noted that the services and consultancy literature refers to the subjective approach of the individual to assess value. In addition, literature that stresses the role of individual contingency in value choices concludes that individuals will not necessarily refer to price when making such assessments. In contrast, the sourcing literature adopts objective organisational approaches to value. This dissonance is reflected in the research data which concludes that senior executives procuring strategy consultancy or ‘coaching’ services tend to use subjective value constructs to make selection decisions. This situation is problematic for procurement professionals who refer almost exclusively to objective value constructs that are specifically designed to produce benefits at an organisational level. This situation makes unlikely the full integration of procurement at a strategic level within the organisation. The choice of a subjective approach to the research using ideographic methodology produced rich and complex data. Semi-structured interviews with senior executives and an extended observation of a consultancy engagement were used. Access of this nature would normally be problematic due to the time constraints under which executives work and the sensitivity of the material. A rare opportunity, however, was presented by the status of the researcher as employee and this was exploited to gain privileged insights into executive behaviour.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tallis, Deborah"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Factor H binds to Sbi in combination with C3b or C3d, and forms tripartite Sbi: C3: Factor H complexes. Apparently, the type of C3 influences the stability of the complex; surface plasmon resonance studies revealed a higher stability of C3d complexed to Sbi, as compared to C3b or C3. As part of this tripartite complex, Factor H is functionally active and displays complement regulatory activity. Sbi, by recruiting Factor H and C3b, acts as a potent complement inhibitor, and inhibits alternative pathway-mediated lyses of rabbit erythrocytes by human serum and sera of other species. Thus, Sbi is a multifunctional bacterial protein, which binds host complement components Factor H and C3 as well as IgG and beta 2-glycoprotein I and interferes with innate immune recognition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haupt,  K.","Reuter,  M.","van den Elsen, J.M.H.","Burman, J","Halbich,  S.","Richter,  J.","Skerka,  C.","Zipfel,  P.

Recent morphological and molecular phylogenies appear highly incongruent, but this has not been assessed quantitatively. Moreover, 18S rRNA trees show striking branch length differences between species, accompanied by a conspicuous clustering of taxa with similar branch lengths. Surprisingly, previous research found no rate heterogeneity. Hitherto, no phylogenetic analysis of all major eumalacostracan taxa (orders) has either combined evidence from multiple loci, or combined molecular and morphological evidence. Results: We combined evidence from four nuclear ribosomal and mitochondrial loci (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) with a newly synthesized morphological dataset. We tested the homogeneity of data partitions, both in terms of character congruence and the topological congruence of inferred trees. We also performed Bayesian and parsimony analyses on separate and combined partitions, and tested the contribution of each partition. We tested for potential long-branch attraction (LBA) using taxon deletion experiments, and with relative rate tests. Additionally we searched for molecular polytomies (spurious clades). Lastly, we investigated the phylogenetic stability of taxa, and assessed their impact on inferred relationships over the whole tree. We detected significant conflict between data partitions, especially between morphology and molecules. We found significant rate heterogeneity between species for both the 18S rRNA and combined datasets, introducing the possibility of LBA. As a test case, we showed that LBA probably affected the position of Spelaeogriphacea in the combined molecular evidence analysis. We also demonstrated that several clades, including the previously reported and surprising clade of Amphipoda plus Spelaeogriphacea, are \u0027supported\u0027 by zero length branches. Furthermore we showed that different sets of taxa have the greatest impact upon the relationships within molecular versus morphological trees. Conclusion: Rate heterogeneity and conflict between data partitions mean that existing molecular and morphological evidence is unable to resolve a well-supported eumalacostracan phylogeny. We believe that it will be necessary to look beyond the most commonly utilized sources of data (nuclear ribosomal and mitochondrial sequences) to obtain a robust tree in the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jenner, Ronald A","Dhubhghaill,  C.

The method requires no a priori assumptions about the source other than that its strength at the frequency of interest varies sinusoidally in azimuth on the source disk so that the radiated acoustic field is composed of a single circumferential mode. When multiple azimuthal modes are present, the acoustic field can be decomposed into azimuthal modes and the method applied to each mode in sequence. The method proceeds in two stages, first finding an intermediate line source derived from the source distribution and then inverting this line source to find the radial variation in source strength. A far-field form of the radiation integrals is derived, showing that the far-field pressure is a band-limited Fourier transform of the line source, establishing a limit on the quality of source reconstruction, which can be achieved using far-field measurements.

Typically eukaryotic protein production experiments have relied on varying expression construct cassettes such as promoters and tags, or culture process parameters such as pH, temperature and aeration to enhance yields. These approaches require repeated rounds of trial-and-error optimization and cannot provide a mechanistic insight into the biology of recombinant protein production. We published an early transcriptome analysis that identified genes implicated in successful membrane protein production experiments in yeast. While there has been a subsequent explosion in such analyses in a range of production organisms, no one has yet exploited the genes identified. The aim of this study was to use the results of our previous comparative transcriptome analysis to engineer improved yeast strains and thereby gain an understanding of the mechanisms involved in high-yielding protein production hosts. Results: We show that tuning BMSI transcript levels in a doxycycline-dependent manner resulted in optimized yields of functional membrane and soluble protein targets. Online flow microcalorimetry demonstrated that there had been a substantial metabolic change to cells cultured under high-yielding conditions, and in particular that high yielding cells were more metabolically efficient. Polysome profiling showed that the key molecular event contributing to this metabolically efficient, high-yielding phenotype is a perturbation of the ratio of 60S to 40S ribosomal subunits from approximately 1: 1 to 2: 1, and correspondingly of 25S:18S ratios from 2: 1 to 3:1. This result is consistent with the role of the gene product of BMSI in ribosome biogenesis. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the power of a rational approach to recombinant protein production by using the results of transcriptome analysis to engineer improved strains, thereby revealing the underlying biological events involved.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bonander,  N.","Darby,  R.

These novel electric field measurements in space enable the determination of the nocturnal transionospheric attenuation by comparison with ground based electric field measurements. The electric field measurements on the satellite indicate that the nocturnal transionospheric attenuation of 100 kHz radio waves from LORAN transmissions is equivalent to a nocturnal subionospheric attenuation of the 100 kHz radio waves at a distance of similar to 7-9 Mm. The radio waves exhibit an average subionospheric attenuation of similar to 5 dB/Mm and it is concluded that the nocturnal transionospheric attenuation of 100 kHz radio waves is similar to 35-45 dB.

Because both parents benefit from care via the offspring, whereas they pay the costs individually, a conflict is expected about how much care each parent should provide. How do parents settle this conflict? We addressed this question by reducing nest temperatures during incubation in the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus, a small ground-nesting shorebird in which the parents share incubation. By cooling the clutch using a remote-controlled device built under the nest, we experimentally increased the workload of either the male or the female in random order and recorded the behavioral responses of the targeted parent and its mate. Unlike most previous manipulations of parental effort, our manipulation sought to measure a parent\u0027s response to an increase, not a shortfall, in the partner\u0027s contribution. The manipulation was also short term and reversed between the members of a given pair. We found that there is a trade-off between the efforts of parents because increased (or reduced) effort by the targeted parent was associated with decreased (or increased) effort by its mate, respectively. This result is consistent with theoretical models that predict compensation as a response to changed parental effort of the mate. We also found that compensation was consistent between treatments when the male or the female of a given pair was targeted. Furthermore, our results support the notion that parents adjust their effort in response to their mate\u0027s behavior in real time, that is, they negotiate parental roles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kosztolanyi, A","Cuthill,  I.

If data are analysed group sequentially, there will be subjects in the pipeline at each interim analysis who have started treatment but have yet to respond. If the stopping rule is satisfied, data will continue to accrue as these pipeline subjects respond. Standard designs stipulate that the overrun data be excluded from any analysis. However, their inclusion may be mandatory if trial results are to be included in a filing for regulatory approval. Methods have been proposed to provide a more complete treatment of the pipeline data, for example Whitehead (1992) and Faldum \u0026 Hommel(2007), although several issues remain unresolved. The work presented in this thesis provides a complete framework for dealing systematically with delayed responses in a group sequential setting. We formulate designs providing a proper treatment of the pipeline data which can be planned ahead of time. Optimal versions are used to assess the benefits for early stopping of group sequential analysis when there is a delay in response. Our new tests still deliver substantial benefits when the delay in response is small. While these fall as the delay increases, incorporating data on a highly correlated short-term endpoint is found to be effective at recouping many of these losses. P-values and confidence intervals for on termination of our delayed response tests are derived. We also extend our methodology to formulate user-friendly error spending tests for delayed responses which can deal with unpredictable sequences of information. Survival data are a special type of delayed response, where the length of delay is random and of primary interest. Deriving optimal survival tests, we conclude that tests minimising expected sample size for “standard” data are also highly efficient survival trials, achieving a rapid expected time to a conclusion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hampson, Lisa"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.201932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.161692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84947,"sim:weight":0.109818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These disputes are not in themselves harmful to children. Rather, it is the strategies used to resolve conflict that have a bearing on children’s health and development, notably whether family members employ aggressive or violent tactics. The study examines evidence from a sample of 161 children, selected to be representative of children living in Dublin, Ireland. It explores children’s responses to different methods of conflict resolution in two family relationships and seeks to expand the understanding of how social problems, such as child maltreatment and domestic violence, occur within normative family processes.\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe study shows that the use of psychological and minor physical aggression to resolve conflict in the parental relationship and the parent-child relationship is typical. It occurs in 90 per cent of families over a twelve-month period. Severe physical force or violence between family members is less common. The study finds that while there is considerable variation in children’s responses to conflict resolution strategies, children who experience aggression in both the inter-parental and parent-child relationship are at elevated risk for behavioural and emotional problems. The frequency and severity of the aggression explains some of the variance in child well-being but not all. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n \r\n\u003cp\u003eThe study lends support to Bronfrenbrenner’s (1979) ecological theory by demonstrating empirically how the individual, family, neighbourhood, and potentially societal, contexts moderate the transmission of poor conflict resolution strategies to children\u0027s health and development. The findings suggest that while the child\u0027s age and gender play a small role, family and neighbourhood contexts are strongly implicated in outcomes for children exposed to risky conflict resolution tactics in the home. In particular, parental mental health problems, low socio-economic status and poor peer relationships increase children’s vulnerability to the effects of aggressive conflict tactics.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n \r\n\u003cp\u003eThe relevance of the evidence for policy and practice are drawn out. A distinction can be drawn between responses to pathological behaviour by parents and normative, yet harmful, conflict resolution strategies. Public health approaches to promote reasoning within families as well as prevention and early intervention strategies that support all families, not just economically disadvantaged parents known to child protection and domestic violence agencies, are required.

Methods: A review of studies on the impact of interventions on young people under the age of 18 was conducted. It included interventions that were designed to prevent the illegal sale of tobacco to children and young people. The review was conducted in July 2007, and included 20 papers on access restriction studies. The quality of the papers was assessed and the relevant data was extracted. Results: The evidence obtained from the review indicates that access restriction interventions may produce significant reductions in the rate of illegal tobacco sales to youth. However, lack of enforcement and the ability of youth to acquire cigarettes from social sources may undermine the effectiveness of these interventions. Conclusions: When access interventions are applied in a comprehensive manner, they can affect young people’s access to tobacco.

Whether these systems are slant-path links, terrestrial fixed links, or deep-space links, the high bandwidths available and the relatively low spectral congestion are very attractive. One of the main disadvantages of these frequency bands is that the attenuation caused by meteorological effects can become significant, and the attenuation caused by clouds, rain, and atmospheric gases becomes very large. The largest attenuation events are caused by rain and clouds with a high liquid water content. In order to provide high-availability links, it is possible to use site diversity, by providing two spatially independent terminals. The spatial separation of the terminals reduces the probability of both terminals being faded. In this paper, we present an analysis of two spatially unique measurements of a satellite-based 20.7-GHz beacon. The results show that even at modest separations there is still the opportunity for significant availability improvements using site diversity. The probability density functions (pdfs) conditioned on the single-site attenuation level are presented.

Among the renewable DGs, wind energy is emerging as the popular choice due to its mature technology and low operation and maintenance costs. This paper utilizes the reliability aspects of electrical power systems to provide a probabilistic approach to determine the capacity credit (CC) of distributed generators. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to cater for the stochastic nature of the simulations and each trial is validated using the Newton-Raphson optimal load flow solution. Bernoulli trials are used to simulate the availability of network components. An algorithm to evaluate the capacity credit due to distributed generation (DG) connected in the network is shown. Hence, the amount of conventional generation which can be backed off from the bulk supply point (BSP) of the distribution network can be quantified. Wind energy production is known to depend on the wind regime experienced by the wind turbines, as well as the geographical landscape and the presence of wind obstacles, which in turn determines capacity credit. Having verified that adding a specific DG at each node does not violate any operating constraints, it was assumed that thermal constraints would not affect CC in this particular system. In a more in-depth study, it is shown in this paper that capacity credit also varies with the different voltage levels at which the wind turbine generators Are connected and the loading level of the distribution network. Moreover, it is shown that CC does not vary with the base case reliability, but rather with wind penetration levels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pudaruth, Girish R","Li, Furong R"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24358,"sim:weight":0.388153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26424,"sim:weight":0.372699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176817,"sim:weight":0.370466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109094,"sim:weight":0.364253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108820,"sim:weight":0.354129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85296,"sim:weight":0.337531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23714,"sim:weight":0.312393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734349,"sim:weight":0.308234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84850,"sim:weight":0.306296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108846,"sim:weight":0.296825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386659,"sim:weight":0.277656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108345,"sim:weight":0.269476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.25603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931857,"sim:weight":0.24955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108372,"sim:weight":0.241223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931258,"sim:weight":0.240645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1511648,"sim:weight":0.232851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108810,"sim:weight":0.207237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Sensor nodes need to operate with very low-power consumption and under the constraint of limited memory capacity. Therefore, it is wasteful to digitize the sensor signal at a constant sample rate, given that the frequency contents of the signals vary with time. Adaptive sampling is established as a practical method to reduce the sample data volume. In this paper a low-power analog system is proposed, which adjusts the converter clock rate to perform a peak-picking algorithm on the second derivative of the input signal.

Therefore, a quantitative indication of the quality of a measurement result needs to be given to enable its reliable use. Uncertainty is one such indication. Provision of incorrect uncertainty statements for measurements performed by a co-ordinate measuring machine (CMM) may lead to very serious economic implications. In this study, the uncertainty of CMM measurements is estimated by a single parameter accounting for both systematic and random errors. The effects that environmental conditions (temperature), discretionary set-up parameters (probe extension, stylus length), and measuring plan decisions (number of points) have on uncertainty of measurements are then investigated.

This is especially true in those cases where a large number of difficult-to-identify and difficult-to-control factors hinder the experimenters in their efforts to obtain reliable measurement results. Dimensional measurements of features on the micro- and nano-scales is one such case. A white-light interferometer (WLI) microscope can perform measurements of a variety of measurands over a broad dimensional range: from surface texture characterisations on the nano-scale to measurements of step heights of several millimetres. Calibration methods based on the hypothesis of a linear calibration curve can be inadequate to express the relationship between measurement results and traceable reference materials (RMs). A calibration procedure built into a commercially available WLI microscope is critically compared with methods presented in an international standard. This comparison is enabled by a cost-effective procedure for establishing traceable RMs in the micro-range. Advantages of calibration procedures based on more than one RM are then demonstrated within the ranges from 180.5 to 219.5 μm and from 1.5 to 501.5 μm. Calibration methods involving regression modelling of transformed measurement results are considered for these two intervals to overcome the highlighted weaknesses of the calibration procedure built in the examined WLI.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ferri, Carlo","Faraway, Julian","Brousseau, Emmanuel"],"dc:date":"2010-03-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1653331,"sim:weight":0.261083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54114,"sim:weight":0.236153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57340,"sim:weight":0.235277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60984,"sim:weight":0.182433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56595,"sim:weight":0.166839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.147366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57140,"sim:weight":0.13261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.127574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176877,"sim:weight":0.10374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821123,"sim:weight":0.0957681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176820,"sim:weight":0.0946235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The synthesis of nanotubular titania by anodisation, a relatively simple and low cost technique, represents a motivation for scientists, considering the impact that such a material could have on a variety of applications, including gas-sensing, biomedical, photocatalysis, and photovoltaics. This research project has focused on the optimisation of the growth process of anodic titania nanotubes, both in an aqueous (NaF/Na2SO4) and an organic (Glycerol/NaF) electrolyte containing fluorine ions. Reproducibility and the ability to generate anodic films having a thickness of several micrometers are fundamental steps to be achieved before investigating any possible application of the nanotubes. To characterise the anodic specimens and build upon the general lack of information on the growth mechanism, a comprehensive study of the different stages of the process has been performed, using Scanning and Transmission Electronic Microscopy (SEM and TEM). Among the questions to be addressed in this thesis, is to establish whether the anodic film undergoes a transition from pores to tubes or develops a tubular morphology from the beginning of its growth. Additional characterisation of the anodisation process includes the study of current-time curves, and chemical composition analysis of the anodic layers using X-ray Photo-Electron Spectroscopy (XPS). The thermal stability of the nanotubes and structural/morphological changes as a result of heat treatment at different temperatures were also studied, again using SEM, TEM, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The final part of the thesis is dedicated to preliminary work on the use of anodised TiO2 nanotubes in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs), along with suggestions for future works and general conclusions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Regonini, Domenico"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1562015,"sim:weight":0.442813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567220,"sim:weight":0.288083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.257924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567217,"sim:weight":0.221294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.179772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.165709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27178,"sim:weight":0.158719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567104,"sim:weight":0.152618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12226,"sim:weight":0.151297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930233,"sim:weight":0.148425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1594217,"sim:weight":0.14769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85224,"sim:weight":0.134001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11534,"sim:weight":0.129001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.127171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While normal PrP has four PHGGGWGQ octapeptide segments in its flexible N-terminal domain, expanded forms may have up to nine additional octapeptide inserts. The type of prion disease segregates with the degree of expansion. With up to four extra octarepeats, the average onset age is above 60 years, whereas five to nine extra octarepeats results in an average onset age between 30 and 40 years, a difference of almost three decades. In wild-type PrP, the octarepeat domain takes up copper (Cu2+) and is considered essential for in vivo function. Work from our lab demonstrates that the copper coordination mode depends on the precise ratio of Cu2+ to protein. At low Cu2+ levels, coordination involves histidine side chains from adjacent octarepeats, whereas at high levels each repeat takes up a single copper ion through interactions with the histidine side chain and neighboring backbone amides. Here we use both octarepeat constructs and recombinant PrP to examine how copper coordination modes are influenced by octarepeat expansion. We find that there is little change in affinity or coordination mode populations for octarepeat domains with up to seven segments (three inserts). However, domains with eight or nine total repeats (four or five inserts) become energetically arrested in the multi-histidine coordination mode, as dictated by higher copper uptake capacity and also by increased binding affinity. We next pooled all published cases of human prion disease resulting from octarepeat expansion and find remarkable agreement between the sudden length-dependent change in copper coordination and onset age. Together, these findings suggest that either loss of PrP copper-dependent function or loss of copper-mediated protection against PrP polymerization makes a significant contribution to early onset prion disease.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stevens,  D.

By considering the interaction between self and other to be the source of knowledge, these interview conversations provided a vehicle through which the human encounter with death and loss not only found expression but came into being.\r\n\r\nBereavement is approached as a ‘cultural object’, so as to capture prevailing ideas, norms and beliefs about how this should be handled and provide further insight into the place of death in contemporary British Society. Such ‘norms’ are taken to be co-constructed through discursive practice, and continually evolving through negotiation between the individual and social processes. Attention is therefore drawn to the way people use available cultural forms to construct and express meanings that are particular and personal to them. \r\n\r\nThis study demonstrates the value of an interactive approach for gaining a fuller understanding of the complexity of social life, thereby contributing to methodological and ethical debates on the implications of using qualitative, interactive methods, particularly with sensitive topics. It highlights the co-constructed nature of the data and the crucial role of self-reflexivity in managing the emotional impact of the research on the researcher as well as the participants. \r\n\r\nAn analysis of interview narratives has revealed how deceased loved ones retained a significant social presence in the life of survivors regardless of other social factors.

By incorporating both structural and environmental optimization algorithms into the framework, a “concurrent engineering” approach is adopted, whereby information on the consequences of different design decisions is provided up-front. This results in a tool through which practicing engineers and architects can explore concepts in an informed manner, helping to steer their creativity towards designs with efficiency built-in. The paper introduces the basic software platform and goes on to describe the implementation of subdivision surface modeling, formfinding and optimization techniques. The benefits of combining these capabilities in a single tool are then demonstrated through a case-study, and the future direction of the research is discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shepherd, Paul","Richens, Paul"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2802672,"sim:weight":0.223421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As manganese has previously been suggested to be involved in prion disease we have investigated manganese binding to PrP and its role in the toxicity of the protein. We have shown that manganese bound PrP (MnPrP) has several of the characteristics of the disease form of PrP, including protease resistance and toxicity that is dependent on cellular PrP expression. Further investigation into the mechanism of toxicity revealed that MnPrP is significantly more toxic to neuronal cells than nonmanganese bound PrP and that toxicity requires the presence of known metal binding residues within the protein. We have demonstrated that treatment of neuronal cells with MnPrP causes caspase 3 activation and apoptosis, as demonstrated by DNA laddering, and we hypothesise that caspase 3 is activated by a p38 pathway. Treatment of neurones with MnPrP also caused a significant increase in cellular ROS production, although this did not appear to be a major cause of cell death as antioxidants were unable to save cells from cell death. We also investigated mechanisms by which cells can survive scrapie infection and MnPrP toxicity. We have shown that cells infected with scrapie have increased ERK activation which was important for their survival. Cells that survived MnPrP treatment were also found to have increased ERK activation. This suggests that ERK may have a protective role in prion diseases and may be a potential therapeutic target.","bibo:AuthorList":["Uppington, Kay Marie"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26717,"sim:weight":0.401896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23935,"sim:weight":0.250321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24787,"sim:weight":0.1927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.174408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108070,"sim:weight":0.168345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5841426,"sim:weight":0.153101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.140027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.137721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.135412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It probes the individuals’ participation in ‘the Training Programme for Talents in Shortage’ (STTP), their perceptions of the value of lifelong learning and their experience in competing for employment. It takes the position that rather than focusing only on policy-makers’ views, an understanding of people’s perceptions and participation in this programme can provide a proper basis for the formulation and the evaluation of the policy on a learning society (Gerard and Rees, 2002). STTP is a localized education and training programme in the post-compulsory sector, providing qualifications with largely local value. It has been developed and implemented by the Shanghai Municipal Government since 1993 as a means to enhance the city’s stock of human capital and to promote the development of a ‘learning society’. On the one hand, STTP is inspired and designed by straightforward human capital development concerns and has been implemented through a decentralized, semimarketised approach, to maintain the momentum of the city’s development by targeting key skills shortages. On the other hand, significant socio-economic changes, such as the emergence of a labour market, lead individuals to take on full personal responsibility for their own social position and to compete against each other. People seek to obtain all sorts of advantages to manage and construct their employability; this study investigates the role of STTP and its qualifications in building individuals’ portfolio of skills, qualifications and other aspects of their individual human capital. The thesis draws on two sets of literature: that on lifelong learning and employability, and that on sociological theories of engagement with and participation in lifelong learning, notably rational choice theory and theories of positional competition. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of data gathering and analysis were applied. A questionnaire was administrated to 279 course participants; and interviews were conducted with 11 course participants, 4 non-participants and 4 course deliverers and policy-makers. Both instruments explored perceptions and experiences of the labour market, reasons for participating (or not) in STTP, their views on lifelong learning and the relationship between STTP, lifelong learning and the labour market. The finding suggests that a full understanding of individuals’ work and learning involves an analysis of a complex of relational interdependence between socially and culturally derived factors and personally subjective views of whom they are. In addition, the finding suggests that certain aspects of STTP, coupled with existing perceptions of formal education in Shanghai on the one hand and various interpretations of the needs of the labour market on the other, may be acting to challenge the original intentions of the programme, especially in terms of building a learning society.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Qi"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52031,"sim:weight":0.420464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316083,"sim:weight":0.384968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.340787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.329641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51515,"sim:weight":0.287546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316484,"sim:weight":0.239009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.215426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is well known as a hypothalamic factor which controls the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis during basal activity and stress. CRF also serves a neurotransmitter function in the brain, where it is implicated in a range of stress-related behaviours. The measurement of local cerebral glucose utilisation (LCGU) using radiolabelled 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) provides an estimate of cellular activity in the brain. 2DG competes with glucose in its metabolic pathway, but is not fully metabolised, instead accumulating within astrocytes where it can be quantified. After consideration of available modifications to the LCGU technique, the effect of manipulating the CRF system on LCGU was studied, in order to test the hypothesis that CRF and other endogenously expressed CRF-related peptides would induce different patterns of LCGU, and to examine the involvement of CRF receptors in any response. The CRF1 receptor has been implicated in the mediation of stress- and anxiety-related behaviour, while recent evidence has suggested a role for CRF2 in mediating the delayed effects of stress, although it has previously been postulated that CRF2 may be involved in the attenuation of stress-related behaviour. CRF and the endogenous CRF-related peptide Urocortin 1 both induced increases in LCGU in a number of brain regions associated with the CRF system, with concomitant activation of the HPA axis. CRF induced increases in LCGU in the dissected hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum and hippocampus, while Urocortin 1 induced a significant increase in LCGU in a dissected hindbrain region, with trend-like effects in frontal cortex and hippocampus. These regions contain components of the CRF system, or receive projections from regions involved in the CRF system, and have been implicated in stress-related function. The effects of CRF on LCGU appear to be mediated by the CRF2 receptor, as they were abolished by the selective CRF2 antagonist antisauvagine-30, but persisted in mice lacking CRF1 and were unaffected by a selective CRF1 antagonist. However, neither of the endogenous CRF-related peptides selective for CRF2, Urocortin 2 and Stresscopin, affected LCGU, which may indicate ligand-specific effects within the CRF system. In contrast to the effects of CRF, restraint stress reduced LCGU, while activating the HPA axis, and this response was unaffected by a selective CRF1 antagonist. This data suggests that the role of CRF receptors in restraint-induced LCGU changes may be overshadowed by effects on other neurotransmitter systems. These studies support the hypothesis that CRF and other endogenously expressed CRF-related peptides would induce different patterns of LCGU, and highlight the involvement of particular brain regions in the response to CRF receptor stimulation. Furthermore, these studies provide evidence suggesting ligand-specific effects within the CRF system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Warnock, Geoffrey Iain"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.130394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.12609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268784,"sim:weight":0.11387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.103497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.101973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The General Task Learning Framework (GTLF) is built upon many of the principles learned through the development of COIL, and can additionally facilitate multi-modal, lifelong learning of complex skills and skill hierarchies. Both systems are validated through experiments conducted in the virtual reality-style game domain of Unreal Tournament (Digital Extremes, 1999).

The linear properties of PCF include endlessly single-mode transmission, highly controllable dispersion and birefringence. These unique properties have made PCFs the best media to demonstrate all kinds of nonlinear effects such as self-phase modulation (SPM), cross-phase modulation (XPM), Raman effects, four-wave mixing and modulation instability (FWM and MI), and soliton effects. The combination of these nonlinear effects has led to impressive spectral broadening known as SC generation in PCFs. The intrinsic correlation of signal and idler photons from FWM has brought PCF to the application of single-photon\r\ngeneration. Four projects about SC generation were demonstrated. The first was visible continuum generation in a monolithic PCF device, which gave a compact, bright\r\n(-20 dBm/nm), flat and single-mode visible continuum source extending to short wavelength at 400 nm. The second was polarised SC generation in a highly bire-fringent PCF. A well linearly polarised continuum source spanning 450-1750 nm was achieved with \u003e99% power kept in a single linear polarisation. This polarised continuum source was then applied to tuneable visible/UV generation in a BIBO crystal. The third was residual pump peak removal for SC generation in PCFs. The fourth was to design an all-fibre dual-wavelength pumping for spectrally localised continuum generation. Two projects about photon pair generation using FWM were then demonstrated. One was an all-fibre photon pair source designed in the telecom band for quantum communication. This source achieved \u003e50% heralding efficiency which is the highest in fibre photon pair sources reported so far. Another one was to design birefringent PCFs for naturally narrow band photon pair generation in the Si SPAD high detection efficiency range. 0.122 nm bandwidth signal photons at 596.8 nm were generated through cross polarisation phase matched FWM in a weakly birefringent PCF pumped by a picosecond Ti:Sapphire laser at 705 nm in the normal dispersion regime.","bibo:AuthorList":["Xiong, Chunle"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2813804,"sim:weight":0.401091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584826,"sim:weight":0.363751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513563,"sim:weight":0.348945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109196,"sim:weight":0.263959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932142,"sim:weight":0.227302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.139281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thus machine tool representation is a vital part of modelling any manufacturing system. With the rapid advances in computerized numerically controlled (CNC) machines, machine tool representation has become a more challenging task than ever before. Today\u0027s CNC machine tools are more than just automated manufacturing machines, as they can be considered multi-purpose, multi-tasking, and hybrid machining centres. This paper presents a versatile methodology for representing such state-of-the-art CNC machining system resources. A machine tool model is a conceptual representation of the real machine tool and provides a logical framework for representing its functionality in the manufacturing system. There are several commercial modelling tools available in the market for modelling machine tools. However, there is no common methodology among them to represent the wide diversity of machine tool configurations. These modelling tools are either machine vendor specific or limited in their scope to represent machine tool capability. In addition, the current information models of STEP-NC, namely ISO 14649, can only describe machining operations, technologies, cutting tools, and product geometries. However, they do not support the representation of machine tools. The proposed unified manufacturing resource model (UMRM) has a data model which can fill this gap by providing machine specific data in the form of an EXPRESS schema and act as a complementary part to the STEP-NC standard to represent various machine tools in a standardized form. UMRM is flexible enough to represent any type of CNC machining centre. This machine tool representation can be utilized to represent machine tool functionality and consequential process capabilities for allocating resources for process planning and machining.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vichare, Parag","Nassehi, Aydin","Newman, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Being enterprise-wide systems, they are used within an organization in order to standardise its data and streamline its business processes. However, the envisaged benefits of installing an ERP system, such as better control over the company’s operations and seamless integration and data exchange, often fail to materialize. Although the literature has looked into the factors affecting a successful ERP implementation and adoption, it has largely overlooked the actual use of the system. However, as ERP systems have become widespread in many organizations, it is important to examine the use of such systems and their organizational consequences in-situ. This research is particularly concerned with the impact of the use of ERP systems on organizational control and drift. The main argument is that there are contextual factors, in the form of existing organizational control and drift, which influence the use of the ERP system by its users. The actual use of the ERP system can then also lead to organizational control or drift itself. This depends on the way the system is used by its users, as well as the affordances of the system. The former is characterized as human agency in this thesis, while the latter is characterized as machine agency. An interpretive case study approach is adopted to examine those issues. A main case study is examined in depth, aided by four auxiliary case studies. The main contribution of this research is the provision of rich insights regarding the use of ERP systems and their organizational consequences.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ignatiadis, Ioannis"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The aim of the current research was to characterise the electrical properties of hydroxyapatite-barium titanate (HABT) composites and to assess in vitro biological responses to the composites in order to investigate their potential use as bone graft substitutes. A range of HABT ceramics of different compositions was manufactured and their electrical properties were measured. The microstructure and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics were both dependent on the proportion of barium titanate (BT) present. Composites containing more than 70% BT displayed piezoelectric charge coefficients (d33) of up to 86.3±7.9pCN-1 (95% BT). The ferroelectric nature of the 90 and 95% BT materials was confirmed by assessment of their ferroelectric hysteresis loops. The highest piezoelectric voltage coefficient (g33) recorded was 14x10-3Vm-1Pa-1 (90% BT). Following the assessment of the electrical properties, the HABT ceramic containing 90% BT was selected for the assessment of biological responses to the composites. The proliferation, viability, activity and morphology of human osteoblast-like cells cultured on HABT were comparable to those cultured on hydroxyapatite (HA) up to 7 days after seeding. The remnant polarisation of poled HABT induced an increase in cell attachment. This influence was independent of the nature (positive or negative) of the polarisation. Poling was not found to influence cell morphology, activity or differentiation in the first 7 days of incubation. At 14 days after seeding, results were inconsistent, indicating some variations in cell population and differentiation depending on the composition and poling of the ceramics respectively. This study has substantially defined the electrical properties of a range of HABT ceramics. It indicates their in vitro biocompatibility and thus their potential for use as bone graft substitutes.

In complex situations, for example with concentrated soil reinforcement, strong or weak layers, or concentrated applied loading, the assumptions made to allow ‘rigorous’ analysis are likely to be simplistic. The results of individual analyses could be in error, and the location of the critical slip surface is thus likely to be wrong. The factor of safety could be overestimated because of the impossibility of full shear strength being mobilised all along a shear surface at once, or underestimated because the need to distort the sliding mass of soil as movement takes place is not properly accounted for. In such cases, an engineering judgment has been necessary to identify the potential problem (if it has been recognised at all), and hence an automated optimisation routine cannot work. The multiple wedge method as used here avoids these problems, and so can be used successfully with SGA to identify the critical surface. This is demonstrated here.","bibo:AuthorList":["McCombie, Paul"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25850,"sim:weight":0.281913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25770,"sim:weight":0.261838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108243,"sim:weight":0.250801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109166,"sim:weight":0.226488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.199998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27638,"sim:weight":0.191754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26022,"sim:weight":0.184681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26277,"sim:weight":0.179374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85881,"sim:weight":0.177699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108986,"sim:weight":0.172438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931886,"sim:weight":0.167435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25819,"sim:weight":0.121346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Smoking cessation counselling provided via telephone can either be reactive (i.e. primarily involving the provision of evidence-based information), or proactive (i.e. primarily involving repeated, sequenced calls from and interaction with trained cessation counsellors). Some studies have found proactive telephone counselling more effective and this trial will investigate whether or not proactive telephone support for smoking cessation, delivered through the National Health Service (NHS) Smoking Helpline is more effective or cost-effective than reactive support. It will also investigate whether or not providing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), in addition to telephone counselling, has an adjunctive impact on smoking cessation rates and whether or not this is cost effective. Methods: This will be a parallel group, factorial design RCT, conducted through the English national NHS Smoking Helpline which is run from headquarters in Glasgow. Participants will be smokers who call the helpline from any location in England and who wish to stop smoking. If 644 participants are recruited to four equally-sized trial groups (total sample size \u003d 2576), the trial will have 90% power for detecting a treatment effect (Odds Ratio) of 1.5 for each of the two interventions: i) proactive versus reactive support and ii) the offer of NRT versus no offer. The primary outcome measure for the study is self-reported, prolonged abstinence from smoking for at least six months following an agreed quit date. A concurrent health economic evaluation will investigate the cost effectiveness of the two interventions when delivered via a telephone helpline. Discussion: The PORTSSS trial will provide high quality evidence to determine the most appropriate kind of counselling which should be provided via the NHS Smoking Helpline and also whether or not an additional offer of cost-free NRT is effective and cost effective for smoking cessation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coleman,  T.","McEwen,  A.","Bauld, Linda","Ferguson, Janet","Lorgelly,  P.","Lewis,  S."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53238,"sim:weight":0.317069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26676,"sim:weight":0.254351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.237759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.165599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.0969757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, we provide results about the probability of interchanges\r\nin the ordering of the eigenvalues and changes in the eigenvectors of symmetric matrices subject to stochastic perturbations. In this analysis we use a novel combination of traditional Numerical Linear Algebra, Perturbation Theory and Probability Theory. The motivation for this study arises from reliability of spectral clustering of networks, when network data is subject to noise. As far as we are aware, there is nothing comparable in the literature.\r\nFurther, we make conjectures from which we derive an asymptotic relation between the distributions of the largest eigenvalue and the 2-norm of random symmetric ma-\r\ntrices, whose entries above the main diagonal are independent, identically distributed random variables with probability density functions being symmetric with respect to zero, including matrices from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). As far as we know, some of these conjectures are not new (possibly only as conjectures) but we are not aware of any proofs.\r\nAlso, we consider networks of coupled oscillators. In their analysis we use both, knowledge of dynamical systems and spectral properties of non-negative matrices. As a result, we present an algorithm, which uncovers the \\master-slave\" structure of the network. With its help, the analysis of the dynamics and the entrainment of the entire network can be reduced to considering only few of the oscillators, those whose dynamics determine the behaviour of the rest. This can be helpful in large networks exhibiting the \\master-slave\" structure.\r\nFinally, we consider similarities of spectral clustering with respect to di®erent matrices which can be associated with a given network. In particular, we compare clustering\r\nof products of Path graphs with respect to two di®erent matrices: the Laplacian and the Normalised Laplacian matrices of the graph. We make the comparison by constructing a Homotopy between two eigenvalue problems and, using some Linear Algebra techniques, we show that the two matrices give similar spectral clusterings when applied\r\nto products of Path graphs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stoyanov, Zhivko"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1147607,"sim:weight":0.329311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":238096,"sim:weight":0.328419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20350,"sim:weight":0.266285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26929,"sim:weight":0.256521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19444,"sim:weight":0.25339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.243897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.239161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27367,"sim:weight":0.237661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.237477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85525,"sim:weight":0.237175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.208577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

With the nation state appearing as a key problem in a\r\nglobally comparative account of social policy, the roles of other actors above and\r\nbelow the nation state are thus significant in any analysis of power relations, social\r\nreproduction and policy outcomes. It is clear that in many poorer countries, the\r\nproblem for state actors is that power, authority and, more problematically, legitimacy\r\nlies significantly elsewhere. This is demonstrated by analytical reference to the\r\ninstitutional responsibility matrix (IRM), with global and national level dimensions\r\nacross the domains of state, market, community and household. A review of this\r\nmatrix indicates other loci of power, together with a contaminating permeability\r\nbetween these 4 domains of power. This negative permeability arises from a\r\ndeployment of personalised social and cultural resources rather than accessible social\r\ncapital (i.e. transparent and accountable), and functions to reduce the capacity of state\r\nactors to act in open democratic ways. Importantly, aspects of globalisation can\r\ninteract directly with sub-national entities thus by-passing and undermining the state.\r\nMNCs deal with ethnic power structures and local warlords to access oil, minerals,\r\nprecious metals and diamonds, sometimes via interlinked money laundering and arms\r\nagreements--thus promoting regional bases of power at the expense of central\r\nauthority. International donors (including charities) sometimes leapfrog the state to\r\nimplement projects via regional governments and NGOs. Remittances avoid the\r\ntaxing capacity of the state. Wider faith movements operate directly with their\r\ncongregations. Cross border ethnic solidarities represent secessionary challenges to\r\ntheir respective, weakly embedded \u0027nation\u0027 states. Large ethnic concentrations\r\nsubstitute themselves for the national identity as the price for remaining part of a\r\nlarger whole. Economic and political transactions are conducted through the\r\npersonalised networks of kin, clan, ethnic, race, caste and other such identities,\r\nentailing exclusion and preferentialism. And there are civil society and philanthropic\r\norganisations embedded within socio-cultural institutions engaged in welfare while\r\nreproducing dependent security and engendering Faustian bargains.

For many years electro-hydraulic actuators in a Stewart platform configuration have been found to best meet the performance requirements. However, valve-controlled actuators are very inefficient leading to a large power consumption, and also the need for a substantial cooling system to remove waste energy (heat) from the hydraulic oil. This paper describes a new design of motion system that uses a controlled brushless motor for each actuator, with power transmission via directly driven pumps to conventional simulator hydraulic cylinders. Accumulators are used to store and later recycle high pressure oil when actuators retract. In this way, power consumption has been dramatically reduced (for example from 45kW to 5kW during one representative motion waveform), while retaining the proven characteristics of the cylinder drive. Power consumption is lower, by a factor of between 2 and 4, than an equivalent all-electric solution. The motion system will be supplied for the first time with Boeing 787 simulators to be delivered in 2008. Design details are given in this paper, together with predicted and measured power consumption during a variety of representative cyclic motions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cleasby, K G","Plummer, Andrew R"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931561,"sim:weight":0.228015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573375,"sim:weight":0.222765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33709,"sim:weight":0.207132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86116,"sim:weight":0.202158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28485,"sim:weight":0.168553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28486,"sim:weight":0.167368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931258,"sim:weight":0.167104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.164516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108820,"sim:weight":0.15757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59004,"sim:weight":0.153241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51544,"sim:weight":0.151904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57236,"sim:weight":0.148297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is most evident when looking at operons, these often encoding enzymes involved in the same metabolic pathway or proteins from the same complex. Is gene order within operons nonrandom, however, and if so why? We examine this issue using metabolic operons as a case study. Using the metabolic network of Escherichia coli, we define the temporal order of reactions. We find a pronounced trend for genes to appear in operons in the same order as they are needed in metabolism (colinearity). This is paradoxical as, at steady state, enzymes abundance should be independent of order within the operon. We consider three extensions of the steady-state model that could potentially account for colinearity: (1) increased productivity associated with higher expression levels of the most 59 genes, (2) a faster metabolic processing immediately after up-regulation, and (3) metabolic stalling owing to stochastic protein loss. We establish the validity of these hypotheses by employing deterministic and stochastic models of enzyme kinetics. The stochastic stalling hypothesis correctly and uniquely predicts that colinearity is more pronounced both for lowly expressed operons and for genes that are not physically adjacent. The alternative models fail to find any support. These results support the view that stochasticity is a pervasive problem to a cell and that gene order evolution can be driven by the selective consequences of fluctuations in protein levels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kovacs,  K.","Hurst, Laurence D","Papp,  B."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2812773,"sim:weight":0.26112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26072,"sim:weight":0.184209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332856,"sim:weight":0.16891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, they fail to take advantage of new technologies and technological practices.\r\n\r\nThe article introduces a framework for Web adaptability, which encourages the development of Web-based services that can be resilient to the diversity of uses of such services, the target audience, available resources, technical innovations, organisational policies and relevant definitions of \u0027accessibility\u0027.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eMethod\u003c/strong\u003e \r\n\r\nThe article refers to a series of author-focussed approaches to accessibility through which the authors and others have struggled to find ways to promote accessibility for people with disabilities. These approaches depend upon the resource author\u0027s determination of the anticipated users\u0027 needs and their provision. Through approaches labelled as 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, the authors have widened their focus to account for contexts and individual differences in target audiences. Now, the authors want to recognise the role of users in determining their engagement with resources (including services). To distinguish this new approach, the term \u0027adaptability\u0027 has been used to replace \u0027accessibility\u0027; new definitions of accessibility have been adopted, and the authors have reviewed their previous work to clarify how it is relevant to the new approach.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eResults\u003c/strong\u003e \r\n\r\nAccessibility 1.0 is here characterised as a technical approach in which authors are told how to construct resources for a broadly defined audience. This is known as universal design. Accessibility 2.0 was introduced to point to the need to account for the context in which resources would be used, to help overcome inadequacies identified in the purely technical approach. Accessibility 3.0 moved the focus on users from a homogenised universal definition to recognition of the idiosyncratic needs and preferences of individuals and to cater for them. All of these approaches placed responsibility within the authoring/publishing domain without recognising the role the user might want to play, or the roles that other users in social networks, or even Web services might play.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eConclusions\u003c/strong\u003e \r\n\r\nAdaptability shifts the emphasis and calls for greater freedom for the users to facilitate individual accessibility in the open Web environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kelly, Brian","Nevile, Liddy","Sloan, David","Fanou, Sotiris","Ellison, Ruth","Herrod, Lisa"],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1573425,"sim:weight":0.601705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.260642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":702308,"sim:weight":0.232763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316484,"sim:weight":0.198342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.19417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Sensors on-board existing imaging satellites such as MSG and CALIPSO provide good horizontal and vertical resolution, respectively, and therefore the resolution of any dust products derived solely from one sensor will be limited in the same manner as the sensor. We propose a new method of identifying dust distributions in the atmosphere using data from two separate satellite sources, the SEVIRI on-board MSG and the CALIPSO lidar.

The advantages of this approach are demonstrated in echocardiographic boundary detection and in comparison with other techniques. The first stage of many automated echocardiographic image interpretation schemes is filtering to reduce the amount of speckle noise. The authors show how the two-dimensional least mean squares (TDLMS) filter can be configured as a motion-compensated filter for a time sequence of ultrasound images that eliminates the blurring associated with direct averaging. For an image corrupted by multiplicative speckle noise, the mode of the intensity distribution approximates the maximum likelihood estimator. In consequence, the temporal filter\u0027s output is biased towards the mode from the mean, using information contained within the speckle itself. A new adaptive algorithm for controlling the filter\u0027s convergence is also included. To evaluate performance, application to simulated, phantom, and an in vivo test sequence of the carotid artery are considered in comparison with other techniques. The effect of filtering on edges is of great importance, as these are used by subsequent image interpretation schemes. Quantitative measurements demonstrate the effectiveness of the Biased TDLMS filter, for both noise reduction and edge preservation. Echocardiographic images have a high noise content and suffer from poor contrast. Despite this challenging environment, the Biased TDLMS filter is shown to produce images that are better inputs for subsequent feature extraction.

That some exons have premature termination codons at fixation is paradoxical: why make a transcript if it is only to be destroyed? One model supposes that splicing is inherently noisy and spurious transcripts are common. The evolution of a premature termination codon in a regularly made unwanted transcript can be a means to prevent costly translation. Alternatively, nonsense-mediated decay can be regulated under certain conditions so the presence of a premature termination codon can be a means to up-regulate transcripts needed when nonsense-mediated decay is suppressed. \u003cb\u003eResults:\u003c/b\u003e To resolve this issue we examined the properties of putative nonsense-mediated decay targets in humans and mice. We started with a well-annotated set of protein coding genes and found that 2 to 4% of genes are probably subject to nonsense-mediated decay, and that the premature termination codon reflects neither rare mutations nor sequencing artefacts. Several lines of evidence suggested that the noisy splicing model has considerable relevance: 1) exons that are uniquely found in nonsense-mediated decay transcripts (nonsense-mediated decay-specific exons) tend to be newly created; 2) have low-inclusion level; 3) tend not to be a multiple of three long; 4) belong to genes with multiple splice isoforms more often than expected; and 5) these genes are not obviously enriched for any functional class nor conserved as nonsense-mediated decay candidates in other species. However, nonsense-mediated decay-specific exons for which distant orthologous exons can be found tend to have been under purifying selection, consistent with the regulation model. \u003cb\u003eConclusion:\u003c/b\u003e We conclude that for recently evolved exons the noisy splicing model is the better explanation of their properties, while for ancient exons the nonsense-mediated decay regulated gene expression is a viable explanation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhang,  Z.

While the interdisciplinary field of Human-Computer Interaction has been described as a ‘design-oriented field of research’, it has been argued that our understanding of design is relatively poor.  The process of design has been described as involving a certain ‘mystical element’.  The ‘mystical element’ of the process of design has been described using terms such as ‘creativity’.  With a poor understanding, it is hard to know how best to support creativity.  This could impact the processes and outcomes of design.  This thesis attempts to increase our understanding of creativity in design, thereby increasing our knowledge of how best to support the creative design process.  \r\n\r\nThe thesis develops an understanding of creativity in the forms of a definition of creativity, metrics and measures of creativity and an understanding of the creative process as it is expressed in the activity of design.  These contributions are developed throughout the thesis building upon theoretical work and are refined reflecting upon our practical studies.  Furthermore, we develop an understanding of how to support creativity in design by eliciting requirements for creativity support tools, based upon our theoretical work and practical studies.  The application of these requirements are reflected upon and illustrated through the evaluation of an existing support tool and the design, development and evaluation of our own creativity support tool: Public Social Private Design (PSPD).","bibo:AuthorList":["Warr, Andrew M"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Several members of the RASSF family are frequently epigenetically inactivated in cancer, however, their role in leukaemia has remained largely uninvestigated. Also, RASSF10 is a predicted gene yet to be experimentally verified. Here we cloned, characterised and demonstrated expression of RASSF10 in normal human bone marrow.

We find all three variables are jointly determined under a cross-sectional framework of simultaneous equation analysis. However, when taking into account unobserved firm-specific effects under a panel data framework, we find only that firm value and the largest shareholder’s ownership are jointly determined, although managerial ownership still affects firm value in a linearly positive way. Firm value has positive effects on the largest shareholder’s ownership, while the largest shareholder ownership is found to have an inverse-“U” shape influence on firm value. To further allow for ultimate ownership in the relation, we use cross-sectional data and find the separation between cash flow rights and voting rights is negatively related to firm value. This proves the coexistence of the incentive alignment effect (embodied by cash flow rights) and the entrenchment effect (embodied by voting rights). Finally, by using a dynamic random effect probit model to allow for unobserved firm heterogeneity, dynamic factors and endogeneity of initial conditions, we explore the occurrence mechanism of the largest shareholder’s tunneling. We find that tunneling of the largest shareholder is rather persistent during sample years. Firms with longer listing histories and higher debt levels are more likely to suffer from tunneling problems. Firms located in western area of China are more likely to be tunneled by their controlling shareholders. We find government policy against such behavior becomes more and more effective. From local authorities’ perspective, however, we only find an insignificant negative role for the local unemployment rate. On the other hand, local fiscal deficit has insignificantly positive relation to tunneling occurrence, reflecting the tax evasion nature of tunneling","bibo:AuthorList":["Yao, Yun"],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Values intrinsic to AngloAmerican\r\ncapitalism were not directly being transmitted down the policy chain; however, work socialisation values were. The students were able to distinguish between their own personal values and those of business organisations; their personal values often conflicted with those of business. Factors extraneous to education, for example, students’ parttime\r\njobs appear to have a greater influence over their knowledge of business values than that of their teachers.

The role of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase within T lymphocyte migration is unclear, with some evidence that it may be a disposable signal. Here, using Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the T cell line CEM cells, the role of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase and its downstream kinases was investigated. CCL22 mediated CEM cell migration and CXCL12 mediated peripheral blood mononuclear cell migration were shown to be independent of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase using several different broad-spectrum Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors. However, these cells were Akt-dependent, as demonstrated by incubation with the Akt inhibitor Akti-1/2. Differences in the effect of the inhibitors on Akt activity were discovered, indicating that either Akt can be activated in the absence of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase, or differences exist regarding the relative abundance of each protein within the cell. Th17 cells are a subtype of the T helper cell family and have been shown to be involved in inflammation and immune diseases. Mouse splenocytes were polarised to a Th17 phenotype and analysed for the surface expression of chemokine receptors. CCR2, CCR6 and CCR9 were shown to be expressed on Th17 cells and upregulated under Th17 polarising conditions. However, only CCR2 and CCR6 induced migration of Th17 cells. This migration was sensitive to Phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt inhibitors. This data reveals a model for the migration of Th17 cells to areas of inflammation, and sheds light on the role of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase during this process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Webb, Adam"],"dc:date":"2009-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.196205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.135539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first of these is inspired by perceptual organisation;\r\nwhereas, the second is based on agglomerative clustering of image\r\nprimitives. This thesis argues the benefits and drawbacks of each image description\r\nand empirically show why the second is more suitable in capturing object\r\nstrucutures. The value of graph theory is demonstrated in extracting object\r\nstructures, especially from the second type of image description. User interaction\r\nduring the structure extraction process is also made possible via an image\r\nhierarchy editor.\r\nTwo applications of object structures are studied in depth. On the computer\r\nvision side, the problem of object classification is investigated. In particular,\r\nthis thesis shows that it is possible to classify objects regardless of their depictive\r\nstyles. This classification problem is approached using a graph theoretic\r\nparadigm; by encoding object structures as feature vectors of fixed lengths, object\r\nclassification can then be treated as a clustering problem in structural feature\r\nspace and that actual clustering can be done using conventional machine learning\r\ntechniques.\r\nThe benefits of object structures in computer graphics are demonstrated from a\r\nNon-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) point of view. In particular, it is shown that\r\ntopological object structures deliver an appropriate degree of abstraction that\r\noften appears in well-known abstract artworks. Moreover, the value of shape\r\nsimplification is demonstrated in the process of making abstract art. By integrating\r\nobject structures and simple geometric shapes, it is shown that artworks\r\nproduced in child-like paintings and from artists such as Wassily Kandinsky, Joan\r\nMiro and Henri Matisse can be synthesised and by doing so, the current gamut\r\nof NPR styles is extended.

These are made from various observational techniques and model comparisons.\r\n\r\nA focus of the work is the two-day wave at high latitudes in the MLT region.  This has revealed significant wave amplitudes in both summer and winter.  However, these waves are shown to have very different origins.  Using satellite data, the summertime wave is found to be the classic quasi-two-day wave which maximises at mid-latitudes in the MLT region.  The wintertime wave is found to be a mesospheric manifestation of an eastward-propagating wave originating in the stratosphere and likely generated by barotropic and baroclinic instabilities in the polar night jet.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal winds from Meteor and MF radars have been used to measure and produce climatologies of the Lunar M2 tide at Esrange in the Arctic (68°N), Rothera and Davis in the Antarctic (68°S), Castle Eaton at mid-latitude (52°N) and Ascension Island at Equatorial latitudes (8°S).  These observations present the longest period of lunar semi-diurnal tidal observations in the MLT region to date, with a 16-year dataset from the UK meteor radar.  Comparisons with the Vial and Forbes (1994) lunar tidal model are also made which reveal generally good agreement.\r\n\r\nNon-migrating lunar tides have been investigated.  This uses lunar tidal results from equatorial stations, including the Ascension Island (8°S) meteor radar.  Also lunar tidal results from the Rothera meteor wind radar (68°S, 68°W) and the Davis MF radar (68°S, 78°E) are considered.  Both of these stations are on the edge of the Antarctic continent.  It is demonstrated that there are often consistent tidal phase offsets between similar latitude stations.  This suggests that non-migrating modes are likely to be present in the lunar semi-diurnal tidal structure and have significant amplitudes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sandford, David J"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9001161,"sim:weight":0.539809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711222,"sim:weight":0.500159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002494,"sim:weight":0.435163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711813,"sim:weight":0.427861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710566,"sim:weight":0.423534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708669,"sim:weight":0.402354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":712180,"sim:weight":0.398353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002057,"sim:weight":0.38787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001346,"sim:weight":0.380168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710672,"sim:weight":0.373043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708667,"sim:weight":0.366594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708175,"sim:weight":0.360474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710309,"sim:weight":0.355717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":712189,"sim:weight":0.352245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710310,"sim:weight":0.350099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":712054,"sim:weight":0.343478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":707780,"sim:weight":0.3425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710342,"sim:weight":0.338465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708668,"sim:weight":0.323594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710568,"sim:weight":0.323522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Architects are already using computers to construct complex three dimensional geometric models of their buildings and are beginning to analyse these models using environmental and structural software, a development which raises new questions about the role of architects and engineers. \r\nThis dissertation puts forward the hypothesis that architects will at times need to be actively involved in computer programming by writing or modifying software. The hypothesis is based on the assumption that the form of a building and its spatial configuration are influenced by the nature of the design process itself. If architects are to have a complete and subtle control over design and to identify their own personal aesthetic language, they must also have control over the design process including the way computer software tools are developed and used. \r\nThe hypothesis is tested using the example of a ferry terminal, a building type whose function is largely dominated by passenger circulation.  Even thought passengers have a very straightforward aim to reach their final destination, the rules governing the way passengers move around the building are complex and a single computer program will not be able to cover all possible aspects of such behaviour. Thus, architects must have the freedom to formulate different rules and study the effects they have on their design. This particularly applies in non-emergency situations when each individual moves inside the building according to different needs and desires.    \r\nA program was written which runs in real time so that the architect can see the effect of changing the parameters that control the process. The program can be used as evaluation mechanism to study the performance of postulated design or it can be use as creative mechanism where the design may emerge out of the process in the same way that animals create paths in the woods. Either way, the general aim is to optimize the design according to criteria over which the architect, again, must have complete control.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kontovourkis, Odysseas"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.330001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An older animal that is not being cognitively challenged may be in a sufficiently stable environment that reducing the delay before action at the cost of also reducing learning capacity may be a sensible tradeoff. I support parts of this model by matching a simulation of it to known reaction-time results, and by providing an account for previously unexplained task-learning results in adult and aged macaques.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bryson, Joanna J"],"dc:date":"2009-07-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84618,"sim:weight":0.303597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86113,"sim:weight":0.274017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87106,"sim:weight":0.22657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.217352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.202919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.172115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26082,"sim:weight":0.16348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85026,"sim:weight":0.161498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Most studies have employed either simple synthetic populations with restricted allelic variation or performed association mapping on a sample of naturally occurring haplotypes. Both of these approaches have some limitations, therefore alternative resources for the genetic dissection of complex traits continue to be sought. Here we describe one such alternative, the Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC). This approach is expected to improve the precision with which QTL can be mapped, improving the outlook for QTL cloning. Here, we present the first panel of MAGIC lines developed: a set of 527 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) descended from a heterogeneous stock of 19 intermated accessions of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These lines and the 19 founders were genotyped with 1,260 single nucleotide polymorphisms and phenotyped for development-related traits. Analytical methods were developed to fine-map quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the MAGIC lines by reconstructing the genome of each line as a mosaic of the founders. We show by simulation that QTL explaining 10% of the phenotypic variance will be detected in most situations with an average mapping error of about 300 kb, and that if the number of lines were doubled the mapping error would be under 200 kb. We also show how the power to detect a QTL and the mapping accuracy vary, depending on QTL location. We demonstrate the utility of this new mapping population by mapping several known QTL with high precision and by finding novel QTL for germination data and bolting time. Our results provide strong support for similar ongoing efforts to produce MAGIC lines in other organisms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kover, Paula X","Valdar,  W.","Trakalo,  J.","Scarcelli,  N.","Ehrenreich,  I.

{"identifier":2803683,"ep:Repository":82,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Active Flow Control on a Nonslender Delta Wing","bibo:abstract":"The effects of active flow control by oscillatory blowing at the leading edge of a nonslender delta wing with a Λ\u003d50° sweep angle have been investigated. Pressure measurements and Particle Image Velocimetry measurements were conducted on a half wing to investigate the formation of leading edge vortices for oscillatory blowing, compared to the stalled flow for the no blowing case. Stall has been delayed by up to 8, and significant increases in the upper surface suction force have been observed. Velocity measurements show that shear layer reattachment is promoted with forcing, and a vortex flow pattern develops. The time averaged location of the centre of the vortical region moves outboard with increased excitation. The near-surface flow pattern obtained from the PIV measurements shows reattachment in the forward part of the wing. There is no measurable jet-like axial flow in the vortex core, which seems to break down at or very near the apex. This highlights that unlike slender delta wings, vortex breakdown is not a limiting factor in the generation of lift for nonslender delta wings. Phase averaged measurements reveal the perturbation due to the pulsed blowing, its interaction with the shear layer and vortex, apparent displacement of the vortex core, and relaxation of the reattachment region. The flow in a phase averaged sense is highly three dimensional. Experiments indicate that unsteady blowing at Strouhal numbers in the region of St\u003d0.5 to St\u003d0.75, and in the region of St\u003d1.25 to St\u003d1.5 can be a highly effective. Reattached flow can develop from stalled flow after pulsing has been initiated with a time constant of tU/c\u003d5 for unsteady blowing at St\u003d0.75, and tU/c\u003d7 for St\u003d1.5. Experiments with excitation from finite span slots located in the forward half of the wing show that partial blowing can be more effective at low momentum coefficients. Force measurements of a full delta wing confirmed that the effectiveness of this method of flow control was not only confined to half delta wings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Nathan M"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1573428,"sim:weight":0.701784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573429,"sim:weight":0.60674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2805727,"sim:weight":0.473912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393880,"sim:weight":0.385472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8795269,"sim:weight":0.382784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573427,"sim:weight":0.372237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25814,"sim:weight":0.351811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1574400,"sim:weight":0.331602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29316,"sim:weight":0.328225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87921,"sim:weight":0.312034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.311902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28174,"sim:weight":0.291604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26771,"sim:weight":0.269802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268054,"sim:weight":0.269267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108393,"sim:weight":0.254647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24687,"sim:weight":0.244057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26767,"sim:weight":0.237453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27227,"sim:weight":0.232182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84766,"sim:weight":0.228495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28172,"sim:weight":0.211899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It argues that existing approaches to the study of the role of religion in social mobilization have been insufficiently nuanced and have failed to probe the multiple and often contradictory influences that religion can have on mobilization channels. On the basis of three qualitative case studies, from Malaysia, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom, we identify three key ingredients for religion to act as a catalyst for social mobilization: theological resources, sacred spaces, and their interaction with the wider context. This leads us to conclude that the boundaries of the ‘religious’ dimension of social mobilization are fluid, and that the religious element of social mobilization can never be disentangled from its social and political context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Deneulin, Severine","Brown, Graham","Devine, Joseph"],"dc:date":"2009-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Given the changes in the social and political context, consideration of the subject of religion can no longer be avoided. The paper identifies two implications of this for development studies. First, the assumptions of secularization and secularism that supposedly define the relationships between religion, society, and politics have to be revisited. Second, development studies must recognize that religion is dynamic and heterogeneous. Both development studies and religion are concerned with the meaning of “progress” or a “better life,” implying that attention has to be given to social and historical processes of meaning creation, requiring a shift from positivist to interpretivist research methods.

The unique selling point is they enable the mobile learner to effectively and efficiently connect to a electronic resource or activity from a physical object.\r\n\r\nThere has been growing interest in how QR codes might be used to enhance the learning experience in UK HE/FE. Many of these ideas and discussions are being coordinated through a JISC Innovation Grant led by the University of Bath. This paper will develop a number of user case scenarios based on the dreams generated at the initial Ideas Factory Workshops which ran at 6 HE/FE institutions during January 2009 (http://blogs.bath.ac.uk/qrcode). Some of the dreams include using QR Codes in Student Induction, accessing just in time learning materials in lectures, and closing the feedback loop for design students at their end of a year design show.\r\n\r\nAfter exposing these dreams the discussion will turn to \"how to ensure these dreams become a reality?\" This will be informed by the lessons learnt from the implementation at the University of Bath, and the results from a student survey (sample \u003d 1800) on QR Code awareness and habits (Ramsden \u0026 Jordan (2009)). For instance, 1 in 10 students were aware of QR Codes but only 1 in 20 had accessed one. So given this exposure to QR codes how do we implement them at the institutional level to ensure success? The outcome is a scalable and sustainable support and development model where responsibilities for key central and local support teams are designed in. This model includes the coordination of face to face events, online events and the emergence of the QR Code Information Hub (http://bath.ac.uk/barcodes). It will be suggested that this current solution is not perfect. However, through listening to users and implementing through cross-institutional teams, including the Students\u0027 Union it will lay the foundations for future success.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ramsden, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1584848,"sim:weight":0.699456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.329223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.325013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.317792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341327,"sim:weight":0.313366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85672,"sim:weight":0.308213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9631121,"sim:weight":0.267234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.254901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While it has offered a new route to measuring utility for economists, SWB has revealed “puzzles and paradoxes” in relating it to income. Wellbeing is an holistic concept which seeks to engage with understanding people’s lives as they are lived in society. But the analytical boundaries between the social sciences thwart such an enquiry. After reviewing key findings on work and income for their connection to social dimensions, this paper reviews writings of key contributors to the SWB literature – Layard and Sen – and traces the problem to the use of the analytical concept of the self-regulating market. Polanyi’s The Great Transformation argues that the idea of the market as a self-regulating mechanism itself drove the promotion of a laissez-faire economy, so becoming detached from society. Polanyi contends that the concept of the market has itself to be re-embedded in wider society if we are to understand the means through which provisioning of needs takes place. Polanyi’s concept of the institutedness of the economy through reciprocity and redistribution as well as exchange provides a useful starting point for this investigation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, S."],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":71879,"sim:weight":0.367714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.285772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53524,"sim:weight":0.227716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.196252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71910,"sim:weight":0.183453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Hence, choosing profitable custom instructions that are also area-time efficient is essential if design constraints must be met by field-programmable-gate-array (FPGA)-based reconfigurable processors. In this paper, we propose a framework for FPGA-based reconfigurable processors in order to rapidly identify a reduced set of profitable custom instructions without the need for actual hardware synthesis. The proposed framework is capable of estimating the area utilization and latencies of custom instructions on lookup-table-based commercial FPGAs. Simulations based on 15 applications from benchmark suites show that the proposed method provides, on average, an area reduction of over 29% for loss of mere 1.3% in compute performance. Our evaluations also confirm that the proposed framework is superior to an existing area-optimization approach that relies on exploiting the regularity of custom instruction data paths. In particular, an average area-time product gain of over 59% was achieved by deploying a reduced set of custom instructions obtained using the proposed framework.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lam, S K","Srikanthan, T","Clarke, C T"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":80580,"sim:weight":0.26205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998856,"sim:weight":0.243807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5575412,"sim:weight":0.185668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5841021,"sim:weight":0.17242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5843492,"sim:weight":0.166237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80590,"sim:weight":0.158194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651709,"sim:weight":0.145196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512741,"sim:weight":0.124594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Though the use of traditional vernacular techniques, such as cob, adobe and rammed earth, have raised the profile of earthen architecture, wider impact on modern construction is likely to come from modern innovations such as extruded unfired masonry units. A large driver behind the move to earth masonry is the significant reduction in embodied energy when compared to fired bricks and concrete blockwork, and the passive environmental control provided by clay. This paper summarises results of extensive testing on commercial mass produced extruded unfired clay bricks. The focus of this paper is to investigate the properties affecting the compressive strength of these building products. Both theoretical models and test results demonstrate that the clay content plays a large role in defining the compressive strength of these materials. The reduction in strength with increases in moisture content are similar for different material sources and these strength reductions are unlikely to cause problems under normal operating conditions, even at high relative humidity and in shower rooms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heath, Andrew","Lawrence, Mike","Walker, Peter","Fourie, Clyde"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66330,"sim:weight":0.323224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65969,"sim:weight":0.305974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176859,"sim:weight":0.291947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65716,"sim:weight":0.281756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60658,"sim:weight":0.166937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316479,"sim:weight":0.154574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573417,"sim:weight":0.146975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340554,"sim:weight":0.144066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study showed that poor detailing or an inadequate thickness of render resulted in significant water damage to the underlying straw, and that the use of breathable paints made a small difference to the breathability of the render. Where detailing and thickness were adequate, the study showed that the render provided an effective barrier to wind driven rain whilst still allowing the wall to ‘breathe’.

This paper considers one approach to both these problems, namely writing entirely in C.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fitch, J P","Ganzha, V G","Rudenko, V M","Vorozhtsov, E V"],"dc:date":"1992","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53645,"sim:weight":0.197563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57289,"sim:weight":0.196106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.177178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23402,"sim:weight":0.158805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

By the term\r\nphysical modelling, we refer to the simulation of sound\r\nproduction mechanism of a musical instrument, which is modelled with reference to the physics using wave-guides. One of the fundamental parameters of such a physical model is the pitch, and so pitch period estimation is one of the first tasks of any analysis of such a model.\r\nIn this paper, an algorithm based on the Dyadic Wavelet\r\nTransform has been investigated for pitch detection of musical signals. The wavelet transform is simply the convolution of a signal f(t) with a dialated and translated version of a single function called the mother wavelet that has to satisfy certain requirements. There are a wide variety of possible wavelets, but not all are appropriate for pitch detection. The performance of both linear phase wavelets (Haar, Morlet, and the spline wavelet) and minimum phase wavelets (Daubechies’ wavelets) have been investigated. The algorithm proposed here has proved to be\r\nsimple, accurate, and robust to noise; it also has the potential of acceptable speed. A comparative study between this algorithm and the well-known autocorrelation function is also given. Finally, illustrative examples of different real guitar tones and other sound signals are given using the proposed algorithm.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fitch, J.","Shabana, W.","Tro, J.","Larsson, M."],"dc:date":"1999-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Although the use of traditional vernacular techniques, such as cob, adobe and rammed earth, have raised the profile of earthen architecture, wider impact on modern construction is likely to come from modern innovations such as extruded unfired masonry units. A large driver behind the move to unfired clay masonry is the significant reduction in embodied energy when compared with fired bricks and concrete blockwork, and the passive environmental control provided by clay. This paper summarises the results of extensive testing on commercial mass-produced extruded unfired clay bricks. The focus of this study was to investigate the properties affecting the compressive strength of these building products. Both theoretical models and test results demonstrate that the clay content plays a large role in defining the compressive strength of these materials. The reduction in strength with increases in moisture content are similar for different material sources and these strength reductions are unlikely to cause problems under normal operating conditions, even at relative humidity levels up to 95%.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heath, Andrew","Walker, Peter","Fourie, Clyde","Lawrence, Mike"],"dc:date":"2009-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176859,"sim:weight":0.246002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66330,"sim:weight":0.216876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65969,"sim:weight":0.176539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65716,"sim:weight":0.164261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340554,"sim:weight":0.131052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316479,"sim:weight":0.123027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573417,"sim:weight":0.116439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Test results confirmed that the panels exceeded current design requirements for racking shear and identified the mechanism whereby this occurred. The panels are considered suitable for future applications in low-rise structural walling solutions.

The inverse temperature is picked proportionally to the logarithm of the particle density. We identify the free energy per particle in terms of a variational formula and show that this formula exhibits a cascade of phase transitions as the temperature parameter ranges from zero to infinity. Loosely speaking, the particle system separates into spatially distant components in such a way that within each phase all components are of the same size, which is the larger the lower the temperature. The main tool in our proof is a new large deviation principle for sparse point configurations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Collevecchio, A.","Konig, W.","Morters, Peter","Sidorova, Nadia"],"dc:date":"2010-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84847,"sim:weight":0.251617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5847589,"sim:weight":0.214386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28947,"sim:weight":0.212397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108049,"sim:weight":0.183792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.170517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85525,"sim:weight":0.161864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.159773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Studies have been extensively carried out over the years to achieve this pricing goal. Few methodologies can directly link nodal generation/demand increment to network long-run marginal/incremental costs. Even fewer consider network security in their pricing methodologies, considering it is one of the most important cost drivers. All networks are designed to be able to withstand credible contingencies, but this comes at a significant cost to network development. This paper proposes a new approach that can establish the direct link between nodal generation/demand increment and changes in investment cost while ensuring network security. The investment cost is reflected by the change in the spare capacity of a network asset from a nodal injection, which is in turn translated into an investment horizon, leading to the change in the present value of a future investment cost. The security is reflected in the pricing through a full N - 1 contingency analysis to define the maximum allowed power flow along each circuit, from which the time horizon of future investment is determined. This paper illustrates the implementation of the proposed pricing model for a system whose demand grows either at a uniform rate or at variable growth rates. The benefits of introducing security into the long-run pricing model are demonstrated on the IEEE 14-busbar system and a practical 87-busbar distribution network.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heng,  H.

{"identifier":2804313,"ep:Repository":82,"dc:type":["Articles","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Framework for assessing the economic efficiencies of long-run network pricing models","bibo:abstract":"This paper presents a framework for assessing the economic efficiency of different long-run network pricing models. The aim is to provide a quantifiable efficiency measure that will inform regulators, network operators, and network users when an alternative pricing model is contemplated. The efficiency measure is derived from the long-term network development costs that flow from a dynamic interaction between network pricing and planning; that is the response of network users to differing charging models, the consequential network investment, and new financial incentives that follow reinforcement of the network. To illustrate the approach, the framework has been used to assess the relative efficiency of three broad class of distribution pricing models in a study undertaken for the Great Britain (GB)\u0027s regulator for gas and electricity markets in England, Wales, and Scotland-Ofgem. The study contemplated three pricing models that are used in practice. The efficiency assessment in the Ofgem study was conducted on a pseudo distribution reference network. On the assumption that the results from the reference network could be scaled up to the national level, then the assessment suggests that by moving from the present DRM model to the more economic LRIC approach, GB distribution network operators could save in the region of 200 pound m over the next 20 years in their network investment costs. This paper draws heavily on the project undertaken for Ofgem, but any views expressed are solely those of the authors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Li,  F. L.","Tolley,  D.","Padhy,  N.

Lizards of the family Lacertidae  have been identified as reservoir hosts of B. lusitaniae. These reptiles are highly structured geographically, indicating limited migration. In order to examine whether host geographic structure shapes the evolution and epidemiology of B. lusitaniae, we analyzed the phylogeographic population structure of this tick-borne bacterium using a recently developed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on chromosomal housekeeping genes. A total of 2,099 questing nymphal and adult Ixodes ricinus ticks were collected in two climatically different regions of Portugal, being ~130 km apart. All ticks were screened for spirochetes by direct PCR. Attempts to isolate strains yielded 16 cultures of B. lusitaniae in total. Uncontaminated cultures as well as infected ticks were included in this study. The results using MLST show that the regional B. lusitaniae populations constitute genetically distinct populations. In contrast, no clear phylogeographic signals were detected in sequences of the commonly used molecular markers ospA and ospC. The pronounced population structure of B. lusitaniae over a short geographic distance as captured by MLST of the housekeeping genes suggests that the migration rates of B. lusitaniae are rather low, most likely because the distribution of mediterranean lizard populations is highly parapatric. The study underlines the importance of vertebrate hosts in the geographic spread of tick-borne microparasites.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vitorino, Liliana R.","Margos, Gabriele","Feil, Edward J","Collares-Pereira, Margarida","Zé-Zé, Libia","Kurtenbach, Klaus","Ahmed, Niyaz"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2812587,"sim:weight":0.371136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2812777,"sim:weight":0.177531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32132,"sim:weight":0.148616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25053,"sim:weight":0.110981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.104695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.10439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.103237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86227,"sim:weight":0.0902125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Ascaris suum is a gastrointestinal parasite of pigs; in addition to its veterinary significance it is a good model of the human parasite Ascaris lumbricoides, estimated to infect ~1.4 billion people globally. Anthelmintic drugs are essential to control nematode parasites, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on nerve and muscle are the targets of cholinergic anthelmintics such as levamisole and pyrantel. Previous genetic analyses of nematode nAChRs have been confined to Caenorhabditis elegans, which is phylogenetically distinct from Ascaris spp.  and many other important parasites. Here we report the cloning and expression of two nAChR subunit cDNAs from A. suum. The subunits are very similar in sequence to C. elegans UNC-29 and UNC-38, are expressed on muscle cells and can be expressed robustly in Xenopus  oocytes to form acetylcholine-, nicotine-, levamisole- and pyrantel-sensitive channels. We also demonstrate that changing the stoichiometry of the receptor by injecting different ratios of the subunit cRNAs can reproduce two of the three pharmacological subtypes of nAChR present in A. suum muscle cells. When the ratio was 5:1 (Asu-unc-38:Asu-unc-29), nicotine was a full agonist and levamisole was a partial agonist, and oocytes responded to oxantel, but not pyrantel. At the reverse ratio (1:5 Asu-unc-38:Asu-unc-29), levamisole was a full agonist and nicotine was a partial agonist, and the oocytes responded to pyrantel, but not oxantel. These results represent the first in vitro expression of any parasitic nicotinic receptor and show that their properties are substantially different from those of C. elegans. The results also show that changing the expression level of a single receptor subunit dramatically altered the efficacy of some anthelmintic drugs. In vitro expression of these subunits may permit the development of parasite-specific screens for future anthelmintics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williamson, Sally M","Robertson, Alan P.","Brown, Laurence","Williams, Tracey","Woods, Debra J.","Martin, Richard J.","Sattelle, David B.","Wolstenholme, Adrian","Maule, Aaron"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2813644,"sim:weight":0.375616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513163,"sim:weight":0.241454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45093,"sim:weight":0.183512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81130,"sim:weight":0.160483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80098,"sim:weight":0.160316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.156049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268784,"sim:weight":0.141313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23996,"sim:weight":0.128477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81076,"sim:weight":0.0989629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study investigates one major issue impeding the rural electrification programmes in rural Kenya: high connection payments. The paper uses estimates obtained from a stated preference study, namely a contingent valuation method completed in 2007, to examine the willingness to pay to connect to grid-electricity and photovoltaic services. Expanding rural electrification will need subsidies, but the study shows that some forms of subsidy are more effective than others. The key findings suggest that the government needs to reform the energy subsidies, increase market ownership and performance of private suppliers, establish financial schemes and create markets that vary according to social-economic and demographic groups.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abdullah, Sabah","Markandya, Anil"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, access and costs of connecting to this service for most poor in these countries is inconceivable. Policies promoting electricity connection in rural areas are known to be beneficial in improving the socio-economic and health well-being for households. This paper examines willingness to pay (WTP) for rural electrification connection in Kisumu district, Kenya, using the contingent valuation method (CVM). A nonparametric and a parametric model are employed to estimate WTP values for two electricity products: grid electricity (GE) and photovoltaic (PV) electricity. The results indicate that respondents are willing to pay more for GE services than PV and households favoured monthly connection payments over a lump sum amount. Some of the policies suggested in this paper include: subsidizing the connection costs for both sources of electricity, adjusting the payment periods, and restructuring the market ownership of providing rural electricity services.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abdullah, Sabah","Jeanty, P.W."],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Researchers frequently highlight that whatever the\r\nresearched phenomena, it is important to consider actors’ subjective views of the world. The\r\nconcept of Network Pictures as introduced in the IMP (Industrial Marketing and Purchasing)\r\nbody of literature by Ford et al. (2002b), refers to those subjective views and despite its\r\nrecognised importance no in-depth research had been conducted so far on the concept which\r\nhas thus remained blurred. Ford et al. (2002b) brought in this concept to emphasise that the\r\nnetwork is in fact a varying thing depending on what people see. The question is whether this\r\ncan be translated into a research device, so that researchers may see in a structured and\r\nanalytical way what an actor’s picture is. This is what this research project is about.\r\nThe concept’s theoretical foundations are uncovered by reviewing some principles from\r\nSense-Making Theory. This review results most importantly in the identification of a close\r\nassociation between actors’ views of the world and the outcome of those actors’ sense\r\nmaking processes or frameworks. The relevance of actors’ views to obtain a clearer\r\nunderstanding of organisational networks is highlighted when the relation that is believed to\r\nexist between those views and action in organisational networks is addressed.\r\nWith the aim of developing Network Pictures as research tool a two-stage method is put\r\nforward and carried out. The method consisted of operationalising the construct of Network\r\nPictures and then testing it in two different network contexts to see if it was usable and useful\r\nfor carrying out research in organisational networks. The results point to the usability and\r\nusefulness of the developed device: not only does it allow for capturing what is believed to be\r\nindividuals’ views of the world in a rich and comprehensive way, as it also shows diversity\r\nbetween individuals in different contexts. Also and interestingly, some of the identified\r\n‘practitioner theories’ were found to be not coherent with some IMP theoretical cornerstones.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ramos, Carla"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

When implementing innovative products, organisations are\r\nfacing issues of how to measure and manage the performance of the products concerned\r\nand how to do so in a worthwhile way. Reviewing existing literature suggests that there has\r\nbeen limited research on the value of performance measurement and management\r\nprocesses and indeed little conceptual distinction has been made between performance\r\nmeasurement and performance management. A conceptual framework is developed,\r\nstructured around concepts from the existing literature showing two ways of distinguishing\r\nperformance measurement and performance management. Performance management\r\nprocesses are shown as broader than performance measurement processes and the\r\ninfluences of the processes on performance are also displayed, another way of\r\ndifferentiating between the two concepts. The framework provides a structure for a pattern\r\nmatching analysis using empirical data.\r\nEmpirical data collection involved four case studies, each focusing on a medical device\r\nbeing implemented in the UK public healthcare sector. Forty-six semi-structured\r\ninterviews explored performance measurement and performance management processes in\r\nthe implementation of the innovative products, as well as exploring the influences of those\r\nprocesses on performance of the innovative products. The findings from the thesis\r\nhighlight key performance measurement and performance management processes that\r\noccur in the implementation of innovative products, finding that the two can best be\r\ndistinguished by their influence, or lack of influence, on performance. Performance\r\nreporting is also highlighted as a key concept. The findings indicate that performance\r\nmeasurement and reporting processes alone cannot be expected to have an influence on\r\nperformance, however if performance management processes occur too then they can.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dickinson, Graham"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.432955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584823,"sim:weight":0.269029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.236788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53666,"sim:weight":0.184119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.145764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930474,"sim:weight":0.140759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I follow remittances from the giver’s motivations through\r\nto the receiver’s view of remittances and how the receiver uses them and finally to their\r\nimpact as a means of moderating the effect of negative shocks on the receiving household.\r\nResults show that parents remit to respondents for altruistic purposes, or for insurance\r\nmotivations (e.g. to help out the respondent if they are sick). Respondents remit to\r\nparents for altruistic motivations and inheritance. There is strong bi-directionality in the\r\nremittance flows. Children remit to respondents as an “insurance premium”, and for\r\ninheritance motivations. Altruism motivates respondents to give to their children. There is\r\nstrong evidence of co-insurance between respondents and their siblings with both\r\ninsurance payouts and premiums being paid. Respondents and their siblings also remit to\r\neach other for altruistic motivations.\r\nThere is strong evidence of “mental accounting” amongst both male and female headed\r\nhouseholds. Remittances exhibit a much lower MPC than salary and farming income. Male\r\nand female headed households differ in their use of income from different sources,\r\nhowever one result is consistent: remittances are used for education.\r\nProbit models indicate that households are more likely to receive remittances from local\r\nareas if someone in the household is sick (local remittances insure a health shock).\r\nHouseholds that suffer from drought are more likely to receive remittances from more\r\ndistant areas (other districts, a city, abroad). Drought has a major negative impact on\r\nconsumption levels but distant remittances insure affected households who suffer from\r\nthese. Local remittances, which make up most remittance flows, are unable to insure\r\nthese community shocks. Only around 10 per cent of households receive remittances from\r\noutside their home district however.

The reduction of these losses is achieved by redesigning\r\nthe high-index inclusions in the cladding structure to suppress cladding modes\r\nthat strongly couple to the fundamental core-guided mode when the �bre is\r\nbent.\r\nIn chapter 4, a method of tapering photonic crystal �bres in order to decrease\r\nthe dispersion along their length is described.

Significant attention is drawn to America’s racialised history and racebased\r\nsocial framework within which white ethnics categorically benefited from being\r\nclassified as ‘white’. Also examined are factors such as generational distance from the\r\npoint of immigration, language loss, upward mobility, and intermarriage, which together\r\nfacilitated the comprehensive assimilation of white ethnic groups into the majority white\r\npopulation in the decades leading up to the alleged “ethnic revival.” The upsurge in white\r\nethnic sentiment in the 1960s and 1970s is therefore argued to have transpired due to the\r\nchance convergence of a number of different factors, and given the continued\r\nclassification of Americans as belonging to one of five racial groups, this thesis\r\nconcludes that white ethnicities stand little chance of surviving in the long-run within a\r\nsociety in which race continues to hold significant sway.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ubeysekara, Ruwan"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85735,"sim:weight":0.292212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29199,"sim:weight":0.289809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109142,"sim:weight":0.261451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.233953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109002,"sim:weight":0.225997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.205939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108065,"sim:weight":0.155504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109071,"sim:weight":0.153824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.142655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The statistics of the parameters were analyzed as a function of time of year and rainfall intensity. From the raindrop size distribution data, the impact on attenuation at 20-40 GHz was investigated. A simple model to quantify the uncertainty of the raindrop size distribution has been created. Finally, we have shown qualitatively that differences between measured and modeled attenuation can partly be explained by uncertainty in the raindrop size distribution. Furthermore, we also show that although the model for mean attenuation is relatively constant, the standard deviation is much more variable even for sites in close proximity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Townsend,  A.

The pandemics occur when new human-transmissible viruses that have the major surface protein of influenza A viruses from other host species are introduced into the human population. Between such rare events, the evolution of influenza is shaped by antigenic drift: the accumulation of mutations that result in changes in exposed regions of the viral surface proteins. Antigenic drift makes the virus less susceptible to immediate neutralization by the immune system in individuals who have had a previous influenza infection or vaccination. A biannual reevaluation of the vaccine composition is essential to maintain its effectiveness due to this immune escape. The study of influenza genomes is key to this endeavor, increasing our understanding of antigenic drift and enhancing the accuracy of vaccine strain selection. Recent large-scale genome sequencing and antigenic typing has considerably improved our understanding of influenza evolution: epidemics around the globe are seeded from a reservoir in East-Southeast Asia with year-round prevalence of influenza viruses; antigenically similar strains predominate in epidemics worldwide for several years before being replaced by a new antigenic cluster of strains. Future in-depth studies of the influenza reservoir, along with large-scale data mining of genomic resources and the integration of epidemiological, genomic, and antigenic data, should enhance our understanding of antigenic drift and improve the detection and control of antigenically novel emerging strains.","bibo:AuthorList":["McHardy, Alice Carolyn","Adams, Ben"],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5842937,"sim:weight":0.228645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":135024,"sim:weight":0.172104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26480,"sim:weight":0.150088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.126338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We investigate the role of this type of human movement in the epidemiology of vector-borne pathogens such as dengue. Analysis is based on a metapopulation model where mobile humans connect static mosquito subpopulations. We find that, due to frequency dependent biting, infection incidence in the human and mosquito populations is almost independent of the duration of contact. If the mosquito population is not uniformly distributed between patches the transmission potential of the pathogen at the metapopulation level, as summarized by the basic reproductive number, is determined by the size of the largest subpopulation and reduced by stronger connectivity. Global extinction of the pathogen is less likely when increased human movement enhances the rescue effect but, in contrast to classical theory, it is not minimized at an intermediate level of connectivity. We conclude that hubs and reservoirs of infection can be places people visit frequently but briefly and the relative importance of human and mosquito populations in maintaining the pathogen depends on the distribution of the mosquito population and the variability in human travel patterns. These results offer an insight in to the paradoxical observation of resurgent urban vector-borne disease despite increased investment in vector control and suggest that successful public health intervention may require a dual approach. Prospective studies can be used to identify areas with large mosquito populations that are also visited by a large fraction of the human population. Retrospective studies can be used to map recent movements of infected people, pinpointing the mosquito subpopulation from which they acquired the infection and others to which they may have transmitted it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, Ben","Kapan, Durrell D."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2732115,"sim:weight":0.293195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85646,"sim:weight":0.207415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176851,"sim:weight":0.183532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.183024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.166504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Knocking down its function led to cells failing to form a mitotic spindle and arresting in mitosis. This caused nuclear breakdown, apoptosis and a striking loss of tissue architecture in the neural tube. Consistent with a role in spindle formation, RASSF7 protein was found to localise to the centrosome. This localisation occurred in a microtubule-dependent manner, demonstrating that there is a mutually dependant relationship between RASSF7 localisation and spindle formation. Thus RASSF7, the first member of the N-terminal RASSF family to be functionally analysed, is a centrosome-associated protein which is required to form a spindle and complete mitosis in the neural tube.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sherwood, Victoria","Manbodh, Ria","Sheppard, Carol","Chalmers, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9616710,"sim:weight":0.280786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108070,"sim:weight":0.148032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.146836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.143466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.126826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The absence of identifiable mutations in the majority of WTs suggests the frequent involvement of epigenetic aberrations in WT. We therefore conducted a genome-wide analysis of promoter hypermethylation in WTs and identified hypermethylation at chromosome 5q31 spanning 800 kilobases (kb) and more than 50 genes. The methylated genes all belong to alpha-, beta-, and gamma-protocadherin (PCDH) gene clusters (Human Genome Organization nomenclature PCDHA@, PCDHB@, and PCDHG@, respectively). This demonstrates that long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) occurs in developmental tumors as well as in adult tumors. Bisulfite polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that PCDH hypermethylation is a frequent event found in all Wilms\u0027 tumor subtypes. Hypermethylation is concordant with reduced PCDH expression in tumors. WT precursor lesions showed no PCDH hypermethylation, suggesting that de novo PCDH hypermethylation occurs during malignant progression. Discrete boundaries of the PCDH domain are delimited by abrupt changes in histone modifications; unmethylated genes flanking the LRES are associated with permissive marks which are absent from methylated genes within the domain. Silenced genes are marked with non-permissive histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation. Expression analysis of embryonic murine kidney and differentiating rat metanephric mesenchymal cells demonstrates that Pcdh expression is developmentally regulated and that Pcdhg@ genes are expressed in blastemal cells. Importantly, we show that PCDHs negatively regulate canonical Wnt signalling, as short-interfering RNA-induced reduction of PCDHG@ encoded proteins leads to elevated beta-catenin protein, increased beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) reporter activity, and induction of Wnt target genes. Conversely, over-expression of PCDHs suppresses beta-catenin/TCF-reporter activity and also inhibits colony formation and growth of cancer cells in soft agar. Thus PCDHs are candidate tumor suppressors that modulate regulatory pathways critical in development and disease, such as canonical Wnt signaling.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dallosso,  A. R.","Hancock,  A.

The nonlinear algorithm has been tested against some complicated experimental test cases and it\r\nhas been demonstrated that by using an improved forward model and nonlinear inversion method, very complex shaped samples can be reconstructed. The reconstruction of very complex geometry with objects in the shape of letters H, A, L and T, is extremely promising for the applications of 3D ECT.","bibo:AuthorList":["Banasiak, R","Wajman, R","Sankowski, D","Soleimani, Manuchehr"],"dc:date":"2010-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2801167,"sim:weight":0.623558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9611597,"sim:weight":0.379847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69883,"sim:weight":0.378747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827047,"sim:weight":0.351214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67787,"sim:weight":0.32652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5590228,"sim:weight":0.29795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5843034,"sim:weight":0.285225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31680,"sim:weight":0.283823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67782,"sim:weight":0.263565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50363,"sim:weight":0.256281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827048,"sim:weight":0.24667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67786,"sim:weight":0.238839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147453,"sim:weight":0.212234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22898,"sim:weight":0.184821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56544,"sim:weight":0.183052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In contrast, Taiwanese senior high school students have a greater tendency to choose science rather than social studies and achieve highly in international comparative tests. The well-developed technology industries in Taiwan also suggest that science education in Taiwan has been a success. However, the attitude toward school science, unlike the promotion of scientific attitudes, has received little attention in Taiwanese schools. \r\n\r\nThis paper firstly investigates 729 students’ attitudes toward both school and real-world science. The results show that the high level of uptake of science is not strongly associated with positive attitudes towards science as a subject. Few differences were found in the affective responses to school science between the Natural Sciences programme (NSP) and Social Studies Programme (SSP) students, with only a minority expressing a positive attitude to science in both cases. The research findings challenge the simplistic linking of attitudes and uptake in this context. \r\n\r\nThis research then seeks to understand this unusual phenomenon by exploring the nature of and influences on students’ subject choice decision-making. Through focus group discussions with students and interviews, this research explores the sources of students’ perceptions of science and social studies, identifying influences derived from the teaching of school science itself but also those arising from ‘external’ contexts of wider society, including cultural and economic influences.\r\n\r\nThe results show highly complex relationships between students and the surrounding actors, i.e. parents, teachers and the media. The findings also demonstrate possible explanations why students are doing well in school science and in industry but have not produced prominent discoveries or achievements in the world’s academic research. Drawing on Taiwan’s distinctive socio-cultural context, this research provides a different perspective from that in western science education research literature on the factors that shape science uptake.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hsu, Chiu-Yen"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In both respects the calculated sideband intensity behavior agrees with experimental findings (Appl. Phys. Lett. 75, 2728 (1999); Phys. Rev. B 70, 115312 (2004)]. The nonmonotonic THz-power dependence and saturation of the sideband intensity are due to the excitonic Stark splitting. While the sideband saturation imposes limitations on the wavelength conversion efficiency, the simultaneous broadening of sideband resonances benefits wavelength conversion by increasing the number of NIR frequencies available for wavelength conversion.

The form of IA used has been criticised for favouring corporate interests by overemphasising economic impacts and failing to adequately assess health impacts. Our study sought to assess how, why, and in what ways corporations, and particularly the tobacco industry, influenced the EU\u0027s approach to IA.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eMethods and Findings - In order to identify whether industry played a role in promoting this system of IA within the EU, we analysed internal documents from British American Tobacco (BAT) that were disclosed following a series of litigation cases in the United States. We combined this analysis with one of related literature and interviews with key informants. Our analysis demonstrates that from 1995 onwards BAT actively worked with other corporate actors to successfully promote a business-oriented form of IA that favoured large corporations. It appears that BAT favoured this form of IA because it could advance the company\u0027s European interests by establishing ground rules for policymaking that would: (i) provide an economic framework for evaluating all policy decisions, implicitly prioritising costs to businesses; (ii) secure early corporate involvement in policy discussions; (iii) bestow the corporate sector with a long-term advantage over other actors by increasing policymakers\u0027 dependence on information they supplied; and (iv) provide businesses with a persuasive means of challenging potential and existing legislation. The data reveal that an ensuing lobbying campaign, largely driven by BAT, helped secure binding changes to the EU Treaty via the Treaty of Amsterdam that required EU policymakers to minimise legislative burdens on businesses. Efforts subsequently focused on ensuring that these Treaty changes were translated into the application of a business orientated form of IA (cost–benefit analysis [CBA]) within EU policymaking procedures. Both the tobacco and chemical industries have since employed IA in apparent attempts to undermine key aspects of European policies designed to protect public health.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eConclusions - \r\nOur findings suggest that BAT and its corporate allies have fundamentally altered the way in which all EU policy is made by making a business-oriented form of IA mandatory. This increases the likelihood that the EU will produce policies that advance the interests of major corporations, including those that produce products damaging to health, rather than in the interests of its citizens. Given that the public health community, focusing on health IA, has largely welcomed the increasing policy interest in IA, this suggests that urgent consideration is required of the ways in which IA can be employed to undermine, as well as support, effective public health policies.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Katherine E","Fooks, Gary","Collin, Jeff","Weishaar, Heide","Mandal, Sema","Gilmore, Anna B"],"dc:date":"2010-01-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.220396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.18828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We have shown that exposure to manganese is a soil matrix causes a dramatic increase in prion protein survival (similar to 10 fold) over a two year period.

The objective of the current study was to determine whether twelve commonly-used physical activity recommendations similarly classified middle-aged men as sufficiently active for general health. Methods and Findings: We examined the commonality in the classification of physical activity status between twelve variations of physical activity recommendations for general health in ninety men aged 45-64 years. Physical activity was assessed using synchronised accelerometry and heart rate. Using different guidelines but the same raw data, the proportion of men defined as active ranged from to 11% to 98% for individual recommendations (median 73%, IQR 30% to 87%). There was very poor absolute agreement between the recommendations, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (A, 1) of 0.24 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.34). Only 8% of men met all 12 recommendations and would therefore be unanimously classified as active and only one man failed to meet every recommendation and would therefore be unanimously classified as not sufficiently active. The wide variability in physical activity classification was explained by ostensibly subtle differences between the 12 recommendations for thresholds related to activity volume (time or energy), distribution (e. g., number of days of the week), moderate intensity cut-point (e. g., 3 vs. 4 metabolic equivalents or METs), and duration (including bout length). Conclusions: Physical activity status varies enormously depending on the physical activity recommendation that is applied and even ostensibly small differences have a major impact. Approximately nine out of every ten men in the present study could be variably described as either active or not sufficiently active.

This article provides a rationale for both the development of robust quality of life measures specifically for children and also the use of these measures in assessing the effectiveness of treatments and policy changes.  It highlights recent advances in the development of quality of life measures, and provides examples of two instruments that have incorporated these steps to produce reliable and valid measures that are not only comprehensible to children of different age groups but also and meaningful to parents and health professionals.  The challenge of matching statistically significant change in quality of life to changes of perceived importance for the individual is also discussed in the light of the advantages to be gained from the increased uptake within health and social care of quality of life measures for children.\r\nSummary of policy and practice implications:\r\n•\tQuality of life measurement provides a broad perspective on the impact of health and social services for children, and is pivotal to a child-centred approach to service provision.\r\n•\tChildren’s quality of life measures can contribute meaningfully to the assessment of individual treatment, the outcome of clinical trials (or evaluation of services) and the impact of policies more broadly in health and social care for children.\r\n•\tWith built-in precautions and use of new methods, children as young as five are able to reliably report on their own quality of life, providing information about different areas of subjective well-being that are not immediately visible to proxy reporters, such as parents or practitioners.\r\n•\tAlthough not widely appreciated, robust measures of children’s quality of life are readily available for use in practice and research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skevington, Suzanne","Gillison, Fiona"],"dc:date":"2006-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study examined the impact of retirement on physical activity patterns. More specifically, the process of initiating and maintaining behaviour changes in physical activity were explored using a self-determination theory perspective (Deci \u0026 Ryan, 1991, 2000). Design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore the formation of lifestyle habits post-retirement, and the role of physical activity within these. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis and an informal comparison made between physically active and inactive retired adults. Methods. Eleven participants (7 female, 4 male; 6 physically active, 5 physically inactive) were recruited from churches and a local newspaper advertisement in South West England. On average, participants (M age \u003d 62.91 years; SD\u003d2.3) had been retired 2 years and 8 months (SD\u003d 20.03). Results. Three main themes emerged from the interviews specific to retired adults; social factors, lifelong tendencies, and sense of purpose. All retired adults searched for purpose in their lives, and for physically active adults having an exercise schedule contributed to this on a daily basis. Physical activity also represented a source of personal challenge, whereas physically inactive retirees sought meaning and challenge from non-exercise domains. All participants were acutely aware of their mortality, but active participants felt that physical activity would increase their chances of enjoying a healthy retirement, rather than accepting a decline in physical function. Conclusions. The results highlighted how global aspirations for life after retirement can influence one’s post-retirement lifestyle. The implications for future research and potential health promotion approaches are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Beck, Fay","Gillison, Fiona","Standage, Martyn"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931341,"sim:weight":0.228893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931342,"sim:weight":0.228893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.171298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.166425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316083,"sim:weight":0.154652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.143178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316484,"sim:weight":0.12646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Ninety-five anthropometric measurements were obtained directly from five athletic performers and indirectly from digitization of subject-specific whole-body still images. The direct and image-based measurements were used as input into Yeadon’s (1990) inertia model. The overall absolute error in predicted whole-body mass achieved using the image-based approach (2.87%) compared well to that achieved using the direct measurements (2.10%). The inclusion of image-based anthropometric measurements obtained from extremity (hand and feet) images was not found to consistently improve model accuracy achieved using whole-body images only. The presented method provides a successful alternative to direct measurement for obtaining anthropometric measurements required for customized inertia modeling. The noninvasive image-based approach is benefited by the potential for obtaining subject-specific measurements from large samples of subjects and elite athletic performers for whom time-consuming data collections may be undesirable.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gittoes, M.J.R.","Bezodis, I.N.","Wilson, C."],"dc:date":"2009-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A percentage difference of 6.6% between simulation and recorded performance was obtained. Maximizing the height reached by the mass center during the flight phase by varying torque generator activation timings resulted in a credible height increase of 90 mm compared with the matching simulation. These two results imply that the model is sufficiently complex and has appropriate strength parameters to give realistic simulations of running jumps for height.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, Cassie","King, M.A.","Yeadon, M.R."],"dc:date":"2006-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of these complaints in a UK community setting and to establish whether psychosocial risk factors, or ‘yellow flags’, moderate their impact on daily life and work. METHODS: 580 women and 420 men participated in a cross-sectional survey in the UK in 2007. 467 (57.2%) of the 816 working age adults in this sample reported complaints over the last month and were included in the moderator multivariate analysis. Results Women and the not employed group reported a higher number and greater extent (frequency × severity) of complaints. Statistically significant models emerged for interference with daily life (F 9,457 \u003d 36.54, P \u003c 0.001, adjusted R 2 \u003d 0.407) and time off work (F 4,462 \u003d 31.22, P \u003c 0.001, adjusted R 2 \u003d 0.213). Age (β \u003d .238) and socio-economic status (β \u003d −.216) were associated with time off work. Extent of complaints and number of yellow flags were independently associated with interference with daily life (extent β \u003d .25, yellow flags β \u003d .15) and time off work (extent β \u003d .154, yellow flags β \u003d .201). No moderating effect of yellow flags was found. CONCLUSIONS: Common health problems and yellow flags can be briefly and simply assessed. A broader approach is needed in managing these complaints in community and work contexts, moving beyond reducing complaint severity. Interventions need to acknowledge and address people’s beliefs and affective responses to complaints, as well as wider socio-economic issues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buck, Rhiannon","Barnes, M C","Cohen, D","Aylward, M"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":56397,"sim:weight":0.228309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.222886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.190616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448025,"sim:weight":0.163956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.142616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56591,"sim:weight":0.134277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27139,"sim:weight":0.130635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.118932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study revealed a situation where early adoption is moving to mainstream takeup and where there is continuing tension between users and central management and/or IT support. Web 2.0 services are used to varying degrees, with a reliance on market leaders.

It is found from theoretical modeling with a computer simulation that the electron beam emits electromagnetic radiation which is characterized by consecutive broadband pulses in the low-frequency radio range from similar to 10 to 300 kHz at a distance of similar to 800 km. Experimental evidence for the existence of consecutive broadband pulses is provided by low-frequency radio observations of sprite-producing lightning discharges at a distance of similar to 550 km. The measured broadband pulses occur similar to 4-9 ms after the sprite-producing lightning discharge, they exhibit electromagnetic radiation which mainly spans the frequency range from similar to 50 to 350 kHz, and they exhibit complex waveforms without the typical ionospheric reflection of the first hop sky wave. Two consecutive pulses occur similar to 4.5 ms and similar to 3 ms after the causative lightning discharge and coincide with the sprite luminosity. It is concluded that relativistic runaway breakdown within the Earth\u0027s atmosphere can emit broadband electromagnetic pulses and possibly generates sprites. The source location of the broadband pulses can be determined with an interferometric network of wideband low-frequency radio receivers to lend further experimental support to the relativistic runaway breakdown theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fullekrug, M","Roussel-Dupre, R","Symbalisty, E M D","Chanrion, O","Odzimek, A","van der Velde, O","Neubert, T"],"dc:date":"2010-01-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":710796,"sim:weight":0.346648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711340,"sim:weight":0.262419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710340,"sim:weight":0.249056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":712183,"sim:weight":0.246177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2811012,"sim:weight":0.245183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710670,"sim:weight":0.241872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84102,"sim:weight":0.232406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711190,"sim:weight":0.228818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711622,"sim:weight":0.227384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711397,"sim:weight":0.215844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711739,"sim:weight":0.21154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711168,"sim:weight":0.210186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710912,"sim:weight":0.169348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68027,"sim:weight":0.168716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":712062,"sim:weight":0.164001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711110,"sim:weight":0.160171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001143,"sim:weight":0.152116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708575,"sim:weight":0.149264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69159,"sim:weight":0.148924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71069,"sim:weight":0.135128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here the many-particle evolution is analyzed for a hard sphere flow with the addition that after a collision the collided particles are removed from the system. We consider random initial configurations which are drawn from a Poisson point process with spatially homogeneous velocity density f (0)(v). Assuming that the moments of order less than three of f (0) are finite and no mass is concentrated on lines, the homogeneous Boltzmann equation without gain term is derived for arbitrary long times in the Boltzmann-Grad scaling. A key element is a characterization of the many-particle flow by a hierarchy of trees which encode the possible collisions. The occurring trees are shown to have favorable properties with a high probability, allowing us to restrict the analysis to a finite number of interacting particles and enabling us to extract a single-body distribution. A counter-example is given for a concentrated initial density f (0) even to short-term validity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Matthies,  K.","Theil,  F."],"dc:date":"2010-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":269863,"sim:weight":0.329949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85525,"sim:weight":0.296365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176882,"sim:weight":0.191779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176870,"sim:weight":0.180427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A photonic microcell consists of a length of hollow-core photonic crystal fibre (HC-PCF) with a gas-filled core that is spliced to conventional optical fibre at either end to seal the gas within the fibre. Towards the goal of demonstrating and assessing the coherence properties of quantum optical effects in photonic microcells, the fabrication of two types of HC-PCF is presented. The established photonic bandgap HC-PCF offers extremely low transmission loss of ~10 dB/km over kilometre distances. However, the fibre has a limited transmission bandwidth of ~50 THz and exhibits modal coupling unfavourable for many applications. Work is presented on the tailoring of this fibre by control and shaping of the core-surround in order to improve its modal properties. A second type of HC-PCF is based on a large-pitch lattice, whose guidance relies on a new mechanism. This fibre exhibits a much improved bandwidth (\u003e1000 THz) and has a relatively higher but still practical loss of ~1 dB/m. The development of photonic microcells at microbar pressure level and with low optical insertion loss is shown, an important step in the improvement of the technology for coherent optics applications which will take advantage of the extreme gas-laser interaction efficiency achieved in HC-PCF. Finally, quantum optical effects are demonstrated in HC-PCF and photonic microcells loaded with both the molecular gas acetylene and atomic vapour rubidium. The observation of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in acetylene-filled HC-PCF represents the first such observation in a molecular gas, while the use of a photonic microcell allows a comparison of many experimental configurations to explore the coherence properties of coherent optical systems in the core of a HC-PCF. Furthermore, EIT is observed unambiguously in a rubidium loaded HC-PCF for the first time, and the anti-relaxation effects of a polymer coating demonstrated in this configuration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Light, Philip Stephen"],"dc:date":"2008-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2812437,"sim:weight":0.679691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584826,"sim:weight":0.600363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26191,"sim:weight":0.356735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109196,"sim:weight":0.286621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28584,"sim:weight":0.211504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22850,"sim:weight":0.189172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54114,"sim:weight":0.187569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23394,"sim:weight":0.18089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22843,"sim:weight":0.156148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108056,"sim:weight":0.151177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26192,"sim:weight":0.140133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268391,"sim:weight":0.139775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268952,"sim:weight":0.135248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84927,"sim:weight":0.134466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108578,"sim:weight":0.125141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.113358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22901,"sim:weight":0.108624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Firstly, we consider the model of directed polymers in random environment.\r\nIn this case, a polymer, represented as the path of a simple random walk on a\r\nlattice, interacts with an environment given by a collection of time-dependent random\r\nvariables associated to the vertices. Under certain conditions, the system undergoes a\r\nphase transition from an entropy-dominated regime at high temperatures, to a localised\r\nregime at low temperatures. Our main result shows that at high temperatures, even\r\nthough a central limit theorem holds, we can identify a set of paths constituting a vanishing\r\nfraction of all paths that supports the free energy. We compare the situation to\r\na mean-field model defined on a regular tree, where we can also describe the situation\r\nat the critical temperature.\r\nSecondly, we consider the parabolic Anderson model, which is the Cauchy problem\r\nfor the heat equation with a random potential. Our setting is continuous in time\r\nand discrete in space, and we focus on time-constant, independent and identically\r\ndistributed potentials with polynomial tails at infinity. We are concerned with the\r\nlong-term temporal dynamics of this system. Our main result is that the periods, in\r\nwhich the profile of the solutions remains nearly constant, are increasing linearly over\r\ntime, a phenomenon known as ageing. We describe this phenomenon in the weak sense,\r\nby looking at the asymptotic probability of a change in a given time window, and in\r\nthe strong sense, by identifying the almost sure upper envelope for the process of the\r\ntime remaining until the next change of profile. We also prove functional scaling limit\r\ntheorems for profile and growth rate of the solution of the parabolic Anderson model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ortgiese, Marcel"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8929425,"sim:weight":0.313259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929442,"sim:weight":0.284365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85525,"sim:weight":0.274671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931792,"sim:weight":0.255845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.238814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.233592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.224138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2811761,"sim:weight":0.175655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Eight key concerns regarding IA are identified from the literature, many of which relate to the potential for undue corporate influence. Assessment of the EU\u0027s IA tool suggests that many of these concerns are valid. The findings raise crucial questions about the role of IA in public policy. By focusing mainly on the impact on the economy and business environment, the EU\u0027s current approach to IA may undermine healthy public policy.

It was a qualitative, longitudinal study which initially followed a grounded theory approach. However, as a theatrical metaphor became apparent from the data the approach changed to dramaturgical analysis. Face to face semi-structured interviews were conducted with fifteen carers before and after the death of their family member. Carers were found to be performing a leading role in home palliative care but they experienced a universal sense of uncertainty and of being unrehearsed for their role in the dying process. They were reluctant to seek information to give them a script for their performance because it was painful and difficult to contemplate their family member dying. They needed the direction of health professionals and the support of paid carers but had variable experiences of these services. Carers’ performance types were also variable but tended to be towards the combative or the pragmatic end of a continuum. Their experience was illuminated through the dramaturgical metaphor of a play called the Carer’s Initiation. The climax of the play was the death of the family member followed by the finale in which they watch over the body until it is removed and they finally face a future without their family member. The carer’s initiation highlighted policy and practice implications for improving the preparation and support of carers for the dying process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Newbury, Margaret J"],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.403177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.34734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68602,"sim:weight":0.33583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929976,"sim:weight":0.334232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316088,"sim:weight":0.324456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.295132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.287434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70031,"sim:weight":0.283636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53865,"sim:weight":0.279681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653231,"sim:weight":0.259691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.250141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.238937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.23877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":294473,"sim:weight":0.231329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54968,"sim:weight":0.230482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795330,"sim:weight":0.228967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.220666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.207944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176829,"sim:weight":0.157123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To ascribe the resulting genotype-to-phenotype relationship unambiguously to the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, we challenged the allele combinations by genetically restricting intracellular beta-catenin expression in the corresponding compound mutant mice. Subsequent evaluation of the extent of resulting Tcf4-reporter activity in mouse embryo fibroblasts enabled genetic measurement of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the form of an allelic series of mouse mutants. Different permissive Wnt signaling thresholds appear to be required for the embryonic development of head structures, adult intestinal polyposis, hepatocellular carcinomas, liver zonation, and the development of natural killer cells. Furthermore, we identify a homozygous Apc allele combination with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling capacity similar to that in the germline of the Apc(min) mice, where somatic Apc loss-of-heterozygosity triggers intestinal polyposis, to distinguish whether co-morbidities in Apc(min) mice arise independently of intestinal tumorigenesis.

In contrast, molecular chaperones have long been recognized to play crucial roles in misfolding prevention and remedy. We propose that putative error limitation in cis can be elucidated by examining the interaction between codon usage and chaperoning processes. Using Escherichia coli as a model system, we find that codon optimality covaries with dependency on the chaperonin GroEL. Sporadic but not obligate substrates of GroEL exhibit higher average codon adaptation and are conspicuously enriched for optimal codons at structurally sensitive sites. Further, codon optimality of sporadic clients is more conserved in the E. coli clone Shigella dysenteriae. We suggest that highly expressed genes cannot routinely use GroEL for error control so that codon usage has evolved to provide complementary error limitation. These findings provide independent evidence for a role of misfolding in shaping gene evolution and highlight the need to co-characterize adaptations in cis and trans to unravel the workings of integrated molecular systems.

The Cu\r\nand Zn isotope ratios for four strains of wild-type mice showed no significant difference (δ65Cu -\r\n0.12 to -0.78 permil; δ66Zn -0.23 to -0.48 permil). We also looked at how altering the expression\r\nof a single copper binding protein, the prion protein (PrP), alters the isotope ratios. Both knockout\r\nand overexpression of PrP had no significant effect on the ratio of Cu isotopes. Mice brains\r\nexpressing mutant PrP lacking the known metal binding domain have δ65Cu isotope values of on\r\naverage 0.57 permil higher than wild-type mouse brains.

Studies typically concentrate on the role of non-coding RNAs in\r\nregulating coding RNA. But the majority of transcripts in a cell are likely to be coding. Is it possible\r\nthat coding RNA might regulate other coding RNA by short perfect sense-antisense binding? Here\r\nwe compare all well-described human protein coding mRNAs against all others to identify sites 15-\r\n25 bp long that could potentially perfectly match sense-antisense.\r\nResults: From 24,968 protein coding mRNA RefSeq sequences, none failed to find at least one\r\nmatch in the transcriptome. By randomizations generating artificial transcripts matched for G+C\r\ncontent and length, we found that there are more such trans short sense-antisense pairs than\r\nexpected. Several further features are consistent with functionality of some of the putative\r\nmatches. First, transcripts with more potential partners have lower expression levels, and the pair\r\ndensity of tissue specific genes is significantly higher than that of housekeeping genes. Further, the\r\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism density is lower in short pairing regions than it is in flanking regions.\r\nWe found no evidence that the sense-antisense pairing regions are associated with small RNAs\r\nderived from the protein coding genes.\r\nConclusions: Our results are consistent with the possibility of common short perfect senseantisense\r\npairing between transcripts of protein coding genes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Ping","Yin, Shanye","Zhang, Zhenguo","Xin, Dedong","Hu, Landian","Kong, Xiangyin","Hurst, Laurence"],"dc:date":"2008-12-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24013,"sim:weight":0.24226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1577103,"sim:weight":0.181772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.137624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1577100,"sim:weight":0.13089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.126422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.109918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25913,"sim:weight":0.101206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The interactions between Photorhabdus and its hosts are\r\nthought to be an obligate part of the bacteria\u0027s life-cycle in the environment. Motility often plays a\r\nkey role in mediating bacteria-host interactions and, in this study, we were interested in\r\ncharacterising the role of motility in the Photorhabdus-nematode-insect tripartite association.\r\nResults: We constructed deletion mutants of flgG (blocking flagella production) and motAB\r\n(blocking flagella rotation) in P. luminescens TT01. Using these mutants we show that both the ΔflgG\r\nand ΔmotAB mutants are equally as good as the wild-type (WT) bacteria in killing insects and\r\nsupporting nematode growth and development suggesting that flagella production and motility are\r\nnot required for pathogenicity or mutualism. However we show that the production of flagella is\r\nassociated with a significant metabolic cost during growth on agar plates suggesting that, although\r\nnot required for pathogenicity or mutualism, there must be a strong selective pressure to retain\r\nflagella production (and motility) during the interactions between Photorhabdus and its different\r\nhosts. To this end we show that both the ΔflgG and ΔmotAB mutants are out-competed by WT\r\nPhotorhabdus during prolonged incubation in the insect revealing that motile bacteria do have a\r\nfitness advantage during colonisation of the insect larva.\r\nConclusion: This is the first report of a role for motility in Photorhabdus and we show that,\r\nalthough not required for either pathogenicity or mutualism, motility does contribute to the\r\ncompetitive fitness of Photorhabdus during infection of the insect (and, to a lesser extent, the\r\nnematode). This adaptive function is similar to the role ascribed to motility in mammalian\r\npathogens such as uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Therefore, in addition to describing a role\r\nfor motility in Photorhabdus, this study reinforces the relevance and utility of this bacterium as a\r\nmodel for studying bacteria-host interactions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Easom, Catherine A.","Clarke, David J"],"dc:date":"2008-10-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2805657,"sim:weight":0.464746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2807261,"sim:weight":0.417177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24401,"sim:weight":0.128303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This difference may lead to sexual conflict between parents over care\r\nprovisioning in animals that breed with multiple mates. One of the most obvious manifestations of\r\nsexual conflict over care is offspring desertion whereby one parent deserts the young to increase\r\nits reproductive success at the expense of its mate. Offspring desertion is a wide-spread behavior,\r\nand its frequency often varies within populations. We studied the consistency of offspring desertion\r\nin a small passerine bird, the Eurasian penduline tit Remiz pendulinus, that has an extremely variable\r\nbreeding system. Both males and females are sequentially polygamous, and a single parent (either\r\nthe male or the female) incubates the eggs and rears the young. About 28–40% of offspring are\r\nabandoned by both parents, and these offspring perish. Here we investigate whether the variation\r\nin offspring desertion in a population emerges either by each individual behaving consistently\r\nbetween different broods, or it is driven by the environment.\r\nResults: Using a three-year dataset from Southern Hungary we show that offspring desertion by\r\nfemales is consistent between nests. Male desertion, however, depends on ambient environment,\r\nbecause all males desert their nests early in the season and some of them care late in the season.\r\nTherefore, within-population variation in parental care emerges by sexually different mechanisms;\r\nbetween-individual variation was responsible for the observed pattern of offspring desertion in\r\nfemales, whereas within-individual variation was responsible for the observed pattern in males.\r\nConclusion: To our knowledge, our study is the first that investigates repeatability of offspring\r\ndesertion behavior in nature. The contrasting strategies of the sexes imply complex evolutionary\r\ntrajectories in breeding behavior of penduline tits. Our results raise an intriguing question whether\r\nthe sexual difference in caring/deserting decisions explain the extreme intensity of sexual conflict\r\nin penduline tits that produces a high frequency of biparentally deserted (and thus wasted)\r\noffspring.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pogány, Ákos","Szentirmai, István","Komdeur, Jan","Székely, Tamás"],"dc:date":"2008-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2806257,"sim:weight":0.462298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2813802,"sim:weight":0.458662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2806052,"sim:weight":0.397227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9611582,"sim:weight":0.299571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385077,"sim:weight":0.203035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108971,"sim:weight":0.182379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.171261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108684,"sim:weight":0.168646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This poster takes an analytical perspective on some engineering methods that bridge these, ostensibly quite dissimilar, data structures. It will be the result of this investigation, to attempt to link knowledge management, cataloging structures, and user perceptions of data models, seeing these as both related and complementary in nature.\r\nFirst, we examine the role of evidence from user-centred studies; for example, card sorting. These demonstrate individual user perceptions in a given area and how these perceptions tailor the collection of input data. Evidence from collaborative studies may also be evaluated regarding development of the underlining data structures. These can be applied to many evidence areas; such as, evaluation of fit between user perception of a task or topic area and the interpretation offered by an automated system.\r\nSecondly, we examine evidence from the analysis of the data sets themselves, guided in part by initial user input; this may be used as supporting evidence for evaluation purposes. This type of analysis can provide evidence of how, collaboratively, users\u0027 starting perceptions are shaped by past experiences, others\u0027 experiences and suggestions by automated systems.\r\nLastly, we consider the evidence in the evaluation of linkages of the data sets from an ontology and the development of the data structures of a conceptual module, feeding into a more theoretical although evidence-led discussion of the relation between language, structure and evidence grounded within grounded data and user perceptions. All of these approaches together can be used as sources of information for eventual development of functional application elements, including ontological and meta-data structures, and data structures in a more general sense.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pfeiffer, H.

The British industrial sector accounts for around one\r\nfifth of final energy demand and one third of carbon emissions nationally. This thesis attempts\r\nto quantify the potential for industrial energy efficiency from the current baseline, by adopting\r\nthermodynamic and economic perspectives.\r\nThe methodology involves a top-down analysis of energy trends within the manufacturing\r\nsector to determine the baseline against which changes are measured, leading to bottom-up case\r\nstudies which explicitly consider the detailed mechanisms affecting energy demand. Top-down\r\nanalysis highlights the diversity between industrial sectors, for which a sectoral classification\r\nbased on process homogeneity is proposed. It also enables the long term, systemic potential for\r\nefficiency improvements to be estimated and identifies the barriers to uptake.\r\nBottom-up case studies are better suited to identifying the sectoral potential in the short to\r\nmedium term.

Some are general, such as anxiety, depression and negative affectivity, whereas others are more specifically pain-related (eg, fear of pain, pain anxiety, and pain catastrophizing). In addition, some more specific fear-related constructs, such as anxiety sensitivity, illness/injury sensitivity, and fear of negative evaluation have emerged as important to pain. Although these various constructs are considered conceptually separate, there is likely to be overlap between them. Since the extent of this overlap is unknown, the aim of the current study was to investigate these constructs in 1 sample in order to identify their common and unique features. Frequently used psychological measures were completed by 508 pain-free participants. Principal components analysis resulted in the extraction of three components: 1) General distress; 2) Fear of pain from injury/insult; and 3) Cognitive intrusion of pain. The results presented here suggest that there is indeed commonality between constructs, which may be due to either an overlap between items within measures or to close conceptual relatedness. The implications of these core dimensions are discussed with reference to future research and theory. Perspective: This article explores the relationships between various negative-affect pain-related measures and discusses the results from a principal components analysis. The findings show that some questionnaires may measure the same latent construct.

A trade-off between the cost and benefit of care is expected, so that when care provisioning by both parents is essential for the success of young, for instance in extremely cold or hot environments, the parents should rear their young together. We investigated the latter hypothesis in a ground nesting shorebird, the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus in an extremely hot environment, the Arabian Desert. Midday ground temperature was often above 50 C in our study site in Abu Dhabi ( United Arab Emirates), thus leaving the eggs unattended even for a few minute risks overheating and death of embryos. Results: Through the use of video surveillance systems we recorded incubation routines of male and female Kentish plovers at 28 nests over a full day ( 24 h). We show that ambient temperature had a significant influence on incubation behaviour of both sexes, and the relationships are often non-linear. Coordinated incubation between parents was particularly strong in midday with incubation shared approximately equally between the male and the female. The enhanced biparental incubation was due to males increasing their nest attendance with ambient temperature. Conclusions: Our results suggest biparental care is essential during incubation in the Kentish plover in extremely hot environments. Shared incubation may also help the parents to cope with heat stress themselves: they can relieve each other frequently from incubation duties. We suggest that once the eggs have hatched the risks associated with hot temperature are reduced: the chicks become mobile, and they gradually develop thermoregulation. When biparental care of young is no longer essential one parent may desert the family. The relaxed demand of the offspring may contribute to the diverse breeding systems exhibited by many shorebirds.","bibo:AuthorList":["AlRashidi,  M.","Kosztolanyi,  A.","Kupper,  C.","Cuthill,  I.

These two cell types differ in their developmental fate. In the neural ectoderm, primary neurons are derived only from the deep cells. In the epidermal ectoderm, superficial cells express high levels of differentiation markers, while most of the deep cells do not differentiate until later when they produce the stratified adult epidermis. However, few molecular differences are known between the deep and superficial cells. Here, we have undertaken a systematic approach to identify genes that show layer-restricted expression by microarray analysis of deep and superficial cells at the gastrula stage, followed by wholemount in situ hybridisation. We have identified 32 differentially expressed genes, of which 26 show higher expression in the superficial layer and 6 in the deep layer and describe their expression at the gastrula and neurula stage. One of the identified genes is the transcription factor Grhl3, which we found to be expressed in the superficial layer of the gastrula ectoderm and the neurula epidermis. By using markers identified in this work, we show that Grlh3 promotes superficial gene expression in the deep layer of the epidermis. Concomitantly, deep layer specific genes are switched off, showing that Grlh3 can promote deep cells to take on a superficial cell identity in the embryonic epidermis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chalmers, Andrew","Lachani, Kim","Shin, Yongchol","Sherwood, Victoria","Cho, Ken","Papalopulu, Nancy"],"dc:date":"2006-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.195762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There is a widespread view that knowledge is important to organizations and this has led to the study of knowledge management. There are a plethora of definitions of knowledge and knowledge management, but knowledge sharing is recognised as being of fundamental importance. The literature shows the success of knowledge sharing is not only affected by factors including culture, management, technology, processes and structure but, more importantly, it is affected by how these factors interact and fit together. However there is little literature on alignment or strategic fit in knowledge sharing. This research adds to the literature by investigating the enablers and constraints of knowledge sharing and the possible effects of alignment. An interpretive approach using case studies triangulated with a survey is adopted, involving semi-structured interviews with 23 people across five organizations. The findings suggest that significant top management support and a strategy for knowledge sharing are necessary precursors of effective knowledge sharing. In the organizations which lacked this, there is little to encourage people to share and almost none of these organizations measured well on any aspect of knowledge sharing. There are widely varying uses of technology, but many are aimed at sharing data or information. Fewer uses of technology are geared to enabling or encouraging the communication necessary for knowledge sharing. The lack of senior management support may prevent any significant internal or external alignment so a possible approach to strategic fit for knowledge sharing is that strategy has to come first (and the management support that goes with it) and that this should lead to the embedding of the necessary behaviours for knowledge sharing. Only after this are processes and technology able to support knowledge sharing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Goodwin, S"],"dc:date":"2009-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Results: Isometric knee extension force decreased immediately after load carriage with no difference between conditions. During recovery, isometric force returned to pre-exercise values at 48 h for CHO and PRO but at 72 h for PLA.

In the center of mass approximation, these motion-induced changes are ascribed to mixing between the 1S exciton ground state and the higher lying nP states. The origin of the mixing is due to the dispersion curves for the valence band not being of simple parabolic form. Detailed previous studies of excitons in CdTe have resulted in excellent agreement between experiment and the predictions of this model. One consequence of the mixing is that the magnetic moment of the exciton is not simply the sum of the magnetic moments of the electron and hole, but contains motion-induced contributions, which can easily dominate the contributions from the individual charge carriers. To confirm the validity of the model, we have carried out detailed investigations of the magnetic properties of center of mass excitons in a second semiconductor, ZnSe, for which the magneto-optical properties of the individual charge carriers are completely different from those of CdTe. Excellent agreement is obtained between theory and experiment with a choice of the Luttinger parameter gamma(3)\u003d0.98, in close agreement with the value determined independently by two-photon magnetoabsorption experiments. The success of the model when applied to both materials provides strong evidence that motion-induced changes in magnetism are a universal feature in zinc-blende semiconductors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, J J","Smith, L C","Wolverson, D","Gust, A","Kruse, C","Hommel, D","Kochereshko, V P"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2810434,"sim:weight":0.491446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23890,"sim:weight":0.288893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108107,"sim:weight":0.282523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108364,"sim:weight":0.270437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108299,"sim:weight":0.267623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108676,"sim:weight":0.258747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108874,"sim:weight":0.254561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176856,"sim:weight":0.249052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108727,"sim:weight":0.239747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.237811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26650,"sim:weight":0.234334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269537,"sim:weight":0.230504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.219655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108775,"sim:weight":0.21651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85213,"sim:weight":0.16534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, while gene-targeting techniques have allowed for the identification of imprinted loci, very little is known about the contribution of imprinting to quantitative variation in complex traits. Most studies, furthermore, assume a simple pattern of imprinting, resulting in either paternal or maternal gene expression; yet, more complex patterns of effects also exist. As a result, the distribution and number of different imprinting patterns across the genome remain largely unexplored. We address these unresolved issues using a genome-wide scan for imprinted quantitative trait loci (iQTL) affecting body weight and growth in mice using a novel three-generation design. We identified ten iQTL that display much more complex and diverse effect patterns than previously assumed, including four loci with effects similar to the callipyge mutation found in sheep. Three loci display a new phenotypic pattern that we refer to as bipolar dominance, where the two heterozygotes are different from each other while the two homozygotes are identical to each other. Our study furthermore detected a paternally expressed iQTL on Chromosome 7 in a region containing a known imprinting cluster with many paternally expressed genes. Surprisingly, the effects of the iQTL were mostly restricted to traits expressed after weaning. Our results imply that the quantitative effects of an imprinted allele at a locus depend both on its parent of origin and the allele it is paired with. Our findings also show that the imprinting pattern of a locus can be variable over ontogenetic time and, in contrast to current views, may often be stronger at later stages in life.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wolf, Jason B.","Cheverud, James M.","Roseman, Charles","Hager, Reinmar","Ferguson-Smith, Anne C."],"dc:date":"2008-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2805561,"sim:weight":0.537971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2805576,"sim:weight":0.533111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85444,"sim:weight":0.189587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.140355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86227,"sim:weight":0.133821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.124682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23818,"sim:weight":0.0961074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There are several competing theories attempting to explain the evolutionary origin of this monoallelic pattern of gene expression, but a prevailing view has emerged that holds that genomic imprinting is a consequence of conflict between maternal and paternal gene copies over maternal investment. However, many imprinting patterns and the apparent overabundance of maternally expressed genes remain unexplained and may be incompatible with current theory. Here we demonstrate that sole expression of maternal gene copies is favored by natural selection because it increases the adaptive integration of offspring and maternal genomes, leading to higher offspring fitness. This novel coadaptation theory for the evolution of genomic imprinting is consistent with results of recent studies on epigenetic effects, and it provides a testable hypothesis for the origin of previously unexplained major imprinting patterns across different taxa.

Administration of hesperetin for 18h did not alter gene expression driven by the cyclic AMP response element (CRE), assessed using a luciferase reporter system, but 300nM hesperetin partially reversed staurosporine-induced cell death in primary neurones. Our data show that hesperetin is a neuroprotective compound at concentrations where antioxidant effects are unlikely to predominate.

We discovered a groove running anterior and parallel to the incurrent nostril. This groove, dubbed the minor nasal groove to distinguish it from the larger, previously described, (major) nasal groove, is common to all eight hammerhead species. Using life-sized plasticmodels generated at 200 μm resolution from an X-ray scan, we also investigated flow in the nasal region. Even modest oncoming flow speeds stimulate extensive, but not complete, circulation within the model olfactory chamber, with flow passing through the two main olfactory channels. Flow crossed from one channel to another via a gap in the olfactory array, sometimes guided by the interlamellar channels. Major and minor nasal grooves, as well as directing flow into the olfactory chamber, can, in conjunction with the nasal bridge separating incurrent and excurrent nostrils, limit flow passing into the olfactory chamber, possibly to protect the delicate nasal structures.

An essential part of this symbiosis is the ability of the bacterium to colonize the gut of the freeliving form of the nematode called the infective juvenile (IJ). Although the colonization process (also called transmission) has been described phenomonologically very little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Therefore, in this study, we were interested in identifying genes in Photorhabdus that are important for IJ colonization. Results: In this work we genetically tagged P. luminescens TT01 with gfp and constructed a library containing over 3200 mutants using the suicide vector, pUT-Km2. Using a combination of in vitro symbiosis assays and fluorescent microscopy we screened this library for mutants that were affected in their ability to colonize the IJ i.e. with decreased transmission frequencies. In total 8 mutants were identified with transmission frequencies of \u003c\u003d 30% compared to wild-type. These mutants were mapped to 6 different genetic loci; the pbgPE operon, galE, galU, proQ, asmA and hdfR. The pbgPE, galE and galU mutants were all predicted to be involved in LPS biosynthesis and, in support of this, we have shown that these mutants are avirulent and sensitive to the cationic antimicriobial peptide, polymyxin B. On the other hand the proQ, asmA and hdfR mutants were not affected in virulence and were either as resistant (proQ) or slightly more sensitive (asmA, hdfR) to polymyxin B than the wild-type (WT). Conclusions: This is the first report describing the outcome of a comprehensive screen looking for transmission mutants in Photorhabdus. In total 6 genetic loci were identified and we present evidence that all of these loci are involved in the assembly and/or maintenance of LPS and other factors associated with the cell surface. Interestingly several, but not all, of the transmission mutants identified were also avirulent suggesting that there is a significant, but not complete, genetic overlap between pathogenicity and mutualism. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of the cell surface in mediating the symbiotic and pathogenic interactions of Photorhabdus.","bibo:AuthorList":["Easom,  C. A.","Joyce,  S.

Here, we report that in passerine birds, migratory species tend to have brains that are substantially smaller (relative to body size) than those of resident species, confirming and generalizing previous studies. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on Bayesian Markov chain methods suggest an evolutionary scenario in which some large brained tropical passerines that invaded more seasonal regions evolved migratory behavior and migration itself selected for smaller brain size. Selection for smaller brains in migratory birds may arise from the energetic and developmental costs associated with a highly mobile life cycle, a possibility that is supported by a path analysis. Nevertheless, an important fraction (over 68%) of the correlation between brain mass and migratory distance comes from a direct effect of migration on brain size, perhaps reflecting costs associated with cognitive functions that have become less necessary in migratory species. Overall, our results highlight the importance of retrospective analyses in identifying selective pressures that have shaped brain evolution, and indicate that when it comes to the brain, larger is not always better.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sol,  D.","Garcia,  N.","Iwaniuk,  A.","Davis,  K.","Meade,  A.","Boyle,  W.

This alteration means that we are taking into account the order in which observations are made. This new notion of graph gives rise to a model of affine lambda-calculus that admits an interpretation of imperative constructs including variable assignment, dereferencing and allocation. Extending this untyped model, we construct a category that provides a model of typed higher-order imperative computation with an affine type system. An appropriate language of this kind is Reynolds\u0027s Syntactic Control of Interference. Our model turns out to be fully abstract for this language. At a concrete level, it is the same as Reddy\u0027s object spaces model, which was the first \"state-free\" model of a higher-order imperative programming language and an important precursor of games models.

Food-colouring dye flow visualization, Laser-induced\r\nfluorescent flow visualization, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and force\r\nmeasurements were conducted in the water and wind tunnels over a range of\r\ndimensionless frequencies and jet momentum coefficients.

The existing child poverty literature is dominated by studies from economics\r\nand developmental psychology, which for the most part overlook not only the perspectives of\r\nchildren in poverty but also their use of coping strategies and experiences of resilience. Much can\r\nbe inferred, however, from studies of the lives of children in developing countries in terms of the\r\nactive role poor children play in their lives and their families’ lives. Additionally, a small but\r\ngrowing number of qualitative child poverty studies in Europe and North America (e.g. Ridge,\r\n2002) have highlighted the resourcefulness and optimism of many children living in poverty. They\r\nhave shown the merit of prioritizing children’s perspectives and experiences or minimally setting\r\nthem alongside the perspectives of adults in order to understand their lives and concerns fully. This\r\nthesis builds on these studies by exploring the lives of children living in poverty that go beyond\r\ntheir material disadvantage or survival. It highlights the priorities, concerns and responses of\r\nchildren living in a context different from the one covered by most of these studies. It also explores\r\nthe theoretical concepts of coping and resilience to establish whether these constructs can be\r\nreliably applied in a society that is very different from the one in which they were developed.\r\nThe study focuses on Ethiopia, one of the poorest countries in the world.

The key finding of the study is that the majority of these children\r\nperceive that relationships that are characterized by conflict are more damaging than material\r\npoverty. This suggests that research and interventions focusing on poverty not only undermine\r\nchildren’s positive experiences and agency but also obscure their real priorities and concerns. The\r\nchildren’s accounts further suggest that the theoretical concepts of “coping” and “resilience” are\r\napplicable to Ethiopian children, although as in other contexts how the children understand and\r\nexperience them is influenced by the culture and environment in which they live.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gebru, Bethlehem"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109179,"sim:weight":0.419328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108845,"sim:weight":0.39453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.385566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109198,"sim:weight":0.369241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108244,"sim:weight":0.364018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.345256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.252161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.243963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.225961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The research described in this thesis\r\ncomprises an extensive experimental study of a single component adsorption\r\nprocess onto square and hexagonal channel Novacarb™ ACM supplied by MAST\r\nCarbon Technology Ltd.\r\nACM characterisation methods such as nitrogen and solvent adsorption\r\nisotherms, electron microscopy, thermo-gravimetric analysis and thermal dynamic\r\ncharacterization have been used. High BET surface area, high total pore volume\r\nand high total solvent mass uptakes have been found. ACM were tested by\r\nobtaining column breakthrough curves mainly using dichloromethane and acetone\r\nas the adsorbates at the bench-scale. The adsorption dynamics of the ACMs\r\nstudied were also compared with those of extrudates manufactured by the same\r\nprocess as the ACMs. The influence of humidity on the adsorption process has\r\nbeen studied at the bench-scale. Finally, the adsorption system was scaled-up to\r\nabout 60cm length monoliths in order to study both adsorption and electrical\r\nregeneration taking advantage of the particular electrical properties held by the\r\nNovacarb™ ACM.\r\nIt has been found that ACMs are able to adsorb high levels of VOCs, up to\r\n40% by weight of DCM, good behaviour under humidity conditions and low\r\npressure drop. In contrast, kinetics of ACMs have been found to be somewhat\r\ninferior to those of equivalent packed beds, although the ACM performance can be\r\nimproved by reducing the wall thickness. Adsorption of DCM at the pilot-scale\r\nhas demonstrated that the Novacarb™ ACM could easily be used in a cyclic\r\nthermal swing adsorption process with a half cycle time of less than one hour.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sanchez Liarte, Francisca"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5846357,"sim:weight":0.406003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60923,"sim:weight":0.316404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176859,"sim:weight":0.169102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53848,"sim:weight":0.167156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.14969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.149159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26546,"sim:weight":0.14221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108521,"sim:weight":0.115575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It\r\nis a unique process that is found in many bacteria, archaea and also in plant\r\nchloroplasts. Investigation of the bacterial and thylakoidal systems has revealed\r\nmuch of the substrates and the components involved in their translocation.\r\nUnfortunately, there are still many unanswered questions such as how substrates are\r\ndirected to the membrane and the actual mechanism of translocation.\r\nThis thesis specifically investigates the Tat pathway of halophilic and thermophilic\r\narchaea. To date, there has been a lack of research into the archaeal Tat pathway and\r\nit is possible that there are unique adaptations because of the extreme environments\r\nthat these organisms inhabit.

{"identifier":2805802,"ep:Repository":82,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Willingness to pay for renewable energy options in developing countries: the case of Kenya","bibo:abstract":"Modern energy services such as electricity offer social, economic and health\r\nbenefits, particularly for rural households who depend wholly and solely on traditional\r\nfuels. However, one of the impediments faced by rural households in connecting to these\r\nservices is the high cost of connection. Once a household is electrified by the grid, another\r\nproblem emerges which is service reliability from the grid-option. Some examples of such\r\nreliability problems are: high frequency of outages and their substantial duration. Hence, it\r\nis important to consider both the connection costs for nonelectrified households and service\r\nreliability for those who are already electrified. In this vein, this research aims to explore\r\nthe most efficient pathways to achieve higher levels of electricity connection and greater\r\nreliability, focusing on rural households in Kenya. To achieve this, a face-to-face household\r\nsurvey consisting of 200 nonelectrified and 202 electrified households was conducted in\r\nKisumu district in August 2007.\r\nTwo hypothetical stated preference methods are employed, these being a contingent\r\nvaluation approach for nonelectrified households and a choice experiment for electrified\r\nhouseholds. The empirical model used for the contingent valuation includes a double\r\nbounded logit, whereas for choice experiment a mixed logit is applied. In the case of\r\ncontingent valuation, the double bounded logit is preferable due to the double bounded\r\nquestion format used in the household survey. For the choice experiment, the mixed logit is\r\napplied owing to the preference heterogeneity which was found among respondents with\r\nregards to the reliability of electricity services.\r\nThe results from the double bounded logit model revealed that among nonelectrified\r\nhouseholds the willingness to pay for two electricity sources, namely grid and photovoltaic\r\nsystems, differed. Respondents were willing to pay more for grid electricity than a solar\r\nphotovoltaic system. Moreover, those who were older and had lived longer in the area were\r\nless inclined to pay for electricity connection, whereas those who had higher incomes and\r\nthose interested in using electricity for home business purposes, were found to be more in\r\nfavour of connection to electricity services than those exhibiting the converse\r\nxi\r\ncharacteristics. Question order effect was also investigated for the contingent valuation\r\nmethod, and it emerged that the overall mean/median willingness to pay was unaffected by\r\nthe product and payment effects. In addition, monthly payments were found to be more\r\npopular than lump sum for connection. The mixed logit estimation for choice experiment\r\nprovided insights into respondents’ heterogeneity with regards to the socio-economic and\r\ndemographic variables. It emerged that those who were: unemployed, older and lived\r\nlonger in the area, were less likely than their counterparts to pay in excess of their monthly\r\nelectricity bill to reduce outages. Moreover, those who had a larger family, were engaged in\r\nfarming and/or had a bank account were willing to pay more for better service reliability.\r\nThe findings also demonstrated that for both grid and solar photovoltaic systems\r\nhouseholds preferred monthly payments to one time lump sum. Moreover, it was found that\r\na much higher proportion of households would be able to undertake payments by\r\ninstalments. In light of this, this researcher posits that policy makers should extend\r\nfinancial schemes to take into account the possibility of households paying by instalments\r\nand devise mechanisms through which payback periods can be prolonged. The results of\r\nthis research indicate that if photovoltaic electricity connection were subsidized by one\r\nthird by the Government of Kenya, 70% of the households would be able to afford to be\r\nconnected. With regards to the quality of service reliability, this research has identified the\r\nimportance of assessing the influence that different socio-economic and demographic\r\ncharacteristics play in determining preferences. That is to say, once those characteristics\r\nwhich are favourable for greater reliability are known, policy makers should target these\r\ngroups by developing service differentiation to accommodate different household\r\npreferences. This could prove very difficult as shown by the case of India where irrigated\r\nfarmers were provided a preferential tariff among other electrified groups. However, this\r\nresearcher would contend that this procedure would be preferable to that of having no\r\nprogramme at all. In conclusion, all these findings are useful for increasing rural\r\nelectrification and improving the quality of electricity service for rural households in\r\ndeveloping countries. This would lead to a decreased dependency of such populations on\r\ntraditional fuels that have adverse effect on their socio-economic environment and their\r\nhealth and well-being.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abdullah, Sabah"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.262237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109073,"sim:weight":0.253071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108730,"sim:weight":0.252831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.239466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.239466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108302,"sim:weight":0.224087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85823,"sim:weight":0.166146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Porous media with controlled pore sizes and\r\ngeometry can be used to mimic a variety of reservoir rock structures, as it can be\r\nengineered to consist of a network of elements which, individually, could have either\r\nregular or irregular converging and diverging portions. The restrictions in these\r\nelements are called throats, and the bulges pores. Catalysts developed from a range of\r\nNanotechnology applications could be used in down-hole catalytic upgrading of heavy\r\noil. They could also be used as catalyst supports or to analyse the coking performance\r\nof catalysts. These studies will highlight the pore structure effects associated with\r\ncapillary trapping mechanisms in rocks, and potentially allow the manipulation of\r\ntransport rates of fluids within the pore structure of catalysts.\r\n\r\nMercury-injection capillary pressure is typically favoured for geological applications\r\nsuch as inferring the size and sorting of pore throats. The difference between mercury\r\ninjection and withdrawal curves will be used to provide information on recovery\r\nefficiency, and also to investigate pore level heterogeneity. Mercury porosimetry studies\r\nare carried out to provide a better understanding of the retraction curve and the\r\nmechanisms controlling the extrusion process and subsequently the entrapment of the\r\nnon-wetting phase. The use of model porous media with controlled pore size and\r\nsurface chemistry allows these two effects to be de-convolved and studied separately.\r\nThe nanotechnology techniques employed mean that uncertainty regarding exact pore\r\ngeometry is alleviated because tight control of pore geometry is possible. Trapping of\r\noil and gas on a microscopic scale in a petroleum reservoir rock is affected by the\r\ngeometric and topologic properties of the pores, by the properties of the fluids and by\r\nproperties related to fluid-rock interaction such as wettability. Several distinct\r\nmechanisms of trapping may occur during displacement of one fluid by another in a\r\nporous media, however in strongly water-wet rocks with large aspect ratios, trapping in\r\nindividual pores caused by associated restricting throats (may be/is) the most important\r\nmechanism of trapping.

By providing a better understanding of the relationship between reservoir rock\r\npore space geometry and surface chemistry on the residual oil levels, a more accurate\r\nassessment of the potential of a particular reservoir could be generated.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of gas adsorption/desorption isotherms is widely used for the\r\ncharacterization of porous materials with regard to their surface area, pore size, pore\r\nsize distribution and porosity, which is important for optimizing their use in many\r\npractical applications. Although nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature is\r\nconsidered to be the standard procedure, recent studies clearly reveal that the use of\r\nadditional probe molecules (e.g. argon, butane, carbon dioxide, water, hydrogen, and\r\nhydrocarbons e.g. cyclohexane and ethane) allows not only to check for consistency, but\r\nalso leads to a more comprehensive and accurate micro/mesopore size analysis of many\r\nadsorbents. Furthermore, significant progress has been achieved during recent years\r\nwith regard to the understanding of the adsorption mechanism of fluids in materials with\r\nhighly ordered pore structures (e.g., M41S materials, SBA-15). This has led to major\r\nimprovements in the pore size analysis of nanoporous materials. However, there are still\r\nmany open questions concerning the phase and sorption behaviour of fluids in more\r\ncomplex pore systems, such as materials of a heterogeneous nature/differing pore\r\nstructures, which are of interest for practical applications in catalysis, separation, and\r\nadsorption. In order to address some of these open questions, we have performed\r\nsystematic adsorption experiments on novel nanoporous materials with well defined\r\npore structure synthesised within this research and also on commercial porous silicas.\r\nThe results of this study and experiments allow understanding and separating in detail\r\nthe influence of phenomena such as, pore blocking, advanced condensation and delayed\r\ncondensation on adsorption hysteresis and consequently the shape of the adsorption\r\nisotherms.

I combined well described methods with a recently developed imaging technique, Optical Projection Tomography (OPT), to show analysis of these expression patterns in 3D.  To investigate the eventual position of the descendants of cells of the early limb bud, I created a long-term fate map of the chick wing with use of the GFP-positive transgenic chicken.

The data were collected during a study of the noise which can cause hearing damage and, possibly, distraction in riders. They consisted of simultaneous measurements of noise at the rider\u0027s ear and unsteady pressure on the helmet surface, combined with GPS measurements of rider position and speed. These signals have been analyzed to educe the coherent structures in the turbulent flow responsible for noise generation. The identified structures appear to be produced by a vortex street shed by the motorcycle windscreen. The internal and external pressures proved to be poorly correlated over most of the frequency range, which has been identified as a result of the insertion loss of the helmet. The implications of these findings are that the majority of variation in helmet noise is a function of such extrinsic factors as motorcycle configuration and rider build and position. Efforts to reduce the harmful effects of noise in motorcycling should, then, move to studying the whole system of rider, helmet, motorcycle and external environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carley, Michael","Holt, Nigel","Walker, Ian"],"dc:date":"2010-04-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1925702,"sim:weight":0.310506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.304357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24691,"sim:weight":0.273288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108148,"sim:weight":0.189928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.15153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26771,"sim:weight":0.139567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87921,"sim:weight":0.128367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.117507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108758,"sim:weight":0.106444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9563,"sim:weight":0.0954409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The best surface obtained (MPWB1K/6-31+G(d,p) corrected AMI/TIP3P) contains a shallow free-energy well corresponding to an oxacarbenium ion intermediate in a stepwise mechanism. Molecular dynamics analysis at three temperatures leads to a classical estimate of the lifetime of the methoxymethyl cation in water; when quantum corrections for vibrational zero-point energy are included, the lifetime is estimated to be 1 ps.

Similarly, Polanyi emphasised the distinction between large scale \u0027General Purpose Money\u0027 and smaller scale non-national ‘Special Purpose Currencies’ (SPCs).  Non-national currencies, by complementing existing national currencies, form alternative or Complementary Currencies (CCs).  CC advocates observe that while institutions which issue General Purpose Money tend to use closed (non-transparent and non-participatory) governance processes, CC institutions, particularly when sponsored by local communities, may offer potential models for more participatory forms of monetary governance.  This study applies established governance principles to monetary decision-making, highlighting the importance of regulatory frameworks, transparency, accountability and direct participatory input for all currency users.  It further explores whether national regulations and scale inhibit attempts by monetary institutions to allow full stakeholder access to monetary governance.  To facilitate this exploration, a comparative analytical framework, called “Shared Monetary Governance” (SMG), is developed that allows the evaluation of distinct types of currency institutions.  Its application in the cases of four currencies from the USA - the US Dollar, Humboldt Exchange Dollars, Time Dollars, and Deli Dollars -   aims to enhance our understanding of how the degree of SMG is affected by three interrelated factors: national regulatory frameworks, internal decision-making processes, and scale.  The four currencies are therefore evaluated across three sets of criteria: Regulatory Framework toleration (11 indices), Participatory Internal Decision-making (15 indices), and scale (indexed by function and geography).  This methodology empirically compares each set to determine how each interrelated influence affects monetary governance and therefore stakeholder ability to influence priority setting.  It finds that community-based currency institutions, part of the group of CCs, tend to allow greater SMG.  Such findings imply that a multi-level interconnected monetary system including community-based, national and international money may facilitate greatest stakeholder access.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Destinie A"],"dc:date":"2010-05-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Here I investigate sexual conflict in the context of parental care by focussing on two questions: (i) which behavioural, morphological and environmental traits influence the parents’ decision to care for the brood or desert? (ii) How does sexual conflict influence the evolution of behaviour and morphology? I investigate both questions using a small, polygamous passerine bird, the Eurasian penduline tit Remiz pendulinus, which exhibits intense sexual conflict over parental care such that either the male, the female or both parents desert the clutch. Using detailed behavioural observations during the crucial few days preceding desertion, I argue that it may be in the parents’ best interest to conceal their intention to care for (or desert) their brood. The rapid resulting process that leads to variable parental care resembles a coordination game in which either parent may desert first. I developed a game-theoretical model that suggests that a key to resolving the conflict between parents is the sex difference in reproductive payoffs for given parental care strategies, rather than differences in parental quality per se. Environmental variables (e.g. food availability and mating opportunities) seem only subsidiary in the decision-making process of parents. My final chapter explores ramifications of sexual conflict at an evolutionary timescale. By comparing the highly polygamous Eurasian penduline tit with the monogamous Cape penduline tit, I show that morphological and behavioural differences between these two species are consistent with predictions of sexual conflict theory. During my PhD I also identified that there is considerable variation in breeding systems within different species of penduline\r\ntits. I argue that by studying these systems new insights will emerge into (i) the drivers of breeding systems, and (ii) neural and genomic traits that underlie breeding\r\nsystem evolution.","bibo:AuthorList":["van Dijk, Rene E."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9611582,"sim:weight":0.467962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2806257,"sim:weight":0.411574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2805290,"sim:weight":0.397227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2813802,"sim:weight":0.33891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.222943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108618,"sim:weight":0.222881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108971,"sim:weight":0.200453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85444,"sim:weight":0.192535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.123173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The second chapter critically reviews the range of synthetic\r\nmethodology that is currently available for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral #-lactones that\r\nare either natural products or useful chiral building blocks for synthesis. The third chapter\r\ndescribes the development of novel methodology for the epoxidation/lactonisation of a range of\r\n$-vinyl-syn-aldols to directly afford !-lactones containing up to four contiguous stereocentres in\r\nhigh de. These reactions were shown to proceed via a mechanism whereby hydroxyl-directed\r\ndiastereoselective epoxidation is followed by intramolecular attack of their !-acyl-oxazolidin-2-\r\none fragment, to directly afford the desired chiral !-lactone. The ‘self-cleavage’ aspect of these\r\nreactions was exploited to enable this methodology to be transferred to polymer-support using\r\nan immobilised Evans’-oxazolidin-2-one for asymmetric synthesis.\r\n\r\nChapter 4 describes the development of a complementary methodology for the asymmetric\r\nsynthesis of this type of hydroxylated !-lactone based on a strategy involving dihydroxylation of\r\nN-acyl-oxazolidin-2-one-$-vinyl-syn-aldols using catalytic amounts of osmium tetroxide. This\r\nmethodology was developed as part of a reinvestigation of previously reported dihydroxylation\r\nreactions by Dias and coworkers, where we have clearly shown that the stereochemistry of thelactones reported in their paper have been incorrectly assigned. This diastereoselective dihydroxylation methodology has been successfully applied to the asymmetric synthesis of the\r\nnatural product deoxyribonolactone.\r\n\r\nFinally, Chapter 5 describes the development of methodology for the asymmetric synthesis of\r\nchiral \"-lactones containing four contiguous stereocentres of use as potential chiral building\r\nblocks for the synthesis of polyketide natural products.

The protein has been shown to bind copper within its unstructured N-terminus but the affinity and stoichiometry of the association is a matter of some debate. In addition, the functional significance of this copper binding has yet to be elucidated. This study aimed to determine accurate metal binding parameters for PrP through the use of calorimetry and to provide insight into the potential redox implications of metal once bound. A method of analysis for complex binding to proteins is thoroughly assessed and found to be suitable. The study also aimed to qualify the involvement of metals in the proteins remarkable ability to survive in the environment.\r\n\r\nThis study confirms that PrP binds copper with an affinity relative to the amount of copper available to the protein. A high nanomolar affinity is reported within two regions on the protein, the octarepeat and the 5th site. Binding within the octarepeat region is found to be highest at low copper concentrations, reducing to micromolar affinity when copper levels exceed equivalents of 1. There is also strong evidence of a complex and cooperative binding mechanism. The 5th site also displays high nanomolar affinity for a single atom of copper. These two regions on the protein also interact in the coordination of copper (II). The copper bound protein is highly redox active and is capable of fully reversible cycling of electrons that are dependent mainly on the octarepeat. The protein does bind other divalent cations but none appear to be physiologically relevant considering the amount of these free metal ions in the body. When adsorbed to model clays, PrP is able to survive for long periods at room temperature. This longevity is increased significantly by the presence of metals in the soil, especially manganese.\r\n\r\nThese data provide confirmation of the precise parameters of divalent cation binding to PrP.

Among the various DNA repair pathways used by halophilic archaea, photoreactivation is the simplest and most efficient reversal mechanism. In this light-dependent process, the monomeric enzyme, photolyase, repairs the DNA lesion and causes the splitting of the cyclobutane ring via the absorption of visible light.  This mechanism has been observed in several species of halophilic archaea, where light repair results in higher cell survival than dark repair.  \r\nAnnotation of the complete genome sequence of the UV-tolerant haloarcheon, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 has identified 2 photolyase-like genes, phr 1 and phr 2 where knock-out studies have confirmed the function of the encoded Phr2 protein as a CPD photolyase.  However, this protein has not been expressed and functionally characterized from any halophilic archaeon known to date.  With this in mind, a project was designed to investigate the expression and function of the phr encoded proteins from Haloferax volcanii with the aim to elucidate their function in DNA repair.  Haloferax volcanii is a halophilic archaeon that grows optimally at 42 degree C under pH7, and requires an optimum salt concentration between 1.5M -2.5M.  \r\nUsing the known phr gene sequences from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, two putative gene homologues, phr1 and phr2, were identified from the unannotated Hfx. volcanii genome.  Homology modelling to known photolyase structures of Escherichia coli and Anacystis nidulans was conducted where the hypothetical structure of the protein closely resembled a deavaflavin type of photolyase containing the 8-HDF chromophore.    The putative genes were amplified and transformed into the native strain to observe an over-expression of the Phr proteins.  Due to the low copy number of the vector used, protein expression was too low to be detected; this led to a modification scheme for the vector to include a polyhistidine tag upstream of the gene for Nickel affinity purification.  This strategy resulted in the purification of a native protein, pitA, a reflection of the low expression of Phr2 in the native strain.  Heterologous expression in E. coli hosts resulted in the production of inclusion bodies that required renaturation to re-gain the protein native conformation.  The Phr2 protein was purified, solubilised using 8M urea and refolded using various tested refolding buffers.  Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the refolded protein has secondary structures with a high ratio of α-helixes.  \r\nA novel in-vivo assay developed for detecting the UV-sensitivity of the native overexpression strain strongly confirmed a photoreactivating function of the phr2-encoded protein but not for the phr1-encoded gene product.  A cell viability assay indicated that white light illumination resulted in higher cell numbers for the Phr2 strain post UV irradiation.  Lastly, an immunoassay was used for the detection of photoreactivating activity of the re-folded protein and the native over-expression strain.  Results indicated that while the re-folded protein did not exhibit repair, the native over-expression strain once again showed a white light enhancement of repair of dimers.  \r\nThese results and findings are discussed in context with the current literature on photoreactivation and DNA repair in other halophilic archaea.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wu, Winnie"],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.201678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929813,"sim:weight":0.18934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.150245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930158,"sim:weight":0.142831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26718,"sim:weight":0.103495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this project was to explore the patterns of nucleotide changes evident between the core genomes of nine E. coli and Shigella strains, with the latter having adopted a specific ecological niche in the recent evolutionary past. The Shigellae and E. coli show little difference in their extant genome compositions, in terms of nucleotide composition and genome size, however there are a markedly higher number of pseudogenes and insertion sequences present in the Shigella genomes. The polymorphism profiles of the core genomes reveal a time-dependency of dN/dS, Ti/Tv, +AT/+GC and the Metabolic cost of Amino acid changes, the nucleotide data showing a clear separation of the E. coli from the Shigellae, with the latter showing trends indicative of weaker purifying selection. Additionally these differences are evident when examining the nucleotide ratios (+AT/+GC \u0026 Ti/Tv) along the core genome, also revealing patterns of evolution associated with genome position. A simulation based approach reveals different projected nucleotide contents for the E. coli and Shigellae genomes further highlighting their different evolutionary paths as evident from the polymorphism profiles. The methods employed and developed in this study provide a useful and effective toolset for examining the evolution of bacterial genomes over short timescales, especially in light of the availability of multiple whole genome sequences for a given ‘species’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Balbi, Kevin J"],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2807819,"sim:weight":0.262781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.164239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.157316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.157316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86227,"sim:weight":0.111215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85198,"sim:weight":0.110594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The models are solved by\r\nthe method of finding a linear approximation to the first order condition proposed by\r\nKing, Plosser and Rebelo (1988). By using the Baxter and King band pass filter to\r\nextract the cyclical component, we find that the volatility of investment and government\r\nspending are higher than that of aggregate output. The striking feature in developing\r\ncountries, including Thailand, is that consumption is more volatile than output. These\r\nvariables in general are pro-cyclical and highly persistent. Net exports are highly volatile\r\nand counter-cyclical. The business cycle features of developing countries tend to be\r\nmore volatile than those of developed countries. The output fluctuations of the Asian\r\ncountries are positively correlated.\r\nA real business cycle model is constructed and it includes permanent, pure and realistic\r\nshocks to technology and government spending. The technology shock of Thai economy\r\nduring 1993-2006 is significantly persistent. The government spending shock cannot\r\ngenerate the real business cycle properties. The multiple shocks and the shocks off\r\nsteady state are introduced to alternatively study the effect of fiscal policy by replicating\r\nthe 1997 Asian crisis. The government spending seems to have a limited applicability\r\nfor this model. The model fails to explain a high volatility of consumption. The\r\ndifference between theory and data is also present in the volatility and contemporaneous\r\ncorrelation with output of labour, wages and interest rate.\r\nA one good two country international real business cycle model with complete market in\r\nline with Baxter and Crucini (1995) is built to explain the international facts of Thailand.\r\nThe relationship between the Thai real aggregate fluctuations and those of the US from\r\n1993-2006 is investigated. Technology spillovers significantly transfers from the US to\r\nThailand, not another way around. The contemporaneous correlation of technology\r\ninnovation of Thailand and the US is negative. The impulse response is done for\r\npermanent and realistic shocks of technology, government spending and taxation. The\r\nshocks off the steady state and the multiple shocks are also explored in the context of the\r\nopen economy model. It is obvious from this analysis that large countries do not respond\r\nto small country shocks. Small countries, particular openness, are dominated by large\r\niii\r\ncountry shocks. The responses in Thailand are significant if the shocks are originated in\r\nthe US. The model requires a high variance of technology innovation to explain the Thai\r\nfacts. The shock in the US can explain the co-movement in Thailand better than the\r\nshock originates in Thailand itself. The model performs poorly to match the data in term\r\nof international co-movement and predicts that the cross correlation of consumption is\r\nhigher than that of output.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wongpunya, Nipit"],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1573447,"sim:weight":0.334041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930801,"sim:weight":0.312261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108691,"sim:weight":0.271637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.224796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108919,"sim:weight":0.18936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In use it was found that the recently developed member adding technique in particular was pivotal in permitting real-world scale problems to be tackled in the first place (this allows single load-case problems containing up to approx. 1,000,000,000 potential truss members to be solved on a desktop PC). However, many practically important issues requiring resolution were identified, and these are briefly discussed in the paper. One specific issue is considered in more detail in the paper; this concerns the specification of external applied loads, something which appears to have received scant attention in the literature to date. Whereas in a conventional layout optimization problem the spatial locations of external applied loads are predefined, in practice, e.g. for roof structures, this may be inappropriate since this strongly influences the form of the resulting ’optimum’ structure. In an attempt to overcome this, loads were instead applied to groups of nodes. The technique proved to be remarkably successful, and typical results are presented in the paper.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gilbert, Matthew","Darwich, Wael","Tyas, Andy","Shepherd, Paul"],"dc:date":"2005-05-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26227,"sim:weight":0.369049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108738,"sim:weight":0.162918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We examined consequences of variation in sexual conflict in two closely-related passerine birds with contrasting breeding systems: the Eurasian penduline tit Remiz pendulinus (EPT) exhibiting a highly polygamous breeding system with sexually antagonistic interests over parental care, and the socially monogamous Cape penduline tit Anthoscopus minutus (CPT). We derived four a priori predictions from sexual conflict theory and tested these using data collected in Central Europe (EPT) and South Africa (CPT). Firstly, we predicted that EPTs exhibit more sexually dimorphic plumage than CPTs due to more intense sexual selection. Secondly, we expected brighter EPT males to provide less care than duller males. Thirdly, since song is a sexually selected trait in many birds, male EPTs were expected to exhibit more complex songs than CPT males. Finally, intense sexual conflict in EPT was expected to lead to low nest attendance as an indication of sexually antagonistic interests, whereas we expected more cooperation between parents in CPT consistent with their socially monogamous breeding system.\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eResults: Consistent with our predictions EPTs exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in plumage and more complex song than CPTs, and brighter EPT males provided less care than duller ones.

Our results are also consistent with the notion that EPTs attempt to force their partner to work harder as expected under sexual conflict: each member of the breeding pair attempts to shift the costs of care to the other parent. More brightly colored males benefit more from desertion than dull ones, because they are more likely to remate with a new female.

However, available\r\nmethods of assessment are often conservative, and the actual strength may be\r\nsufficient to sustain the specified assessment load. Therefore, it is important that\r\nrealistic assessment methods are employed.\r\nThis research comprises an investigation into the shear capacity of prestressed\r\nconcrete bridges and into the feasibility of a novel strengthening approach, both\r\nthrough comprehensive laboratory experimentation and theoretical analyses. The\r\nlaboratory testing indicates that the shear capacity of prestressed concrete bridges,\r\npost-tensioned transversely to form a deck, can be significantly greater than\r\nsuggested by the relevant standards. The strengthening method proposed, namely\r\ndeep embedment of steel or fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars, is found to be\r\nfeasible and very effective for reinforced concrete (RC) and prestressed concrete\r\n(PSC) beams of any size.\r\nAnalytical models based on the upper-bound theorem of plasticity theory are\r\nsuccessfully developed and applied, resulting in much more realistic predictions\r\nthan those from current standards and codes when assessing shear capacity. For\r\nthe strengthened beams, in addition to an upper-bound model, a strengthening\r\ndesign method based on a truss analogy is developed, which can be directly\r\nimplemented into codes of practice.\r\nThe analytical methods permit the assessment of existing longitudinally and\r\nlaterally prestressed concrete bridges for shear capacity in a rational manner, and\r\nthen to determine the capacity of a practical shear strengthening system if the\r\nbridge turns out to actually be understrength. Use of the proposed methodology will\r\nallow significant savings, as the costs associated with replacing or strengthening\r\nthe structure can be avoided or minimised, encouraging a sustainable approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Valerio, Pierfrancesco"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Using genotypes of nine microsatellite loci of 443 offspring and 211 adults, we test whether extra-pair paternity predicts parental care. We expect males to be more likely to desert cuckolded broods, whereas we expect females, if they obtain benefits from having multiple sires, to be more likely to care for broods with multiple paternity. Our results suggest that parental care is not adjusted to parentage on an ecological timescale. Furthermore, we found that male attractiveness does not predict cuckoldry, and we found no evidence for indirect benefits for females (i.e., increased growth rates or heterozygosity of extra-pair offspring). We argue that male Eurasian penduline tits may not be able to assess the risk of cuckoldry; thus, a direct association with parental care is unlikely to evolve. However, timing of desertion (i.e., when to desert during the egg-laying phase) may be influenced by the risk of cuckoldry. Future work applying extensive gene sequencing and quantitative genetics is likely to further our understanding of how selection may influence the association between parentage and parental care.","bibo:AuthorList":["Van Dijk, Rene E","Mészáros, Lidia A","Velde, Marco","Székely, T","Pogány, A","Szabad, J","Komdeur, Jan"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2805290,"sim:weight":0.462298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2813802,"sim:weight":0.423828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2806052,"sim:weight":0.411574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108971,"sim:weight":0.205769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386098,"sim:weight":0.203484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108618,"sim:weight":0.169045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.168168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.145094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The investigation is carried out by comparing and analysing parallel translations of French source texts into English target texts, using a number of methods. The main focus is on how translator behaviour influences the translation process, how this is reflected in the resulting target text and what the consequences are in terms of translation quality. The study aims to demonstrate the influence of personalities in translation, and better understand how they affect the loss or gain of certain elements during the translation task. Chapter 1 focuses on the review of different theories and models in TS which shed light on the translator’s context and on the different factors that can potentially affect the way in which he behaves. It also reviews the few studies that have been carried out on translator behaviour, and more specifically on personality-related behaviour. Chapter 2 is dedicated to the three experiments carried out, which highlight patterns of behaviour in student translations through textual analysis, verbalisations, questionnaires and a personality test. These various methods used to investigate the process aim to emphasize and substantiate the claim that translators’ personalities play an active part in the decision-making process of translator behaviour. The final chapter summarises the implications of the findings, and concludes that each translator’s personality is apparent in their attitudinal behaviours when translating, influences their performance in varied ways, and shapes their target text. In addition, appropriate recommendations for further research and training are also made.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hubscher-Davidson, Severine Emmanuelle"],"dc:date":"2007-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Indeed it is widely acknowledged that there are many diverse methods available to the empirical researcher. There are also a number of ways in which these can be compared or controlled. Ultimately, however, all of these techniques aim to develop some form of rigour, validity, replicability and understanding in the wider design research community. This paper brings these discussions together acknowledging their differences but also drawing out a number of fundamental similarities in order to identify and address the key barriers to success. Further it goes on to argue that these fall into an overarching theoretical frame from which common factors and issues can be identified and recognised. This is then used to structure the argument for a broader understanding and reporting of contextual and social factors while also offering a more focused discussion of empirical information gathering and experimental planning. This discussion is intended to act as an overview of the issues an empirical researcher must be aware of and to offer some guidance of how they can start to address these data collection and validity issues as part of their experimental design. The paper is also aimed at bringing together and moving forward the discussion on what constitutes good empirical research, what its influences are and how design research as a community can set about mitigating them. The paper focuses on the research and methodological aspects of design research. In this way design in industry is affected indirectly through improvements in design research quality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cash, Philip","Hicks, Ben","Culley, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58888,"sim:weight":0.41851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27527,"sim:weight":0.34215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108269,"sim:weight":0.307353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821113,"sim:weight":0.28988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.274329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.243048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In vertebrates, the mechanism of SHH signal transduction and its action on target genes by means of activating or repressing forms of GLI3 have been studied most extensively during limb development and the specification of the central nervous system. From these studies it has emerged, that Gli3 expression must be subject to a tight spatiotemporal regulation. However, the genetic mechanisms and the cis-acting elements controlling the expression of Gli3 remained largely unknown.\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eResults: Here, we demonstrate in chicken and mouse transgenic embryos that human GLI3-intronic conserved noncoding sequence elements (CNEs) autonomously control individual aspects of Gli3 expression. Their combined action shows many aspects of a Gli3-specific pattern of transcriptional activity. In the mouse limb bud, different CNEs enhance Gli3-specific expression in evolutionary ancient stylopod and zeugopod versus modern skeletal structures of the autopod. Limb bud specificity is also found in chicken but had not been detected in zebrafish embryos. Three of these elements govern central nervous system specific gene expression during mouse embryogenesis, each targeting a subset of endogenous Gli3 transcription sites. Even though fish, birds, and mammals share an ancient repertoire of gene regulatory elements within Gli3, the functions of individual enhancers from this catalog have diverged significantly. During evolution, ancient broad-range regulatory elements within Gli3 attained higher specificity, critical for patterning of more specialized structures, by abolishing the potential for redundant expression control. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eConclusion: These results not only demonstrate the high level of complexity in the genetic mechanisms controlling Gli3 expression, but also reveal the evolutionary significance of cis-acting regulatory networks of early developmental regulators in vertebrates.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbasi,  A.

The species Photorhabdus asymbiotica is able to infect humans as well as insects. We investigated the secreted proteome of a clinical isolate of P. asymbiotica at different temperatures in order to identify proteins relevant to the infection of the two different hosts.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e Results: A comparison of the proteins secreted by a clinical isolate of P. asymbiotica at simulated insect (28 degrees C) and human (37 degrees C) temperatures led to the identification of a small and highly abundant protein, designated Pam, that is only secreted at the lower temperature. The pam gene is present in all Photorhabdus strains tested and shows a high level of conservation across the whole genus, suggesting it is both ancestral to the genus and probably important to the biology of the bacterium. The Pam protein shows limited sequence similarity to the 13.6 kDa component of a binary toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis. Nevertheless, injection or feeding of heterologously produced Pam showed no insecticidal activity to either Galleria mellonella or Manduca sexta larvae. In bacterial colonies, Pam is associated with an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS)-like matrix, and modifies the ability of wild-type cells to attach to an artificial surface. Interestingly, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) binding studies revealed that the Pam protein itself has adhesive properties. Although Pam is produced throughout insect infection, genetic knockout does not affect either insect virulence or the ability of P. luminescens to form a symbiotic association with its host nematode, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e Conclusions: We studied a highly abundant protein, Pam, which is secreted in a temperature-dependent manner in P. asymbiotica. Our findings indicate that Pam plays an important role in enhancing surface attachment in insect blood. Its association with exopolysaccharide suggests it may exert its effect through mediation of EPS properties. Despite its abundance and conservation in the genus, we find no evidence for a role of Pam in either virulence or symbiosis.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones,  R.

The output of such systems consists of the mixed responses to both motor and sensory fibres, and to fibres of all diameters. Professor John Taylor et al. have invented a method for selective recording which allows nerve signals to be classified by conduction velocity (and therefore fibre diameter), in addition to improving the signal-to-noise ratio compared to conventional (tripolar) cuff. The method uses a Multi-electrode Cuff (MEC) and linear signal processing. It is expected to have many applications in neuroprosthetics. To show that the system does distinguish signals of different function that are carried in fibres of different diameter, it is to be tested by in-vivo experiments in animals. Acute experiments will test the understanding with compound action potentials (CAPs) and then naturally-occurring neural signals after surgical preparation and under several well-defined experimental conditions. This thesis presents the successful application of conduction velocity-selective ENG recording system to electrically evoked potentials using the frog sciatic nerve. But when it came to testing the recording system on naturally-occurring neural signals from the pig, time constraints and equipment malfunction did not allow for successful recordings. However, after extensive re-designing of the equipment and experiment set-up, a lot has been learnt when it comes to mounting a pig’s limb to a test rig and the mechanism behind this tri-segmented limb.

Since the 1970s, one source of information in Anglophone societies has come from individuals who have chosen to publicise their dying of cancer. This article examines the most high profile case of this to date in the UK; in 2009, celebrity Jade Goody publicised in tabloid newspapers and celebrity magazines the final weeks of her dying of cervical cancer. What did she and her media say and write about dying? This article examines the print coverage of her final weeks, and four different voices are identified: those of Goody, of journalists, of her publicist, and of photographers, each representing her dying somewhat differently. Two major themes are discussed: Jade\u0027s struggles to retain autonomy (challenged by her disease and by other people), and the framing of her final weeks not primarily as a typical media cancer story of heroism, but as one of redemption in which she attained social respectability through dying. In contemporary western societies, dying usually occurs in old age, out of sight in hospitals and institutions; it is something with which many people are, to quote Philippe Ariès (1983), ‘unfamiliar’. Since it is hard to promote citizen engagement with something with which citizens are unfamiliar, the UK government\u0027s End of Life Care Strategy for England includes a Dying Matters coalition, launched in March 2010 to promote public awareness around death, dying and bereavement (http://www.dyingmatters.org). The coalition\u0027s strapline is: ‘Dying Matters – let\u0027s talk about it’. In recent times in Britain, the person who talked most publicly and extensively about dying was Jade Goody, a young woman whose seven year celebrity career had been based on a personal and often crude ‘telling it like it is’ (Gies, 2009: 27); in 2009 she chose to publicise her dying from cervical cancer in a range of popular media, with high profile day by day accounts of her final weeks. This article analyses what Jade 1 and her media told the British public about what it is like to die of cancer. After sketching some previous research findings into Anglophone media reporting of cancer dying, I document the unprecedented coverage of Jade\u0027s dying. I then note the different voices in the media coverage: those of Jade herself, of her hired publicist, of journalists, and of photographers, before going on to examine how these four different voices represented her experience of dying of cancer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walter, Tony"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Yet radical changes in them, including a growth in secular ceremonies, can provide insight into contemporary discourse and society. This article considers the case of funerals. By contrasting the openings of a traditional religious (Christian) funeral, an updated version of the same, and a secular alternative, it seeks to elucidate the nature of pragmatic, semantic and linguistic changes. The argument is that the most significant contrast is not between religious and secular, but between traditional and contemporary, with the latter being marked by the reduced authority of the celebrant, greater personalization and choice, euphemistic reference to death, less poetic language, and diminished ritual movement. The article concludes with discussion of possible connections between these dimensions of change, and of the extent to which contemporary funerals can be regarded as rituals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cook, G","Walter, Tony"],"dc:date":"2005-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It was found that many hospices provided rites for the family, both immediately after death and in the year to come, although there were differing views regarding the extent to which other patients should be involved in such rites. The only hospices that became involved with the funeral itself were those who care for children and patients with AIDS. This may be related to the longer time over which a patient can build up relationships with other patients and staff. In some other hospices, funeral and memorial services were perceived by managers as morbid, fitting uncomfortably with the hospice emphasis on life.

This paper is based on the responses of the many Christians who were among informants in an interview study we conducted in 1997 in the south-west of England; our purpose was to investigate European Values Survey (EVS) statistics which suggest that around a quarter of all British people and, indeed, of Europeans more generally, believe in reincarnation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Waterhouse, H","Walter, Tony"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86060,"sim:weight":0.225987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176792,"sim:weight":0.221256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.190664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108530,"sim:weight":0.161676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.160597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108226,"sim:weight":0.158822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108526,"sim:weight":0.15156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108129,"sim:weight":0.151269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84888,"sim:weight":0.124945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Does this belief affect their practical morality and how they think about suffering and injustice? An interview study conducted in England mapped the range of meanings such people give to reincarnation, and found: 1) Karma was widely referred to, but in the context of Western notions of self-improvement; there was little recognition of the possibility of bad karma leading to ‘downward mobility’ in the next life, and little linking of karma to everyday action; 2) Reincarnation enabled respondents to make sense of suffering and injustice, but in a rather general way; 3) Despite the sample\u0027s elderly bias, reincarnation was not widely reported as a comfort in illness and bereavement. The authors conclude that, outside of a culture or formal religion that embraces it, relatively high levels of personal interest in reincarnation can coincide with rather insubstantial effects on everyday morality, though individuals can and do use it to think about problems of suffering and injustice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walter, Tony","Waterhouse, Helen"],"dc:date":"2001-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The extent of medicine\u0027s colonisation of grief is found to be limited. Though some mourners make a point of rejecting semi-psychiatric terms, others use such terms to structure their accounts of grief. A broader analysis shows that the policing of grief often occurs without reference to medical terminology and in several arenas outside the medical: in a patriarchal and controlling general culture, in family dynamics, and in counselling and mutual-help groups. Three issues are looked at in some detail: the role of women\u0027s liberation in allowing more expressive and personalised grief talk, the suppression of grief talk in the cause of retaining emotional equilibrium within the family, and the exclusion by mutual-help groups of some accounts even as they include others. Resistance is directed as much to face-to-face policing in families and other groups as to grief\u0027s medicalistion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walter, Tony"],"dc:date":"2000-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5225643,"sim:weight":0.382721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108300,"sim:weight":0.285571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.181146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.165099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108891,"sim:weight":0.156368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.154733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.150848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108900,"sim:weight":0.147957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.145753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.14524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.118268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56557,"sim:weight":0.117109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We derive a generalisation of the New Keynesian Phillips curve in which inflation is a nonlinear function of the output gap and show that the optimal response of the policy rule to inflation depends on the slope of the Phillips curve; if this is flat, manipulation of aggregate demand through monetary policy does not affect inflation and so policymakers cannot affect inflation. We estimate the monetary policy rules implied by a variety of alternative Phillips curves; our preferred model is based on a Phillips curve that is flat when output is close to equilibrium. We find that policy rates do not respond to inflation when the output gap is small, a situation that characterised most of the “great moderation” period.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boinet, V","Martin, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108475,"sim:weight":0.402162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66167,"sim:weight":0.308922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30623,"sim:weight":0.281807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108691,"sim:weight":0.234068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It focuses on two key groups of pictures: the first presents the official and strategic narratives that were produced by the military; the second presents those taken by freelance photographers who were less subject to restrictions. Among the images in the latter group, a recurrent visual vocabulary has emerged that posits fleeing refugees in a particular way. However, a close analysis of the work of the American photographer Therese Bonney suggests very different kinds of visual narratives from those that are commonly taken to represent this experience, and also implies the existence of a possibly gendered narrative. This exploration therefore suggests that further research into the work of other photographers has the potential to uncover numerous visual narratives that nuance and complicate the existing dominant visual narratives of these events.","bibo:AuthorList":["Diamond, HE"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84996,"sim:weight":0.336624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.261621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66549,"sim:weight":0.248854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513322,"sim:weight":0.245043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227167,"sim:weight":0.240911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108696,"sim:weight":0.210877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.200196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.181147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Instead, the journal is seen as embedded in complex networks of institutions and practices over which the editorial team has limited control; chief among them are the conventions of peer review, the proliferation of academic journals, the escalating pressures on academics to publish and the ceaseless struggle to improve ranking and citations. A useful way of looking at the journal is as a place where, following different institutional practices, ideas arrive, settle and meet each other, sometimes fight it out or, more often than not, decide to coexist in a civilized and polite way. Like the spaces of large cities, journals too become spaces crucial for the formation of individual and group identities, something that is accompanied by much agonizing about quality, acceptance, purity, contamination and even annihilation. The paper concludes with some reflections on the ethic of rational critique, at once the bedrock of academic discourse but also capable of inflicting much damage and of prematurely closing promising lines of inquiry. The author proposes that this ethic must be complemented by an ethic of care which stems from a recognition of fallibility and limits to our rationality. An ethic of care must inform not only the interactions among a journal\u0027s different stakeholders but may spread to an attitude of stakeholders towards the journal itself, an attitude that approaches the journal as a valued intellectual space to be nurtured and cared for.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gabriel, Yiannis"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931512,"sim:weight":0.291754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.255462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.241463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.224443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.223757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108175,"sim:weight":0.209248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Microemulsion formulations were prepared using oleic acid as the oil phase, Tween20 as a surfactant, Transcutol (R) as cosurfactant, and water. The microemulsions were characterized visually, with the polarizing microscope, and by dynamic light scattering. In addition, the pH, conductivity (sigma) and viscosity (eta) of the formulations were measured. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry and diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to study the formulations investigated. Conductivity measurements revealed, as a function of the weight fraction of the aqueous phase, the point at which the microemulsion made the transition from water-in-oil to bicontinuous. Alterations in the microstructure of the microemulsions, following incorporation of testosterone, have been evaluated using the same physical parameters (pH, sigma and eta) and via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR. These methods were also used to determine the location of the drug in the colloidal formulation. Finally, testosterone delivery from selected formulations was assessed across porcine skin in vitro in Franz diffusion cells. The physical parameter determinations, combined with the spectroscopic studies, demonstrated that the drug was principally located in the oily domains of the microemulsions. Testosterone was delivered successfully across the skin from the microemulsions examined, with the highest flux achieved (4.6 +/- 0.6 mu g cm(-2) h(-1)) from a formulation containing 3% (w/v) of the active drug and the composition (w/w) of 16% oleic acid, 32% Tween20, 32% Transcutol (R) and 20% water. The microemulsions considered offer potentially useful vehicles for the transdermal delivery of testosterone.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hathout,  R. M.","Woodman, Timothy J.","Mansour,  S.","Mortada,  N.

In order to address such changes, applications need to be inherently flexible and adaptive, supported by appropriate infrastructures. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for the dynamic adaptation of Web services based on ontology-aware service templates. Model-driven engineering raises the level of abstraction from concrete Web service implementations to high-level service models, which leads to more flexible and automated adaptations through template designs and transformations. The ontological semantics enhances the service matching capabilities required by the dynamic adaptation process. Service templates are based on OWL-S descriptions and provide the necessary means to capture and parameterize specific behavior patterns of service models. In this paper, we apply our approach in the context of the EU-funded ALIVE project and illustrate, as an example, how the proposed framework supports the adaptation of the authentication mechanism used by an interactive tourist recommendation system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Staikopoulos, Athanasios","Cliffe, Owen","Popescu, Razvan","Padget, Julian","Clarke, Siobhán"],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108018,"sim:weight":0.514109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826955,"sim:weight":0.37363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1549752,"sim:weight":0.367472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998830,"sim:weight":0.358469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930718,"sim:weight":0.299374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1549556,"sim:weight":0.285949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.26666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931322,"sim:weight":0.245788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In recent years, a number of emerging bodies of literature have taken youth in the developing world as the objects of their analysis; the literature on youth in Thailand, studies of youth and development within the Thai and international spheres, and the new anthropology of youth each focus on the lives of young people – social, cultural and economic – and see youth as active agents in the creation of society, culture and the economy. This thesis, drawing on the analysis of ethnographic data, contends that each of these bodies of literature constructs young people in partial or misleading ways, and in particular that insufficient emphasis is placed on the unintended consequences that can ensue from everyday practice and the pursuit of dreams. It argues that if these emerging literatures on youth in the developing world are to adequately conceptualise and represent young people, then they must attend to these unintended consequences. As the thesis will demonstrate, doing so facilitates analysis of the ways in which different spheres of action affect each other, of the structures that constrain and enable young people, and of the way in which attempting to participate in dominant cultures can have profoundly counter-productive outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe thesis also explores some of the methodological processes involved in immersion in, and withdrawal from, „the field‟.

RESULTS: Cross-cultural data from 9,404 sick and well adults in 13 countries showed that environmental QoL increased positively and sequentially from no education to tertiary education. The other three domains increased only up to secondary school level. These MANCOVA results were significantly influenced by health status, age, culture and economic development level. More positive feelings, less dependence on medication and treatment, better perceptions of financial resources, physical environment, and opportunities for information and skills, represent adult QoL advantages to those who received tertiary education compared with secondary schooling. Developing countries reported poorer environmental, psychological and physical QoL than developed countries, although social QoL was good, and no different for the two development bands. Only psychological QoL distinguished between every educational level, in developing countries. Increased positive feelings serve to link better mental health with more education. Across each domain, secondary and tertiary education was associated with better QoL in developing countries. CONCLUSION: The results support a QoL case for universal secondary education on which better health and health care may be built.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skevington, Suzanne M","The WHOQOL Group, [No Value]"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

My analysis addresses three main concerns of these writers: youth culture, gender, and literary legacies. The Introduction provides the methodological coordinates of my study, stating my initial aims, tracing the evolution of my interest in the writers and of my approach to their narratives, and outlining the structure of the thesis. Chapter 1 identifies themes and styles common to the ‘pulp generation’, referring to the work of, among others, Niccolò Ammaniti, Silvia Ballestra, Enrico Brizzi, Rossana Campo, Giuseppe Culicchia, Aldo Nove, Isabella Santacroce, Tiziano Scarpa and Simona Vinci. I focus on the critical reception of these writers and the support they received from the members of 1960-70s avant-garde, Gruppo 63. In Chapter 2, I map out the links between the 1990s writers and some of the authors who emerged in the 1980s, and particularly Pier Vittorio Tondelli, teasing out similarities and differences between the two generations. The remaining three chapters are devoted to in-depth analyses of my three main writers, who have been selected for having already published a sizeable body of texts, for exhibiting a very distinctive evolution in themes, styles, and genres, and for having already acquired the status of ‘canonical’ writers of their generation. Chapter 3 on Ballestra, Chapter 4 on Campo, and Chapter 5 on Santacroce chart this evolution from their early postmodern fiction, dominated by youth themes and experimental language and structures, to more realist forms and mature themes of their later works, which combine a continued engagement with narrative form with a commitment to communication and with gender-oriented thematics. My investigation brings into relief the different treatment of these thematics and the styles adopted to convey them by the three authors. More importantly, it highlights the intertextual dialogue each one of them conducts with the tradition(s) of women’s writing, something that has been overlooked by critics in Italy and abroad. The Conclusion offers a brief sketch of the evolution of these three writers and of ‘pulp’ narrative in general.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bernardi, Claudia"],"dc:date":"2009-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1513322,"sim:weight":0.24109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.200607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.193111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.18862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.183391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Four particular issues are drawn out as urgently calling for further research—first, the extent to which genocide should be treated as an ‘exceptional’ event; second, the study of different types of genocide involving different forms of management, organization and violence; third, probing into the issue of whether genocide represents a failure of morality or an instance of exaggerated zeal in applying morality; and fourth, the study of the ways ‘othering’ is acted out, both at the broad level of victims and perpetrators, but also in creating a wide range of subdivisions, different degrees of victimhood and collusion, different choices and dilemmas and different modes of identity construction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stokes, P","Gabriel, Yiannis"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5227169,"sim:weight":0.180065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104012,"sim:weight":0.174592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.162358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.156759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108175,"sim:weight":0.148268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Nature generally achieves land movement by walking using legs, but additional modes such as climbing, jumping and rolling are all produced from legs as well. Robotics tends not to use this integrated approach and adds additional mechanisms to achieve additional movements. The spherical device described within this thesis, called Jollbot, integrated a rolling motion for faster movement over smoother terrain, with a jumping movement for rougher environments. Jollbot was developed over three prototypes. The first achieved pause-and-leap style jumps by slowly storing strain energy within the metal elements of a spherical structure using an internal mechanism to deform the sphere. A jump was produced when this stored energy was rapidly released. The second prototype achieved greater jump heights using a similar structure, and added direction control to each jump by moving its centre of gravity around the polar axis of the sphere. The final prototype successfully combined rolling (at a speed of 0.7 m/s, up 4° slopes, and over 44 mm obstacles) and jumping (0.5 m cleared height), both with direction control, using a 0.6 m spherical spring steel structure. Rolling was achieved by moving the centre of gravity outside of the sphere’s contact area with the ground. Jumping was achieved by deflecting the sphere in a similar method to the first and second prototypes, but through a larger percentage deflection. An evaluation of existing rough terrain robots is made possible through the development of a five-step scoring system that produces a single numerical performance score. The system is used to evaluate the performance of Jollbot.","bibo:AuthorList":["Armour, Rhodri H"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In this project the fundamentals of liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions in a structured compact multifunctional reactor were investigated. This technology represents an advance over the existing hydrogenation technologies because it exploits the effects of reduced characteristic paths of mass and heat transfer, attained in compact reactor architecture with mm-scale reaction channels and integrated static mixers and micro-heat exchangers.  Catalysts based on mesoporous synthetic carbons were developed especially for preparing micro-packed beds in the compact reactor.  The investigation resulted in fundamental information on reactor performance for selected model reactions, heat transfer efficiency of the integrated micro-heat exchangers, development of continuous tandem reaction, and evaluation of developed catalysts for hydrogenation and hydrodehalogenation reactions under the continuous flow conditions being used.

They compensate for the ionospheric delay using an ionospheric model which typically only corrects for 50% of the delay. An alternative approach is to map the ionosphere with a network of real-time measurements, with either a thin shell approximation or a full 3D map. Here, a time-dependent 3D tomographic imaging technique is used to map the free electron density over the full-height of the ionosphere during solar maximum. The navigation solutions computed using corrections based upon models and thin-shell and full-height maps are compared in this project. The models and maps are used to calculate the excess propagation delay on the L1 frequency experienced by GPS receivers at selected locations across Europe and North America. The excess delay is applied to correct the pseudo-range single frequency observations at each location and the improvements to the resulting positioning are calculated. It is shown that the thin-shell and full-height maps perform almost as well as a dual-frequency carrier-smoothed benchmark and for most receivers better than the unfiltered dual-frequency benchmark. It is also shown that the unfiltered dual-frequency method is not reliable, which is of concern as it is a proposed upgrade to current positioning systems. The improvements in positioning accuracy vary from day to day depending on ionospheric conditions but can be up to 25m during mid-day at solar maximum conditions at European mid-latitudes. The full-height corrections perform well under all geomagnetic conditions and are considerably better than thin-shell corrections under extreme storm conditions. The transmission of the navigation correction requires a forecast, an image compression and a system of distribution across a local region. The feasibility of this is demonstrated for regions of land and near-land coastal regions across Europe.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allain, Damien J"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69556,"sim:weight":0.354672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710707,"sim:weight":0.341743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":707649,"sim:weight":0.339409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711644,"sim:weight":0.331775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711943,"sim:weight":0.328911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710880,"sim:weight":0.314917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708526,"sim:weight":0.3137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69177,"sim:weight":0.312887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":712093,"sim:weight":0.312559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68735,"sim:weight":0.308309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69548,"sim:weight":0.299378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69159,"sim:weight":0.294925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26528,"sim:weight":0.288505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":712136,"sim:weight":0.283724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68027,"sim:weight":0.282324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":707941,"sim:weight":0.254999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710953,"sim:weight":0.239639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71069,"sim:weight":0.233899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710886,"sim:weight":0.214909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":712230,"sim:weight":0.211397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

With interconnected computing devices distributed in our habitat, services relevant to any situation may be always available to address our needs. However, despite the enhanced capabilities of mobile phones, users had been reluctant to adopt any services other than calls and messaging. This has been changing more recently, especially since the launch of the iPhone, with users getting access to hundreds of services. The original question motivating the research presented in this thesis “How can we improve mobile service usage?” is in the interest of enthusiasts of mobile services as well as slow adopters. We propose the concept of ‘mobile service awareness’ and operationalise it through the more focused research question: “How can we design for non-intrusive yet informative auditory mobile service notifications?” We design and conduct a series of surveys, laboratory experiments and longitudinal field studies to address this question. Our results, also informed by literature on context-aware computing, awareness, notification systems and auditory interface design, produce two distinct major contributions. First, we provide a set of conclusions on the relative efficiency of auditory icons and earcons as auditory notifications. Second, we produce a set of design guidelines for the two types of notifications, based on the critical evaluation of the methodologies we develop and adapt from the literature. Although these contributions were made with mobile service notification in mind, they are arguably useful for designers of any auditory interfaces conveying complex concepts (such as mobile services) and are used in attention demanding contexts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Garzonis, Stavros"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1549727,"sim:weight":0.396417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70121,"sim:weight":0.31992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393809,"sim:weight":0.295005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.255326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931989,"sim:weight":0.252443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70404,"sim:weight":0.250822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.244315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11127,"sim:weight":0.231515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59326,"sim:weight":0.231222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70126,"sim:weight":0.214066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512108,"sim:weight":0.201591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70175,"sim:weight":0.166921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Firstly, two common kinds of PCFs, that guide light by total internal\r\nreflection and by photonic bandgaps, are reviewed. Several typical PCF structures\r\nfor which light propagation is governed by weak mode interaction are then\r\ndiscussed and particularly compared with bandgap-guiding PCFs.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTwo independent methods are developed to model a set of related rectangular\r\nhollow-core PCF structures. The boundary element method is derived for a\r\ngeneral PCF configuration and applied to our model structures. This method\r\nnumerically provides some basic features about the guided modes, such as the\r\npropagation constant and field profile. The calculations show an ideal confinement\r\nin our model structure by considering a scalar wave equation and a high\r\ndielectric constant at the glass intersections.

The Kenyan economy is at a tipping point where skilled graduates are required but a lack of funding for HE means that only a small number of students are entering university each year. The aspirations of increasing numbers of qualified students are not being met. Without exploiting the potential of its population Kenya will remain impoverished. At the time of writing this thesis the Kenyan Government had no policy for increasing access to HE. This thesis focuses on tackling this dilemma by establishing a private university franchise operation in Kenya in partnership with London University utilising Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) and blended learning. The thesis utilises a case study of such a private HE college in Kenya in partnership with the University of London External Programme. I have been tasked with the management of the design, implementation and evaluation of the institution. The research field contains little assessment of the processes and outcomes of franchised HE in developing countries in Africa. The thesis aims to make a contribution to the research field in this regard. This thesis also looks at the process of creating a blended learning environment from initial problem analysis, through design and development, to implementation and evaluation. It draws on research literature and empirical work including interviews, diaries and questionnaires involving both staff and students. By outlining achievements, challenges, tensions and pitfalls it is hoped that the thesis can have a practical and professional significance and that insights can be drawn for HE institutions and policy makers in developing countries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Drew, Christopher N J"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":51515,"sim:weight":0.386343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.343035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Successful monomers were deposited onto suitable substrates (glass, gold, plastics, non-woven polypropylene) using continuous wave and pulse plasma, with the films characterised and low levels of active metal found in analysis using XPS and SIMS. Films were tested against solutions of pathogenic bacteria using a number of traditional and modern microbiological techniques and found to inhibit growth under a range of conditions, potentially due to the synergistic action of metal and ligand on bacterial cells. Effective control of bacteria was exhibited at times varying from 1h to 24h+. Highly volatile compounds were produced which allowed quick deposition of plasma films, which showed excellent activity against bacteria (99.9%+ growth reduction), indicating viability for potential application.

Its function in vivo is, however, unknown due to the lack of biocompatible inhibitors. Using a recently developed inhibitor, we explored the role of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate in autoreactive effector T cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the animal model for multiple sclerosis. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that calcium signalling controlled by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate is relevant for the pathogenic potential of autoimmune effector T cells. Live two photon imaging and molecular analyses revealed that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate signalling regulates T cell motility and re-activation upon arrival in the nervous tissues. Treatment with the nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate inhibitor significantly reduced both the number of stable arrests of effector T cells and their invasive capacity. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma and interleukin-17 were strongly diminished. Consecutively, the clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis were ameliorated. In vitro, antigen-triggered T cell proliferation and cytokine production were evenly suppressed. These inhibitory effects were reversible: after wash-out of the nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate antagonist, the effector T cells fully regained their functions. The nicotinic acid derivative BZ194 induced this transient state of non-responsiveness specifically in post-activated effector T cells. Naive and long-lived memory T cells, which express lower levels of the putative nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate receptor, type 1 ryanodine receptor, were not targeted. T cell priming and recall responses in vivo were not reduced. These data indicate that the nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate/calcium signalling pathway is essential for the recruitment and the activation of autoaggressive effector T cells within their target organ. Interference with this signalling pathway suppresses the formation of autoimmune inflammatory lesions and thus might qualify as a novel strategy for the treatment of T cell mediated autoimmune diseases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cordiglieri,  C.","Odoardi,  F.","Zhang,  B.","Nebel,  M.","Kawakami,  N.","Klinkert,  W.

The challenge to testing for nationality discrimination is\r\nthat the native/immigrant earnings gap will very likely also be influenced by productivity differences driven by incomplete\r\nassimilation of immigrants, as well as the possibility of racial or gender discrimination. There is relatively little empirical\r\nliterature, and virtually no theoretical literature, on this type of discrimination. In this study, a model of nationality\r\ndiscrimination where customer prejudice and native/immigrant productivity differences jointly influence the earnings gap is\r\npresented. We derive an extension of Becker’s Market Discrimination Coefficient (MDC), applied to the case of nationality\r\ndiscrimination when there are productivity differences. A number of novel implications are obtained. We find, for example,\r\nthat the MDC depends upon relative immigrant productivity and relative immigrant labor supply. We test the model on data\r\nfor hitters and pitchers in Major League Baseball, an industry with a history of immigration, potential for customer\r\ndiscrimination, and clean, detailed micro-data on worker productivities and race. OLS and decomposition methods are used\r\nto estimate the extent of discrimination.

While the benzene and ethane conversion decreased with time-on-stream for the PtH-ZSM-5(30) catalyst, the PtH-ZSM-5(80) catalyst demonstrated a stable performance. The deactivation of the PtH-ZSM-5(30) catalyst was found to be more significant, when compared to the PtH-ZSM-5(80) catalyst as a result of differences in the formation of coke. Results from gas sorption and x-ray diffraction experiments showed that coke is preferentially formed within the channel segments of the PtH-ZSM-5(30) catalyst as opposed to coke deposition on the outside surface of the PtH-ZSM-5(80) crystallites, subsequently blocking entrance to the zeolite channels. \r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThe location of the coke deposition was found to affect the product selectivity of the two PtH-ZSM-5 catalysts. The accessibility functions, derived from nitrogen and argon sorption data, suggested that, with prolonged time-on-stream, the coke molecules build up from the middle of the zeolite crystallites outwards towards the surface, as the reaction was carried out over the PtH-ZSM-5(30) catalyst. Partial blockage of the internal pore structure of the PtH-ZSM-5(30) catalyst decreased the diffusion length within the crystallites. In contrast to the typical effect of coking, where the selectivity of para- isomers would be enhanced with coke deposition, the effect of the reduction in the diffusion length of the PtH-ZSM-5(30) crystallites is consistent with the decreasing para-selectivity of the diethylbenzene (DEB) isomers with time-on-stream.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nn investigation of the causes of coke locations was conducted, and the results suggested that, the spatial distribution of Pt metal was responsible for the different locations of coke observed. Surface reactions initiated coking in the intercrystalline region of the PtH-ZSM-5(80) catalyst, as the Pt particles on the surface of the PtH-ZSM-5(80) crystallites increased the difficulty of access for reactants to the interior of the crystallites. Within the PtH-ZSM-5(30) catalyst, ethane dehydrogenation and benzene alkylation took place in the micropore network as a result of preferential intracrystalline deposition of Pt metal. Further conversions on the active sites within the PtH-ZSM-5(30) crystallites thus lead intracrystalline coking.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chua, Li M"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24646,"sim:weight":0.181187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60923,"sim:weight":0.138242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26540,"sim:weight":0.0767947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, many of these fail to meet expectations and/or bring about new less well understood problems. Hence, prior to developing further tools and methods it is first necessary to understand the reasons why such initiatives fail. This paper seeks to elicit the root causes of failed implementations and consider how these may be overcome. The paper begins by reviewing various paradigms for manufacturing systems improvement including design/redesign-, maintenance-, operator-, process-, product- and quality-led initiatives. In addition to examining the knowledge requirements of these approaches, the barriers to realising improvement are examined through consideration and review of literature from the fields of manufacturing, management and information systems. These fields are selected because of the considerable work that deals with process improvement, change management, information systems implementation and production systems. The review reveals the importance of fundamental understanding and highlights the lack of current methods for generating such understanding. To address this issue, the concept of machine-material interaction is introduced and a set of requirements for a supportive methodology to generate the fundamental understanding necessary to realise sustainable process improvement is developed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hicks, Ben J","Matthews, Jason"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":59232,"sim:weight":0.360011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108269,"sim:weight":0.267382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.247283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.246761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.241657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53666,"sim:weight":0.21706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59074,"sim:weight":0.181155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Crucial to the development of both these conditions is the interaction of S. aureus with endothelial cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the staphylococcal invasin FnBPA triggers bacterial invasion of endothelial cells via a process that involves fibronectin (Fn) bridging to alpha(5)beta(1) integrins. The Fn-binding region of FnBPA usually contains 11 non-identical repeats (FnBRs) with differing affinities for Fn, which facilitate the binding of multiple Fn molecules and may promote integrin clustering. We thus hypothesized that multiple repeats are necessary to trigger the invasion of endothelial cells by S. aureus. To test this we constructed variants of fnbA containing various combinations of FnBRs. In vitro assays revealed that endothelial cell invasion can be facilitated by a single high-affinity, but not low-affinity FnBR. Studies using a nisin-inducible system that controlled surface expression of FnBPA revealed that variants encoding fewer FnBRs required higher levels of surface expression to mediate invasion. High expression levels of FnBPA bearing a single low affinity FnBR bound Fn but did not invade, suggesting that FnBPA affinity for Fn is crucial for triggering internalization. In addition, multiple FnBRs increased the speed of internalization, as did higher expression levels of FnBPA, without altering the uptake mechanism. The relevance of these findings to pathogenesis was demonstrated using a murine sepsis model, which showed that multiple FnBRs were required for virulence. In conclusion, multiple FnBRs within FnBPA facilitate efficient Fn adhesion, trigger rapid bacterial uptake and are required for pathogenesis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edwards, Andrew M.","Potts,  J.

This includes business groups, a dominant organizational form in many emerging economies, competing with context-bound resources. When they wish to transcend their home context, they need internationally valuable resources, especially managerial resources, which may be quite different than the resources that enable domestic growth. This paper thus explores what resources drive this international growth in the case of Taiwanese business groups. Starting from Penrosian Theory, we focus on managerial resources that are shared across the member firms of a group, and thus shape the profile of the group. We find that international work experience favors internationalization while international education does not. Moreover, domestic institutional resources distract from internationalization, presumably because they are not transferable into other institutional contexts, and thus favor other types of growth.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tan,  D.

Research has therefore been undertaken to characterise the electrical properties of the sclera (charge, permselectivity, and isoelectric point (pI)) and to determine the basics of iontophoretic transport of model neutral, cationic, and anionic species (respectively, mannitol, timolol, and dexamethasone phosphate). Like the skin, the sclera supports a net negative charge under physiological pH conditions and has a pI between 3.5 and 4. Equally, the principles of trans-scleral iontophoretic transport of low molecular weight compounds are consistent with those observed for skin. Iontophoretic delivery of timolol and dexamethasone phosphate was proportional to applied current and drug concentration, and trans-scleral iontophoresis in rabbits led to enhanced intraocular levels of these compounds compared to passive delivery. The behaviour of higher molecular weight species such as peptide drugs and other biopharmaceuticals (e.g., proteins and oligonucleotides) has not been fully characterised. Further work has been undertaken, therefore, to examine the trans-scleral iontophoresis of vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic with a relatively high molecular weight of 1448 Da. It was indeed possible to deliver vancomycin by iontophoresis but trans-scleral transport did not increase linearly with either increasing current density or peptide concentration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Güngör, S","Delgado-Charro, M Begona","Ruiz-Perez, B","Schubert, W","Isom, P","Moslem, P","Patane, M A","Guy, Richard H"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5841784,"sim:weight":0.305282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573409,"sim:weight":0.221531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1581132,"sim:weight":0.158784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.113272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.107106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930758,"sim:weight":0.0919219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795349,"sim:weight":0.0814019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Framed within the narrative meta-paradigm, this research employs a qualitative, interpretive, social-constructionist perspective, and considers change in organizations as constituted by alterations in people’s understandings, encoded in narratives, and shared in conversations. The thesis draws on prior publications in the fields of narrative and organizational change, including the sensemaking, power and identity literatures. Data was co-created through sixty-six semi-structured interviews in a single, multi-site case study, augmented by informal observations and assessment of written materials. The research account tells the stories of: organizational change; the responses from members to change; and the shifts in power, control and autonomy. These narratives of change were prepared through an interpretive analysis of the interview transcripts, and the study provides a reflexive commentary on the research, through vignettes of the researcher’s experience. In the discussion, three readings interpret the case study from a narrative, an organizational change and an autoethnographic perspective. The primary contribution of the thesis is empirical, providing an in-depth case study that describes a complex organizational landscape, at two luxury hotels, into which a managerial initiative, Shine, was launched, and addresses the limited presence of narrative case studies on change. Through the application of existing theory to this empirical resource, the thesis contributes to understandings of sensemaking, power and identity during continuous change. The study argues for the significance of reflexivity in storytelling research, and the need for practitioners to embrace the socially constructed nature of ‘realities’ in working with organizational change. More generally, the thesis has demonstrated the value of a storytelling approach to understanding the complexities of organizational change, while identifying limitations to plurivocal storytelling as a research method.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbey, Graham P"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1585264,"sim:weight":0.408092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930363,"sim:weight":0.262863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.259828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.22861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654995,"sim:weight":0.203712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.200424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.185986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this case the traders have to decide firstly whether they want to submit a buy or sell order and then secondly what the limit price of this order is. In this thesis I develop further a theoretical model based on Chatterjee and Samuelson (1983) in which two traders trade with each other in a double auction market. Assuming that both traders assign a private value to the asset they are trading, which is known only to them but not their trading partner, I determine whether the traders should submit a buy or sell order and what the optimal limit price should be. I develop a single-period model in which traders only trade once and thus cannot learn each other’s private values from trading as well as a multi-period model that allows to infer to some degree the other trader’s private value from their order submission behavior.\r\nUsing this theoretical model as a benchmark, I then conducted experiments with students to evaluate whether the actual behavior of students fits the theory developed. Although we find that in general the behavior of traders is consistent with the proposed theory, there are some significant differences. Most notably traders seem to underreact to differences in their own private value, i.e. do not adjust their limit price to the extend suggested by theory. I evaluate these outcomes in light of results established results in behavioral finance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Li, Honghong"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23315,"sim:weight":0.436172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512520,"sim:weight":0.376891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66947,"sim:weight":0.355731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.247838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85602,"sim:weight":0.220605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108511,"sim:weight":0.191382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One strategy to increase yield is to increase seed size. However in nature, due to the limited resources of the mother plant, an enlarged seed size is often associated with a concomitant reduction in seed number. Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a biotechnological approach to increase seed size through the modification of the triploid endosperm or the ovule integuments was shown to be a viable strategy to improve seed yield. Targeted over-expression of the ANT transcription factor specifically within the endosperm significantly increased seed size without negative effects on fertility. Overcoming compromised fertility in arf2 mutants established that ARF2 and the integuments are important factors in determining seed size and yield. To ensure agronomic relevance, both the gross yield and the harvest index (HI, ratio of seed yield to biological yield) were used to assess the impact of traits, such as increased integument size, introduced into Arabidopsis. To uncover novel regulators of seed size and further develop the current understanding of seed development, second-site mutations were induced in the auxin response factor 2 (arf2) mutant, which produces large seeds due to extra cell division in the ovule integuments. The ARABIDOPSIS CRINKLY 4 (ACR4) gene was identified as a suppressor of the arf2 seed phenotype. In arf2-8 acr4 double mutants, an additive effect on cell proliferation was observed, indicating that ACR4 affects the seed coat through a developmental pathway independent of ARF2. Natural variation present in Arabidopsis was used to study seed yield and its components. Considerable variation in seed size, yield and HI was revealed. Significantly, high seed weight was not associated with high yield or high HI. In contrast, high seed number and reduced plant stature were revealed as important components of high yield and yield efficiency. Additionally, ERECTA was identified as a potential ‘Green Revolution’ gene. Seed size in Arabidopsis was shown to be an extremely plastic trait in response to alterations in the post-flowering source-sink ratio, increasing by 35.0 – 66.2% in the ecotypes tested. Furthermore, a difference in seed weight between restricted (high source-sink ratio) and unrestricted (low source-sink ratio) pollinations was first observed remarkably early in seed development. However, reducing seed number by restricting pollination did not substantially alter integument or endosperm development in order to facilitate increased nutrient uptake.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hughes, Rhiannon"],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.237504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.237504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.190028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316337,"sim:weight":0.162244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24544,"sim:weight":0.136944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26919,"sim:weight":0.134995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.124399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The objective of this study was to examine diurnal functioning of the HPA axis in patients with clinically defined non-inflammatory chronic pain syndrome (CPS) compared to controls. The sample consisted of 37 adults with CPS and 47 healthy controls. All participants provided saliva samples at awakening, 12: 00, 18: 00 and 21: 00 h on two consecutive days, as well as completing self-report questionnaires relating to anxiety and depression. The CPS group had a significantly lower overall mean diurnal salivary cortisol concentration compared to the control group (p \u003c 0.01) but no significant differences were found between the two groups for repeated cortisol sampling across the day. However, a three-way interaction of time of day by patient status by sex was found (p \u003c 0.032), with lower cortisol concentration in male patients compared to female patients in the afternoon period. No significant group effect was found for the rate of decline in the circadian rise in cortisol concentration. These data demonstrate that CPS is associated with a degree of hypocortisolemia, particularly in male patients. The altered dynamics of cortisol secretion in CPS in relation to the onset and duration of pain in patients remains to be determined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner-Cobb, Julie M.","Osborn,  M.","da Silva,  L.","Keogh, Edmund","Jessop,  D.

Concerns have continually been raised however about the quality of the service provided. This is the focus of this study. This topic was explored and evaluated through the use of three units of analysis using a qualitative case study of the Mona campus. The methods used to gather data were essentially qualitative, using interviews, focus groups, and documentary research. The theoretical orientation was grounded in the quality literature, drawing on both the industrial literature as well as that in higher education. My findings paved the way for judgments which indicated that various quality procedures are employed in different parts of the UWI, Mona Campus. Some of these procedures do not seem to have produced the overall quality culture of excellence which was intended. Out of the information and commentaries produced by the respondents a unified quality framework has been produced that pays attention to effective procedures, processes, and systems.

Design/methodology/approach - The extent to which buyers display an awareness of, and willingness to respond positively to, supplier needs, wants and preferences - termed supplier empathy and how this influences their attitude towards buyer-supplier cooperation and support of relational exchange is empirically assessed. In addition, factors that may influence levels of supplier empathy and the effect of supplier empathy on the incidence of supplier problems are examined. Finally, the extent to which social acceptability bias may mask attitudes in areas where consensus exists is considered. An empirical study utilising survey data from members of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply in the UK was completed. A total of 421 useable responses were received and analysed to evaluate hypotheses. The design also included efforts to identify the presence, and minimise the effects, of social acceptability bias. Findings - The analysis indicates that the partial consensus surrounding the relational exchange approach is not shared by all practitioners. In addition, it is found that the level of supplier empathy exhibited by respondents is significantly influenced by supplier-dependence aversion, innovation focus, extent of co-design activity, existence of explicit partnership/cooperation objectives, and support for long-term trading relationships. Originality/value - The paper presents evidence that despite a significant but partial cooperation consensus in the academic literature, many large company practitioners appear unconvinced of the benefits of cooperation. Most analyses of buyer attitudes and behaviours are conducted by marketing researchers seeking to assist organisations-as-suppliers.

Early e-procurement literature forecast significant improvements in procurement costs, an improving status of the purchasing function, and changes to the structure of supply markets. Our study seeks to evaluate the validity of these forecasts through the development of a structural model of the ‘e-procurement effect’. This model is intended to define the dynamics of the e-procurement process in an organization and provide a foundation for a research stream into the transformational effect of e-procurement deployment. The article presents the evaluation of e-procurement implementation and operation from an 18-month study of e-procurement deployment across nine UK public sector organizations. The article explores five key themes in e-procurement, namely system specification, implementation management, changes to organizational characteristics, changes in total acquisition costs, and changes to governance structures. Our analysis suggests that the proposed structural model of the e-procurement effect is broadly applicable and that many of the previous claimed benefits in the literature can be realized. We also contend that an important variable for the success of e-procurement adoption is to address the internal service quality attributes of e-procurement processes—a topic which offers significant scope for future research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Croom, S","Brandon-Jones, Alistair"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108518,"sim:weight":0.386388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.210064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59232,"sim:weight":0.153605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.150602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652986,"sim:weight":0.146603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53666,"sim:weight":0.136878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

RepRap is an open-source project to produce a rapid prototyping machine which can manufacture its own parts using the FFF process. This thesis focuses on the mechanical design of the ‘RepRap printer’ and documents how it was conceived, developed, tested, and finally used to make a set of its own parts. Self-manufacture was demonstrated by assembling this set of parts into a working copy of the original machine. The child machine went on to demonstrate replication without degeneracy by successfully manufacturing one of its own parts. A part count analysis of the child machine, not including the fasteners it needed in its early development phase, identified a self-manufacturing ratio of 48%. This proportion is relatively low because the design adopts modularity and redundancy principles to encourage development. Should the machine’s design be adapted to fully demonstrate self-manufacture, this ratio could rise to 67% in the near future. To increase the ratio further, the machine needs three new tool heads to print resin, conductive alloy, and flexible polymer. These developments are achievable in the mid-future and could increase the self manufactured parts ratio to 94%. As this machine is the first version of the RepRap printer, these results are encouraging. Parts which the RepRap printer is unlikely to make until the far-future include some of the electronic components, motors, conductive cable, solenoids and a heating element. However, a 94% self-manufacturing ratio will qualify it as an assisted self-replicating machine. As with natural self-reproducing organisms, the printer will benefit from geometric growth and evolution. The author discusses how, by trading power, computing, feedstock and assembly for manufacturing capability with human beings, the RepRap printer may become a household item, offering a radical alternative to the way our society manufactures and consumes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sells, Edward A"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Micro-generators have the potential to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and enhance energy security by providing heat or electricity from either renewable sources, or via the more efficient use of fossil fuels. But this potential is often unquantified or unclear, and hence quantitative information is required concerning both the energetic performance of micro-generators and their ability to provide net reductions in carbon emissions.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nIn the context of household energy provision in the UK, thermodynamic and related carbon analyses of three micro-generation technologies have been carried out. These studies contribute to the research of the SUPERGEN ‘Highly Distributed Power Systems’ Consortium, which has been addressing a broad range of issues regarding micro-generation. The technologies analysed here are a grid-tied micro-wind turbine (rotor diameter 1.7m, rated power 600 W at 12 m/s), a grid-tied solar photovoltaic array (15 m2,\r\n2.1 kWp mono-crystalline silicon), and a solar hot-water system (2.8 m2 flat-plate collector, direct-feed system). Annual energy outputs were estimated and contextualised against the demands of representative UK households. The overall energy-resource and carbon savings provided by the micro-generators were assessed on the basis that they (partially) displace the established supply systems. Savings were then compared with the energy-resource and carbon ‘debts’ of the micro-generators to determine their net performance.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThe displaced energy or carbon payback periods of the micro-generators were estimated to be well within their estimated lifetimes: a maximum 2.5 years for the SHW system, 3.1 years for the micro-wind turbine installed in an ‘open’ environment, and 7.4 years for the solar PV system. After payback, net energy-resource and carbon savings accrue. This thesis thus demonstrates that, given appropriate UK installations, all three micro-generators can reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy security by reducing use of, and dependence upon, fossil fuels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allen, Stephen R"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Countries reduce taxation to attract firms in order to create employment and economic development. Firms locate their investments where the net return on capital is higher due to a lower tax burden. But tax competition is not optimal because the lowering of the tax burden causes an inefficient allocation of capital and provision of public goods. Thus, it requires coordination of tax policies in an economic area such as the European Union (EU).\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nDespite data not showing a complete “race to the bottom” in tax rates, the predictions of the model are widely believed by businessman and the public opinion. But tax competition has been exclusively based on neoclassical theory where imperfect decisions by managers and certain features of the decision making process such as uncertainty are assumed to be not essential. The same applies when considering incompatibility with FDI theory.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nA complementary approach, based on the Heiner model, underlines the central role of uncertainty and the relevance of cognitive characteristics in managers´ FDI decisions.

Furthermore, location decisions are shown to be significantly explained by heuristics and biases arising from the uncertainty faced by managers.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nBut the role of taxation in these decisions appears less significant than is usually considered. From a sample of 112 Portuguese FDI operations only 4 are explained by fiscal variables.

Frequency plots were also generated to show which wrist\r\npositions were most commonly used during the tasks.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nQualitative and quantitative methods were used to reduce the original task list to\r\njust four tasks which represented a wide range of aspects of wrist motion, including large mean ranges of motion and mean locations that were displaced away from the neutral wrist position.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThese four short-listed tasks (holding a frying pan, turning a key in a lock, holding a glass of water and buttoning a shirt) could all be carried out whilst\r\nseated, with little reliance on other physiological joints and with low-cost props.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThe overall approach described in this thesis could be refined into a useful\r\nclinical tool, either for identifying motion impairments tracking individual patients’\r\nprogress.

Ennals and Murphy (2005) suggest that escape from the poverty trap is more likely for those who remain in education after the age of 16. However, school life may bring problems for children from low income families, with learning assuming a lower priority than social acceptance (Ridge, 2005). This article argues that young people in poverty are also less likely to participate in other learning activities. The nature of learning in out-of-school-time settings is explored and the distinctive features of the educational relationships that underpin out-of-school-time learning are discussed. We conclude that children from disadvantaged backgrounds who have acquired an understanding of educational relationships are more likely to develop positive attitudes to learning. Strategies to redress the added disadvantage that non-participation in leisure activities creates for young people in low income families are suggested.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bullock, K.","Muschamp, Yolande","Ridge, Tess","Wikeley, Felicity"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.35344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57174,"sim:weight":0.253547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Iron is an essential nutrient and bacteria have different mechanisms for obtaining both the ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+) forms of this metal from their environments. In this study we were interested in analyzing the role of Fe3+ and Fe2+ iron uptake systems in the ability of Photorhabdus to interact with its invertebrate hosts.\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\u003cp\u003eResults: We constructed targeted deletion mutants of exbD, feoABC and yfeABCD in P. luminescens TT01. The exbD mutant was predicted to be crippled in its ability to obtain Fe3+ and we show that this mutant does not grow well in iron-limited media. We also show that this mutant was avirulent to the insect but was unaffected in its symbiotic interaction with Heterorhabditis. Furthermore we show that a mutation in feoABC (encoding a predicted Fe2+ permease) was unaffected in both virulence and symbiosis whilst the divalent cation transporter encoded by yfeABCD is required for virulence in the Tobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera) but not in the Greater Wax Moth, Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera).

Moreover this study also reveals that the Yfe transporter appears to be involved in Mn2+-uptake during growth in the gut lumen of the IJ nematode. Therefore, the Yfe transporter in P. luminescens TT01 is important during colonization of both the insect and nematode and, moreover, the metal ion transported by this pathway is host-dependent.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Watson, Robert J.","Millichap, Peter","Joyce, S.

{"identifier":2807271,"ep:Repository":82,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Investigating the role of the imprinted Grb10 gene in the regulation of maternal nutrient transfer","bibo:abstract":"Imprinted genes are a subset of loci, positioned on autosomes and the X-chromosome, which are expressed monoallelically in a parent-of-origin specific manner. The influence of such genes on the regulation of embryonic growth and postnatal energy homeostasis is well established. The parental conflict hypothesis predicts that, in utero, paternally-expressed genes will promote maternal resource acquisition and thus growth, whereas maternally-expressed genes will oppose this action, restricting resource investment in a single brood in the interests of the lifetime reproductive success of the mother. Grb10 is an imprinted gene which encodes the cytoplasmic adaptor protein Growth factor receptor bound protein 10. In the majority of tissues, Grb10 is expressed from the maternally-derived chromosome. Consistent with conflict theory, transgenic mice inheriting a disrupted Grb10 allele through the maternal line (Grb10Δ2-4m/+) exhibit embryonic overgrowth, although the mechanisms and signalling pathways responsible for this effect are unclear. Grb10Δ2-4m/+ mice also demonstrate enhanced insulin signalling and improved whole body glucose clearance, consistent with the established role of imprinted genes in the regulation of postnatal metabolism. An integrated LacZ gene-trap in the Grb10Δ2-4 allele failed to fully recapitulate endogenous Grb10 expression, notably within the central nervous system. To address this issue, a second transgenic mouse line, Grb10KO, was created. This allele produced strong LacZ reporter expression in the central nervous system, but only when transmitted through the paternal line (Grb10KO+/p), establishing Grb10 as the only known imprinted gene with a reciprocal imprinting profile between the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Grb10KO+/p mice exhibit a social dominance phenotype, suggesting distinct roles for maternally- and paternally-expressed Grb10, consistent with their respective sites of expression. The current study characterised the Grb10KO allele at the genetic level, and in doing so, revealed a phenotypic difference between Grb10KOm/p and Grb10Δ2-4m/p mice for which a possible explanation was provided. Importantly, with this knowledge, the current study elucidated the genetic and molecular basis for inconsistencies in reporter expression between the two transgenic lines, identifying a novel tissue-specific enhancer element at the locus. In addition to the central nervous system, this enhancer appeared to be active in the mammary epithelium, identifying a novel site of Grb10 expression, which was pregnancy-dependent and specifically from the maternally-inherited chromosome. Characterisation of the functional significance of expression in this tissue revealed that maternally-expressed Grb10 mediates a supply/demand system between lactating mother and suckling pup, acting as a supply promoter and demand suppressor. This role is inconsistent with conflict theory, but suggests the maintenance of the Grb10 imprint in the mammary epithelium might be associated with improved coadaptiveness between mother and offspring. Intriguingly, in utero, Grb10 is both a demand and supply suppressor. When considered together, these findings suggest a wider role for maternally-expressed Grb10 in the homeostatic control of growth and achievement of optimal fitness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cowley, Michael Anthony"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26719,"sim:weight":0.221199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.165504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.164991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25906,"sim:weight":0.159382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.136317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As a result the use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly building materials and techniques is increasing. Straw bale construction is one such technique. ModCell panels are an innovative way of using straw bales in a prefabricated wall system. As ModCell panels are prefabricated the normal risks associated with straw bale construction (fire, straw getting wet during construction, unfamiliar material) are removed from the building site. The panels consist of a timber frame, braced with steel rods, in-filled with straw bales and the surfaces are then rendered with a lime render. To date ModCell panels have been used for cladding on framed buildings. However, they are now being developed for low rise domestic load-bearing applications and in order to achieve this sufficient racking shear resistance is required. Previous testing has shown that the corner joints in the panel’s timber frame are a weak point.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis first aim of this thesis is to improve the racking shear resistance of ModCell panels through a series of experimental laboratory based tests so that they can be used for load-bearing applications. This thesis also aims to develop a computer model of load-bearing ModCell panels in order to further understand their structural behaviour and assist with future design and development. Different designs of frame corner joints were tested in order to find the most suitable type of joint. Screw connected joints proved to be the strongest and were twice as stiff as the other joint designs tested. Full scale panel racking shear tests were undertaken to assess the overall performance of the panels when using the screw connected joints and establish if they are suitable for load-bearing construction. Both solid panels and panels with window openings were tested. Two types of bracing were used in the test panels, either corner bracing or cross bracing. The corner braced panels were over twice as stiff as panels tested during a previous research project. The corner braced panels were also stiffer than the cross braced panels at the serviceability deflection limit of the panels height/500, and was sufficiently stiff to resist the required in plane loading under serviceability conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe computer model was developed alongside the structural testing. The model was developed using the Robot Millennium software package and modelled all elements of the panels apart from the straw. It was verified against the laboratory test results and found to be accurate within the serviceability deflection limit of height/500. Once material failure occurred in the actual panels the model’s accuracy was reduced as it does not include material failure criteria. The model was then used to undertake a parametric analysis. From this analysis it was found that all the elements modelled have an effect on the stiffness of ModCell panels. Changing the render thickness was found to make the greatest difference on the overall stiffness of the panels. Gusset plate and glued and screwed joint designs were also modelled to find their effect on panel stiffness. From all of the results of this analysis an improved panel was designed and when modelled was 20% stiffer than the original panel.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Gross, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In particular, it will be shown that the indicators related to the education status of children are insufficiently disaggregated to enable an improved understanding of the characteristics of children that continue to be excluded. From this analysis it will be argued that a broader list of indicators needs to be developed related to the dynamics at the level of the school, community and household. However, given that social exclusion may be structured differently in various contexts it is argued that participatory research is required that facilitates the assessment and analysis of these dynamics by all the key stakeholders, including children, at the various levels. In particular, policy makers fail to involve children in the process of assessing and analyzing the reasons for exclusion, and therefore do not benefit from their perceptions and insights. Further analysis of the various dynamics which relate to exclusion provide useful insights to better understand the policy and programmatic initiatives that effectively address the social exclusion of children from primary school.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Jenkins, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.436813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.386996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53524,"sim:weight":0.293237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.269157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5629,"sim:weight":0.259661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

CXCL11 has also been reported to bind to an additional receptor, namely CXCR7, which also interacts with CXCL12. Two alternatively spliced variants of the human CXCR3 receptor have been described, namely CXCR3-B and CXCR3-alt. The human CXCR3-B has been found to bind CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 as well as an additional agonist CXCL4/PF4. In contrast, CXCR3-alt only binds CXCL11. This work demonstrates that CXCL4 like the original CXCR3 agonists is capable of inducing biochemical signalling, namely intra-cellular calcium elevation, and activation of p44/p42 MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways in activated human T lymphocytes. Phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK and Akt was inhibited by pertussis toxin, suggesting coupling to Gi protein. In contrast CXCR3 antagonists blocked CXCR3 agonists but not CXCL4-mediated responses. Surprisingly, stimulation of T cells with CXCL4 failed to elicit migratory responses of these cells and did not lead to loss of surface CXCR3 expression. Collectively our evidence shows that although CXCL4 is coupled to downstream biochemical machinery, its function in T cells is distinct from the function of CXCR3 agonists. The work presented in this thesis also indicates that despite considerably lower surface expression in comparison to the full length CXCR3, CXCR3-B and CXCR3-alt transduce biochemical signals in response to CXCL11 in transfected cells. According to previous reports the role of CXCR7 in signalling and chemotaxis in T cells could not be detected. In T cells and transfected cells system CXCR7 was localised at the plasma membrane and was efficiently internalized in response to CXCL11 and CXCL12. Studies of the involvement of methylation in T cell chemotaxis suggest that this modification may be required in this process as it was partially inhibited by methylation inhibitor- MTA. Moreover T cell co-stimulation caused increased levels of arginine mono-methylated proteins suggesting the importance of methylation in T lymphocyte signalling.","bibo:AuthorList":["Korniejewska, Anna"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2807550,"sim:weight":0.783667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.1299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.11255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.104052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0911869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of these applications is the analysis of sixteen strains of one of the bacterial species that cause Lyme disease. Results from that analysis have helped understanding the evolutionary paths of these bacterial strains and, therefore, the dynamics of the spread of Lyme disease.

The Bragg diffraction of optical waves occurring within the acoustic waves in the proposed structure are simulated as a two-dimensional interaction between two guided optical modes and an acoustic surface wave.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThe modal distributions and propagation velocities of SAWs in a multilayer system are calculated using Adler’s matrix method. The electrical characteristics of an IDT, such as impedance, insertion loss, electromechanical constant and so on are also discussed.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nTransverse and lateral optical modes in the given multilayer structure are analyzed by the transfer matrix method. The interaction of optical waves and acoustic waves are modeled using the rigorous grating diffraction theory. Starting from Floquet’s theory, the well-known coupled-wave method and modal method can both be derived from the rigorous grating diffraction theory. Discussions of some useful approximate methods are also presented. In this thesis, the simulations of the acoustooptic interaction are performed using the coupled-wave method.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nFrom the simulation results, the angular distribution profile and spatial profile of the output of the FISOS are evaluated. An improvement to the expression of the diffraction efficiency in such an integrated device is proposed. The so-called beam diffraction efficiency gives a more complete measure to the acoustooptic diffraction and is used to investigate the features of FISOS different from conventional acoustooptic devices. Contour plots of the beam efficiency varying with acoustic frequency and power in a FISOS is demonstrated to be a convenient and powerful approach in the device design.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThe operational performances of an integrated deflector and a modulator in FISOS are analyzed to investigate the feasibility of FISOS. The trade-off of the efficiency-resolution in an integrated deflector design is discussed. Short interaction length, high acoustic frequency and narrow ridge are proved to be helpful for a larger number of resolvable spots with a fairly high efficiency. In the case of the integrated modulator, given that the figure of merit Q is fixed, it is demonstrated that the smaller the Q, the longer the interaction length, larger ridge width and lower acoustic frequency will give rise to a larger bandwidth, though the highest efficiency might appear at a higher frequency.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nSome practical issues such as the misalignment of planar elements on the device and the incoherence of the integrated optical source are also discussed. A modified working frequency can be used to compensate the efficiency loss in the former case; in the latter case, it is demonstrated that a distortion of beam diffraction efficiency versus acoustic power with an incoherent optical source arises due to the wide spectrum of the incident optical waves.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meng, Qingbin"],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.357611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.347545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26743,"sim:weight":0.325268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54114,"sim:weight":0.311552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268391,"sim:weight":0.29923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109196,"sim:weight":0.29468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22901,"sim:weight":0.291455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23394,"sim:weight":0.28181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.265506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28907,"sim:weight":0.230327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26656,"sim:weight":0.217261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28584,"sim:weight":0.196837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The thesis contributes to an emerging debate that examines the combination of contractual and relational governance in inter-organisational exchanges. Contractual and relational governance mechanisms have been positioned as precluding mechanisms, which may result in destructive effects if combined for governing inter-organisational relationships. Previous research studies have increasingly acknowledged that the use of contractual mechanisms does not exclude the use of relational mechanisms and vice-versa. However, the recent literature offers limited insights into the dynamic interaction of both inter-organisational governance mechanisms and their impact on overall performance. The analysis in this research utilises a conceptual framework and a number of theoretical lenses through which the dynamic interplay of contractual and relational governance mechanisms is explained. Based on empirical case analysis of six public-private supply arrangements across three sectors: healthcare, waste management and emergency services, the research explores the dynamic interplay of both governance mechanisms and their impact on overall performance. Retrospective case study data was collected deploying semi-structured interviews and the critical incident technique was used to investigate the governance interplay over time. The contribution to knowledge is a conceptual framework that refines contractual and relational governance components in supply relationships over time. The findings indicate the importance of the interplay between inter-personal and inter-organisational trust in combination with complex contracts and intermediate contractual agreements. From this the conclusion is drawn that organisations entering into long-term supply relationships need to deploy both contractual and relational governance mechanisms in combination in order to achieve better overall performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roehrich, Jens Kurt"],"dc:date":"2009-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to investigate the impact of a single bout of exercise either of moderate (40% O2max) or high (70% O2max) intensity on post-exercise energy intake, physical activity energy expenditure and energy balance hormones in both sedentary and active males. Physical activity energy expenditure increased between 38 and 62 hours following moderate intensity exercise in sedentary males (Chapters 3 and 4). This was due to increased light intensity energy expenditure (2.4-4.79 METs) such as standing and walking activities (Chapter 4). The Change in PAEE was not associated with circulating leptin and adiponectin concentrations. There was no impact of a single bout of exercise on post-exercise energy intake in sedentary males during a buffet meal (Chapter 4). Chapter 5 aimed to determine whether changes in PAEE, energy intake, and energy balance hormones were related to physical activity status. Interestingly, plasma acylated ghrelin concentration was suppressed while total peptide YY (PYY) concentration tended to be elevated after high intensity exercise in active males (Chapter 5). However, there was no impact of either moderate or high intensity exercise on PAEE and post-exercise energy intake in active males. The final study (Chapter 6) determined whether high intensity exercise in the fed state after a few days of food restriction had an impact on circulating energy balance hormones. Circulating postprandial total PYY and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were increased for one hour after high intensity exercise in active men. There was no change in PAEE and post-exercise energy intake after exercise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Silalertdetkul, Supaporn"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.287896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.276578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.248794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.191339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.166512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929904,"sim:weight":0.160078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23821,"sim:weight":0.127602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108088,"sim:weight":0.0922905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.0856073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In phase one, participants were recruited from 4 local branches of the Alzheimer’s Society in the southwest to take part in a single focus group or interview. In total 5 people with dementia and 23 carers participated. The aim was to explore perceptions of medicines on day-to-day life. Findings fell into 3 superordinate themes: On Being a Carer; Interacting with Healthcare Professionals and Living with a Degenerative Illness. Participants described great variability in access to medicines and in outcomes of consultations with healthcare professionals. Ageism and therapeutic nihilism were commonly encountered. Phase Two was a longitudinal study exploring the impact of medicines for dementia in early stage disease using a case study approach. Seven case studies were recruited via memory clinics; with four receiving a medicine for dementia and three not. Case study participants were followed over a 13-month period. The superordinate themes were: Living with a Memory Problem or Dementia; Interacting with Healthcare Professionals and Medicines for Dementia. Even in the early stages of a dementia spousal relationships were negatively affected. Medicines for dementia enabled renegotiation of spousal relationships and adjustment and acceptance to take place. The Mini-Mental State Examination was perceived to tell only half the story and was insensitive to improvements in alertness, initiative, engagement with the individuals’ lifeworld and ability to maintain and engage in social relationships. Overall both phases found access to medicines for dementia a complicated and long procedure. The methods for assessing response were perceived as threatening and unrealistic. There was a perceived need for greater education about dementia and its treatment for healthcare professionals, people with dementia and their carers. It was identified that pharmacists could take a more proactive role in providing a pharmaceutical care service.","bibo:AuthorList":["Taylor, Denise Ann"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":68602,"sim:weight":0.515063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103807,"sim:weight":0.36173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.261176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.23535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.222685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929976,"sim:weight":0.189134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108702,"sim:weight":0.184181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.178551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.171243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.1617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70031,"sim:weight":0.141224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Black (1976) observed, “The harder we look at the dividend picture, the more it seems like a puzzle, with pieces that just don’t fit together.”\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThis thesis aims to shed additional light on the dividend puzzle. Accordingly, two theoretical models have been developed to help explain why firms pay dividends or repurchase their own shares. The models consider the case in which the managers of a high-quality firm (firm H) and a low-quality firm (firm L) choose to use corporate cash flows to pay dividends, repurchase shares, or invest in a real project from which they can earn private benefits. I focus on the case in which firm H has a positive NPV project whereas firm L has a negative NPV project.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nIn the first model, developed in spirit of Isagawa (2000), I show that paying dividends is a dominated strategy for firm H, regardless of the managerial weight parameter. If the manager is myopic, firm L will choose to repurchase shares at the detriment of existing shareholders. If the manager is farsighted, on the other hand, firm L will choose to pay dividends. I also consider the case in which investors are irrational in that they do not update their beliefs upon observing one firm repurchasing shares while the other firm paying dividends. The model shows that, in inefficient market, firm L will not mimic given that firm H repurchases shares since it cannot obtain any benefit from doing so.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nIn the second model, built on Fairchild and Zhang’s (2005) work, in which the managerial payout decisions depend on the relative magnitudes of dividend and repurchase catering premia, I demonstrate that a myopic manager of firm H may pass up a positive NPV project in order to cater to investor demand for dividends or share repurchases (an adverse selection problem). In addition, I show that the agency cost of free cash flow can be mitigated if the dividend-catering premium is sufficiently high. That is, firm L’s manager will have a strong incentive to return excess cash to shareholders rather than invest it in a negative NPV project.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThen, I investigate dividend changes in Thailand over the period 2002-2005. To test the signalling and free cash flow hypotheses, I first analyse profitability changes around dividend changes and benchmark them with control firms, and examine the relation between dividend changes and the past and future profitability. Consistent with Benartzi et al.’s (1997) evidence in the U.S., dividend changes in Thailand do not signal future profitability but rather the past performance. Then, I examine the determinants of dividend changes and firm’s decision to change dividends. I also investigate the short-run and long-run stock price performance of dividend-changing firms, and the relation between announcement returns and hypothesised independent variables. Finally, I examine firms’ investment behaviour following dividend changes. The results do not support the view that dividend changes signal future profitability. Overall, the findings are broadly consistent with the free cash flow hypothesis rather than the signalling hypothesis.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nAdditionally, I provide preliminary evidence on open-market share repurchases (OMRs) in Thailand over the period December 2001 to January 2007. I find that stock prices react positively to OMR announcements and continue to increase in the longer term, suggesting that stock market underreacts to the signal conveyed by the managers of repurchasing firms. Comparing the actual repurchase cost with the costs of benchmark portfolios, I find that the actual repurchase cost is the lowest. This finding suggests that the managers of repurchasing firms have substantial ability to time the market.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thanatawee, Yordying"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85844,"sim:weight":0.570822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316064,"sim:weight":0.286455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108576,"sim:weight":0.246533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85771,"sim:weight":0.243936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84866,"sim:weight":0.240553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15237,"sim:weight":0.239108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85519,"sim:weight":0.233762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.232935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108482,"sim:weight":0.227335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108968,"sim:weight":0.215988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85602,"sim:weight":0.199854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109104,"sim:weight":0.195211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734394,"sim:weight":0.188362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448022,"sim:weight":0.186276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85650,"sim:weight":0.180594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85424,"sim:weight":0.169594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Therefore, hardware in the loop (HIL) testing techniques are increasingly being adopted to develop electronic control units (ECU) for engine and other components of a vehicle. In this thesis, HIL testing system is developed to provide a laboratory testing environment for continuously variable transmissions (CVTs). Two induction motors were utilized to emulate a real engine and vehicle. The engine and vehicle models, running in real-time, provide reference torque and speed signals for input and output dynamometers, respectively. To design torque and speed tracking controllers, linear models of the motor and drive systems were firstly identified from the test results. Feedforward controllers were then designed according to the inverse dynamics of the identified models. Because of the existence of unstable zeros in the model, design effort was focused on the stability and causality of the inverse process. Digital preview filters were formulated to approximate the stable inverse of unstable zeros as part of the feedforward controller. Normally, future information of input trajectory is required when implementing the digital preview filters, which makes the feedforward controller non-causal. Since the engine and vehicle model require current information to calculate the next output and no future value can be provided in advance, the application of non-causal digital controllers was limited. A novel method is proposed here to apply non-causal digital controllers causally. Robustness of the controllers is also considered when the two motors are coupled and the gear ratio between them was changed. The proposed coupled control method was tested and verified experimentally by using a manual gearbox before recommending its use for a CVT testing. A multifrequency test signal as well as simulation results of a whole vehicle model were used as torque and speed demand signals in the experiments. A HIL testing case was also presented. Frequency and time domain results showed the effectiveness of the method under both testing procedures to fully compensate for the dynamics of both actuators.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Pengfei"],"dc:date":"2009-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":33709,"sim:weight":0.270243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51544,"sim:weight":0.256258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59004,"sim:weight":0.240959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27244,"sim:weight":0.231902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26739,"sim:weight":0.231394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57236,"sim:weight":0.225111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86028,"sim:weight":0.223731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108820,"sim:weight":0.218103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512829,"sim:weight":0.214649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932481,"sim:weight":0.20624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This thesis describes studies of terahertz surface plasmon polariton (SPP) guidance on a range of metamaterial structures using TTDS. Metamaterials are artificial media constructed from sub-wavelength dimension conducting elements which have an electromagnetic response that can be engineered by creating geometrical plasma-like resonances. In this work, high-confinement terahertz waveguiding is achieved by binding SPPs to cavity resonances which spoof the behaviour of intrinsic surface plasmon resonances found at much higher frequencies. The main aim of these studies is to investigate their properties with regard to potential applications in waveguiding and sensing. The first two chapters of this thesis describe the background to the subject. In chapter 3, the construction of a novel, flexible geometry, fibre-coupled TTDS system using hollow-core photonic crystal fibre (HC-PCF) is described. The extension of the system to include a near-field probe for evanescent field characterisation is also discussed. In chapter 4, we present the first direct observation of terahertz SPP propagation on plasmonic metamaterials consisting of copper sheets patterned with two-dimensional arrays of square copper-lined holes. Wavelength-scale field confinement is experimentally observed over an octave in frequency close to the band edge, representing a two order of magnitude increase in confinement compared to a flat metal sheet. In chapter 5, metamaterials consisting of two-dimensional arrays of coaxial apertures are shown to support two spoof plasmon modes below the band edge, enabling wavelength-scale field confinement to be experimentally realised at two distinct frequencies. In chapter 6, we present the first experimental results for terahertz SPP propagation on helical and discretely grooved cylindrical metamaterials termed metawires. In each case the results are compared with numerical simulations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2009-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":268952,"sim:weight":0.353732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1560942,"sim:weight":0.232206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584826,"sim:weight":0.2307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109196,"sim:weight":0.230052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448001,"sim:weight":0.222805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26191,"sim:weight":0.211147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23197,"sim:weight":0.205858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.186415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26735,"sim:weight":0.170303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.162325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28584,"sim:weight":0.160268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.157778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269537,"sim:weight":0.156211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26656,"sim:weight":0.152771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22901,"sim:weight":0.127145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.122362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In addition an integrated scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) or atomic force microscope (AFM) tip allows the simultaneous measurement of the sample topography, which can then be correlated with magnetic images. SHPM has several advantages over alternative methods; it is almost completely non-invasive, can be used over a very wide range of temperatures (0.3-300 K) and magnetic fields (0-7 T) and yields quantitative maps of the z-component of magnetic induction. The approach is particularly well suited to low temperature imaging of vortices in type II superconductors with very high signal:noise ratios and relatively high spatial resolution (100 nm). This paper will introduce the design principles of SHPM including the choice of semiconductor heterostructure for different measurement conditions as well as surface tracking and scanning mechanisms. The full potential of the technique will be illustrated with results of vortex imaging studies of three distinct superconducting systems: (i) vortex chains in the \"crossing lattices\" regime of highly anisotropic cuprate superconductors, (ii) vortex-antivortex pairs spontaneously nucleated in ferromagnetic-superconductor hybrid structures, and (iii) vortices in the exotic p-wave superconductor Sr2RuO4 at milliKelvin temperatures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bending, Simon J."],"dc:date":"2010-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2809801,"sim:weight":0.45239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2813371,"sim:weight":0.449084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27592,"sim:weight":0.356914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28947,"sim:weight":0.311236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9733,"sim:weight":0.237754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108050,"sim:weight":0.235896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.194836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26270,"sim:weight":0.191844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26706,"sim:weight":0.182847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.180494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391751,"sim:weight":0.176084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.129502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.119834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The vast majority of these studies focus on the essence of the state rather than how it is experienced and lived by its citizens and therefore sacrifice empirical knowledge of state function in favour of abstract conceptualisation. Much academic literature, especially the neopatrimonial approach dominant in political science, examines African states through the prism of Weberian logic and suggests that, because states do not conform to a rational-legal ideal, they must therefore be deficient. These analyses also frequently downplay the impact of colonial rule and postcolonial state formation and politics on the character of contemporary African states, instead stressing the continuities between pre-colonial and modern patterns of rule.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis thesis eschews a normative understanding of the state in favour of an approach grounded in everyday action through analysis of the workings of the Nigerian higher education sector. I argue that this sector is a microcosm of broader state-society relations. The thesis draws on primary data collected through ethnographic methods to analyse how providers and users of a university in south-eastern Nigeria negotiate their passage into, and through, a highly complex and flexible institution. The thesis argues that, among both students and staff, achieving success in Nigerian higher education is dependent on a combination of merit, personal connections and money. The importance of these three elements suggests a system in which norms rooted in bureaucracy (merit), patron-clientism (personal connections) and financial corruption (money) intersect. My empirical research suggests that characterisations of African states as wholly captured by society and functioning as little more than vehicles for particularistic advancement, both central elements of much neopatrimonial state literature, are therefore inaccurate. The thesis also places the Nigerian state in historical context, arguing that, while some patterns of pre-colonial behaviour remain important in contemporary Nigeria, they have been fundamentally altered by colonialism and its aftermath.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis thesis offers an important corrective to the rather abstract and normative ideas that underpin the theory of the African neopatrimonial state.

All three variants of CXCR3 were detected in cord blood-derived mast cells at the mRNA level. Using an antibody that is unable to distinguish individual CXCR3 isoforms, we detected a marked down-regulation of intracellular protein during maturation from progenitor cells, with no concomitant changes in the modest surface expression of CXCR3. The known CXCR3 agonists CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 as well as the reported CXCR3-B agonist CXCL4, were able to induce Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, as well as partial degranulation. Responses to all agonists were inhibited by pre-treatment with selective CXCR3 antagonists and pertussis toxin. Use of novel isoform-selective inhibitors indicates that the p110 isoform of PI3K is required for degranulation and signalling responses to CXCR3 agonists. Unexpectedly, dual (but not individual) isoform inhibition of the class I  and  isoforms substantially inhibited signalling and degranulation responses, indicating a hitherto unrecognised synergy between these isoforms, which provide a conduit for CXCR3 signalling in mast cells.","bibo:AuthorList":["Willox, Ian"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2807317,"sim:weight":0.783667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.135232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108066,"sim:weight":0.123268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0670335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.0605244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A key factor enabling and sustaining this reduction is the constantly expanding availability of instruments for dimensional measurement of large-size products. However, the increasing complexity of these measurement systems and their set-up procedures may hinder the final users in their effort to assess whether the performance of these instruments is adequate for pre-specified inspection tasks. In this paper, mixed-effects and fixed-effects linear statistical models are proposed as a tool to assess quantitatively the effect of set-up procedures on the uncertainty of measurement results. This approach is demonstrated on a Metris Indoor GPS system (iGPS). The main conclusion is that more than 99% of the variability in the considered measurements is accounted for by the number of points used in the bundle adjustment procedure during the set-up phase. Also, different regions of the workspace have significantly different error standard deviations and a significant effect on the transient duration of measurement. This is expected to affect adversely the precision and unbiasedness of measurements taken with Indoor GPS when tracking moving objects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ferri, Carlo","Mastrogiacomo, Luca","Faraway, Julian"],"dc:date":"2010-06-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1653331,"sim:weight":0.269522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57340,"sim:weight":0.225591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.22372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52978,"sim:weight":0.211428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.182263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.162115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The present work shows two ways to reduce the flow ripple amplitude generated by a vane pump through the redesigning of the pump rotating group.

Also, a flow ripple experimental test was run using the Secondary Source Method to validate the numerical model results of the regular pump. The new designs simulation results show large flow ripple amplitude reduction (from 6dB to 16dB per harmonic) as well as frequency displacement in the discharge flow ripple spectra in both designs.

Basic goal arbitration is an essential element of low level action selection for cognitive systems, necessarily preceding even deliberate control in the direction of attention. In natural intelligence, chemically regulated motivation systems focus an agent\u0027s behavioural attention on one problem at a time. Such simple durative decision state can improve the efficiency of artificial action selection by avoiding dithering, but taken to extremes such systems can be inefficient and produce cognitively implausible results. This article describes and demonstrates an easy-to-implement, general-purpose latching method that allows for a balance between persistence and flexibility in the presence of interruptions. This appraisal-based system facilitates automatic reassessment of the current focus of attention by existing action-selection mechanisms. The proposed mechanism, flexible latching, drastically improves efficiency in handling multiple competing goals at the cost of a surprisingly small amount of additional code (or cognitive) complexity. We discuss implications of these results for understanding natural cognitive systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rohlfshagen,  Philipp","Bryson, Joanna J."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":87106,"sim:weight":0.27958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84736,"sim:weight":0.179298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.157945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932184,"sim:weight":0.154983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.151518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Neural crest cells also migrate extensively throughout the embryo. The specification of a number of neural crest derivatives, including pigment cells and neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, is dependent on the transcription factor Sox10. In sox10 mutant zebrafish embryos, these neural crest derivatives fail to specify and subsequently the cell differentiation and migration fails leading to apoptosis. Sox10 mutant embryos also display an ear defect although the precise role of Sox10 in the ear is less well defined. Thus Sox10 controls an extensive gene regulatory network that drives the development of an important subset of neural crest derivatives and also functions during ear development. This gene regulatory network is currently poorly defined. The aim of this project was to identify genes that are both direct and indirect targets of Sox10 to further elucidate this gene regulatory network. To achieve this, a microarray approach was adopted. Initially, fluorescence activated cell sorting was employed to enrich for sox10 expressing cells from 24 hours post fertilization sox10:GFP transgenic embryos. The transcriptomes of WT and sox10 mutant cells were compared by microarray analysis to identify differentially regulated genes. A large number of target genes were identified by this method and by an unbiased in situ hybridization screen, 28 genes were validated. Of these, 23 genes were expressed in cells of the neural crest and down-regulated in sox10 mutant embryos. The majority of these genes were expressed in cells of the melanocyte and xanthophore lineages. 5 genes were expressed in the ear (otic vesicle) of which three otic vesicle genes were down-regulated while two otic vesicle genes were up-regulated in sox10 mutant embryos. Unfortunately due to time constraints, a study into the function of one of these target genes could not be completed. The series of validated genes identified during this project has opened new opportunities for research and has identified a number of highly expressed marker genes that will be useful in future studies. In addition, the microarray data presented will be a useful resource to aid the identification of further targets of Sox10.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chipperfield, Thomas Richard"],"dc:date":"2009-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1577121,"sim:weight":0.390209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.132148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.11871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two different cell models were adopted for these investigations; cardiomyocytes isolated from a transgenic mouse line expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP in muscle and L6 myotubes retrovirally expressing HA-GLUT4. The GLUT4 constructs were largely excluded from the external membrane under basal conditions in both cell models. GLUT4 was trafficked to the external membrane in to response all stimuli studied in cardiomyocytes (insulin, contraction and hypoxia) and L6 myotubes (insulin, AICAR and A-769662). By comparing the anti-HA and GFP signals at the sarcolemma and transverse tubules in cardiomyocytes, it has also be possible to observe an enhancement of GSV fusion with the sarcolemma following stimulation with insulin and contraction. This effect was specific to these stimuli and to the sarcolemma. Insulin-stimulation of GLUT4 exocytosis was not detected under steady-state conditions in L6 myotubes. Here, the major effect of insulin-stimulation and AMPK-activation was on GLUT4 internalisation. The rate constant for GLUT4 internalisation was very rapid in basal cells and was decreased during the steady-state responses to insulin and the AMPK-activators AICAR and A-769662. In cardiomyocytes, internalising GLUT4 colocalised with clathrin at puncta at the sarcolemma. This indicates that GLUT4 is internalised via a clathrin-mediated route. Investigations into the amount of GLUT4 recycling in L6 cells under steady-state conditions revealed that a large proportion of cellular GLUT4 recycles with the cell surface under basal conditions. Insulin-stimulation and AMPK-activation additively mobilised GLUT4 in L6 cells. This implies a non-convergent mobilisation of GLUT4 in response to activation of the PKB/Akt and AMPK signalling pathways. Data obtained from an in vitro kinase assay confirmed that serine 237 of TBC1D1 is a bone fide AMPK phosphorylation site. Furthermore, phosphorylation of this site in L6 myotubes incubated with AMPK activators has been confirmed using a novel antibody specific to TBC1D1 phosphorylated at serine 237. This thesis discusses the consequences and importance of multiple controls impinging on GLUT4 traffic and highlights the advantages and limitations of kinetic studies of these processes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fazakerley, Daniel John"],"dc:date":"2010-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.088516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.0700889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A typical application would be the modelling of flow in a porous medium containing a number of inclusions of low (or high) permeability embedded in a matrix of high (respectively low) permeability. Our method is H-1- conforming, with degrees of freedom at the nodes of a triangular mesh and requiring the solution of subgrid problems for the basis functions on elements which straddle the coefficient interface but which use standard linear approximation otherwise. A key point is the introduction of novel coefficient-dependent boundary conditions for the subgrid problems. Under moderate assumptions, we prove that our methods have (optimal) convergence rate of O(h) in the energy norm and O(h(2)) in the L-2 norm where h is the (coarse) mesh diameter and the hidden constants in these estimates are independent of the \"contrast\" (i.e. ratio of largest to smallest value) of the PDE coefficient. For standard elements the best estimate in the energy norm would be O(h(1/2-epsilon)) with a hidden constant which in general depends on the contrast. The new interior boundary conditions depend not only on the contrast of the coefficients, but also on the angles of intersection of the interface with the element edges.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chu,  C.

T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels contribute to cerebral myogenic tone and vasomotion, so we investigated the significance of T-type and other ion channels for membrane potential oscillations underlying arterial spasm. Smooth muscle cell membrane potential (E-m) and tension were measured simultaneously in rat middle cerebral artery. NO synthase blockade caused temporally coupled depolarizing oscillations in cerebrovascular E-m with associated vasoconstriction. Both events were accentuated by block of smooth muscle BKCa. Block of T-type channels or inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase abolished the oscillations in E-m and reduced vasoconstriction. Oscillations in E-m were either attenuated or accentuated by reducing [Ca2+](o) or block of K-V, respectively. TRAM-34 attenuated oscillations in both E-m and tone, apparently independent of effects against K(Ca)3.1. Thus, rapid depolarizing oscillations in E-m and tone observed after endothelial function has been disrupted reflect input from T-type calcium channels in addition to L-type channels, while other depolarizing currents appear to be unimportant.

However, the penetration field consistently decreases with decreasing degree of sample symmetry, in stark contrast to conventional estimates of demagnetization factors using equivalent ellipsoids based on inscribed circles, which predict the reverse trend. Surprisingly, this observation does not appear to have been reported in the literature before.

This unanimity, however, conceals the extent to which the process towards this moment was deeply contested. Exploring the efforts by land sector NGOs to secure legitimacy in their engagements with this process reveals the extent to which wider power relations and contestations have determined their positioning. Those within the non-governmental land sector who opposed the legislation pitted themselves against African National Congress politicians and high-profile traditional leaders. However, the adoption of a Mamdani-inspired discourse to contest such politics and oppose the proposed legislation contributed to re-inscribing narrow readings of knowledge considered to be legitimate. Their engagements were also shaped by changes in the NGO sector. Reduced funding for land sector NGOs and an increasingly ambivalent relationship between them and government contributed to contestations between NGOs and among people working within them. Their strategic engagements in such wider and internal politics influenced both the frames within which such policy change could be debated and the ways in which individuals working for NGOs consequently positioned themselves in relation to their constituents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fortin,  E."],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85449,"sim:weight":0.299275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":709592,"sim:weight":0.25652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108959,"sim:weight":0.237991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930164,"sim:weight":0.2001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86060,"sim:weight":0.144774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The contribution of sex differences in biological maturation to the adolescent decline has received limited attention. This study examined the contribution of somatic maturation to sex differences in objective assessments of sedentary behavior and PA in Portuguese adolescents (N \u003d 302, aged 13-16 years). Maturation was estimated from the percentage of predicted mature stature and physically active and inactive behaviors assessed with Actigraph GTIM accelerometers. The influence of age, sex and their interaction on body size, maturation and physical behaviors were examined using factorial ANOVA and, subsequently, ANCOVA (controlling for maturation) tested the effect of sex. Males spent more time in MVPA and less time in sedentary behavior than females. However, sex differences were attenuated when maturation was controlled; thus suggesting that maturity may play an important role in adolescent behaviors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rodrigues,  A. M.

We show that, within an episode of teacher-led plenary discourse, prosody may be used to signal shifts in footing between different kinds of pedagogic activity. We identify: (i) teacher-led IRF (Initiation–Response–Feedback) discussion; (ii) the teacher\u0027s modelling of exploratory talk; (iii) a shift to instruction-giving. If teachers are able to model the enquiring tone of exploratory talk, they may in turn encourage more thoughtful contributions from students.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skidmore, David","Murakami, Kyoko"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26288,"sim:weight":0.251717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108406,"sim:weight":0.235463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108285,"sim:weight":0.210654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.191502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using a transformation of the circular source to an exactly equivalent set of line source modes, given by Chebyshev polynomials, it is found that the line source modes of order greater than the source wavenumber generate exponentially small fields. Asymptotic analysis shows that the remaining, lower order, modes radiate efficiently only into a region around the source plane, with this region shrinking as the mode order is increased. The results explain the ill-conditioning of source identification methods; the successful use of low order models in active noise control; and the low radiation efficiency of subsonic jets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carley, Michael"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2805949,"sim:weight":0.574341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31348,"sim:weight":0.279155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24050,"sim:weight":0.276913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27116,"sim:weight":0.248207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999041,"sim:weight":0.245848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8746976,"sim:weight":0.236907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1487803,"sim:weight":0.233914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29261,"sim:weight":0.231815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24691,"sim:weight":0.218643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23830,"sim:weight":0.211569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27842,"sim:weight":0.211518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26242,"sim:weight":0.207577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27900,"sim:weight":0.195467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.19207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26618,"sim:weight":0.190122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27377,"sim:weight":0.188996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268060,"sim:weight":0.182842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28998,"sim:weight":0.181247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28686,"sim:weight":0.174723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26766,"sim:weight":0.173043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This inclusivity simultaneously permits an expansion of heteromasculine boundaries, so that boys are able to express physical tactility and emotional intimacy without being homosexualized by their behaviours. However, we add to inclusive masculinity theory by showing the ways in which boys continue to privilege and regulate heterosexuality in the absence of homophobia: we find that heterosexual boundary maintenance continues, heterosexual identities are further consolidated, and the presumption of heterosexuality remains. Accordingly, we argue that even in inclusive cultures, it is necessary to examine for the processes of heteronormativity.","bibo:AuthorList":["McCormack, M","Anderson, Eric"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.160771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.159251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.156087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thirty-eight men were randomly assigned to receive either placebo group (n \u003d 18) or mixed antioxidant (primarily vitamin C \u0026 E) supplements (n \u003d 20) in a double-blind manner. After 6 weeks, participants performed 90 min of intermittent shuttle-running. Peak isometric torque of the knee flexors/extensors and range of motion at this joint were determined before and after exercise, with recovery of these variables tracked for up to 168 h post-exercise. Antioxidant supplementation elevated pre-exercise plasma vitamin C (93 +/- A 8 mu mol l(-1)) and vitamin E (11 +/- A 3 mu mol l(-1)) concentrations relative to baseline (P \u003c 0.001) and the placebo group (P a parts per thousand currency sign 0.02). Exercise reduced peak isometric torque (i.e. 9-19% relative to baseline; P a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001), which persisted for the first 48 h of recovery with no difference between treatment groups. In contrast, changes in the urine concentration of F-2-isoprostanes responded differently to each treatment (P \u003d 0.04), with a tendency for higher concentrations after 48 h of recovery in the supplemented group (6.2 +/- A 6.1 vs. 3.7 +/- A 3.4 ng ml(-1)).

Dietary carbohydrate represents a central component of post-exercise nutrition. Therefore, carbohydrate should be ingested as early as possible in the post-exercise period and at frequent (i.e. 15- to 30-minute) intervals throughout recovery to maximize the rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis. Solid and liquid carbohydrate supplements or whole foods can achieve this aim with equal effect but should be of high glycaemic index and ingested following the feeding schedule described above at a rate of at least 1 g/kg/h in order to rapidly and sufficiently increase both blood glucose and insulin concentrations throughout recovery. Adding ≥0.3 g/kg/h of protein to a carbohydrate supplement results in a synergistic increase in insulin secretion that can, in some circumstances, accelerate muscle glycogen resynthesis. Specifically, if carbohydrate has not been ingested in quantities sufficient to maximize the rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis, the inclusion of protein may at least partially compensate for the limited availability of ingested carbohydrate. Some studies have reported improved physical performance with ingestion of carbohydrate-protein mixtures, both during exercise and during recovery prior to a subsequent exercise test. While not all of the evidence supports these ergogenic benefits, there is clearly the potential for improved performance under certain conditions, e.g. if the additional protein increases the energy content of a supplement and/or the carbohydrate fraction is ingested at below the recommended rate. The underlying mechanism for such effects may be partly due to increased muscle glycogen resynthesis during recovery, although there is varied support for other factors such as an increased central drive to exercise, a blunting of exercise-induced muscle damage, altered metabolism during exercise subsequent to recovery, or a combination of these mechanisms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Betts, James A.","Williams, C."],"dc:date":"2010-11-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5848229,"sim:weight":0.339923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.275125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.181377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.177821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795331,"sim:weight":0.169921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.150211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.141884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.115898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1480477,"sim:weight":0.115804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929904,"sim:weight":0.0873903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Firstly, we endeavour to ascertain the impact of personal characteristics on the concept of Job Mobility with respect to Hour Constraints. Descriptive evidence suggests that almost 40% of British employees are not happy with their working hours. Whether this fact can stimulate job mobility is of our primary interest. We then focus on job satisfaction in attempt to isolate those parameters that can have a decisive effect on it. We exploit a series of subjectively measured covariates in order to tackle unobserved heterogeneity and handle the issue of interpersonal judgements in a more consistent way. Additionally, we estimate job satisfaction profiles to see if the pattern of job satisfaction is different between those employees who changed job and those who did not. The third empirical chapter examines the issues of earnings profiles between the private and the public sector. We argue that the motivational basis for choosing either sector is fundamentally different and this fact should have an impact on the relevant earnings profiles. Public sector workers are expected to exchange a flatter earnings profile for non-pecuniary aspects of their job, including the satisfaction with the work it self. Finally, we look at the probability of becoming self-employed, conditional upon the receipt of a windfall and the consideration of social capital variables. We want to see if the inclusion of the latter can have any impact on the predicting power of windfalls, given that recent research highlighted the relationship between social capital variables and the probability of receiving a windfall.","bibo:AuthorList":["Katsaros, Andreas"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We define the right-most particle, R-t, to be the supremum of the spatial positions of the particles alive at time t and study the asymptotics of R-t as t -\u003e infinity. In the case of constant breeding at rate beta the linear asymptotic for R-t is long established. Here, we find asymptotic results for R-t in the case p is an element of (0, 2]. In contrast to the linear asymptotic in standard BBM we find polynomial asymptotics of arbitrarily high order as p up arrow 2, and a non-trivial limit for In R-t when p \u003d 2. Our proofs rest on the analysis of certain additive martingales, and related spine changes of measure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harris,  J.

Extensive research has been undertaken over the recent years to understand their environmental fate and toxicity. The one very important phenomenon that has been overlooked by environmental researchers studying the fate of pharmacologically active compounds in the environment is their chirality. Chiral drugs can exist in the form of enantiomers, which have similar physicochemical properties but differ in their biological properties such as distribution, metabolism and excretion, as these processes (due to stereospecific interactions of enantiomers with biological systems) usually favour one enantiomer over the other. Additionally, due to different pharmacological activity, enantiomers of chiral drugs can differ in toxicity. Furthermore, degradation of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment and in the environment can be stereoselective and can lead to chiral products of varied toxicity. The distribution of different enantiomers of the same chiral drug in the aquatic environment and biota can also be stereoselective. Biological processes can lead to stereoselective enrichment or depletion of the enantiomeric composition of chiral drugs. As a result the very same drug might reveal different activity and toxicity and this will depend on its origin and exposure to several factors governing its fate in the environment. In this critical review a discussion of the importance of chirality of pharmacologically active compounds in the environmental context is undertaken and suggestions for directions in further research are made. Several groups of chiral drugs of major environmental relevance are discussed and their pharmacological action and disposition in the body is also outlined as it is a key factor in developing a full understanding of their environmental occurrence, fate and toxicity. This review will be of interest to environmental scientists, especially those interested in issues associated with environmental contamination with pharmacologically active compounds and chiral pollutants. As the review will outline current state of knowledge on chiral drugs, it will be of value to anyone interested in the phenomenon of chirality, chiral drugs, their stereoselective disposition in the body and environmental fate","bibo:AuthorList":["Kasprzyk-Hordern, Barbara"],"dc:date":"2010-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":340562,"sim:weight":0.228146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384090,"sim:weight":0.217529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384903,"sim:weight":0.217224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.209197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97721,"sim:weight":0.174177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.147873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567333,"sim:weight":0.140348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97743,"sim:weight":0.108879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In Doney and Kyprianou [Ann. Appl. Probab. 16 (2006) 91-106] a new quintuple law was established for a general Levy process at first passage below a fixed level. In this article we use the quintuple law to establish a family of related joint laws, which we call n-tuple laws, for Levy processes, Levy processes conditioned to stay positive and positive self-similar Markov processes at both first and last passage over a fixed level. Here the integer n typically ranges from three to seven. Moreover, we look at asymptotic overshoot and undershoot distributions and relate them to overshoot and undershoot distributions of positive self-similar Markov processes issued from the origin. Although the relation between the n-tuple laws for Levy processes and positive self-similar Markov processes are straightforward thanks to the Lamperti transformation, by interplaying the role of a (conditioned) stable processes as both a (conditioned) Levy processes and a positive self-similar Markov processes, we obtain a suite of completely explicit first and last passage identities for so-called Lamperti-stable Levy processes. This leads further to the introduction of a more general family of Levy processes which we call hypergeometric Levy processes, for which similar explicit identities may be considered.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kyprianou, Andreas E.","Pardo,  J.

The need for such a model is explained: previous models of substance misuse and the family have attributed dysfunction or deficiency to families or family members. In contrast, the SSCS model assumes that having a close relative with a substance misuse problem constitutes a form of stressful life circumstances, often longstanding, which puts affected family members at risk of experiencing strain in the form of physical and/or psychological ill-health. Coping and social support are the two other central building blocks of the model. Affected family members are viewed as ordinary people faced with the task of coping with such stressful life circumstances. It is an assumption of the model that, difficult though the coping task is, family members need not be powerless in maintaining their own health and helping their relatives. Good quality social support, in the form of emotional support, good information and material help, is an invaluable resource for affected family members, supporting their coping efforts and contributing positively to their health. The 5-Step Method, to be described later in the supplement, is based on the SSCS model. It can be seen as a way of increasing the positive social support available from professional sources.","bibo:AuthorList":["Orford, Jim","Copello, Alex","Velleman, Richard","Templeton, Lorna"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":59462,"sim:weight":0.246863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.234118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.211912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.183522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.168755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Female partners and mothers are the family members who have been most represented in the study samples, but the latter also included sizeable numbers of male partners, fathers, sisters, brothers and adult sons and daughters. Citing examples taken from the studies, the article describes some of the most prominent elements of the stressful experience of living with a relative who is drinking or taking drugs excessively, notably: the relationship with a relative becoming disagreeable and sometimes aggressive; conflict over money and possessions; the experience of uncertainty; worry about the relative; and home and family life being threatened. The reasons why family members may put up with substance misuse are described, and the ways in which family members may either withdraw and gain independence or stand up to substance misuse, as alternative ways of coping, are outlined. Examples of the strain experienced by family members are given. The kinds of social support valued by family members are explained, as is the finding that good quality social support for family members is often lacking. The article concludes by offering an integrated view highlighting the disempowered position in which family members usually find themselves and the importance of good social support for family members in their coping efforts.

Work with five teams is described. The process varied but in all cases it included recruitment of the team, training, continued support and evaluation of results. Use of a standard questionnaire for assessing attitudes towards working with affected family members showed significant changes in team members’ knowledge, confidence and team support for working with family members. Records of all project events and meetings suggested that change takes time but that a ‘cultural change’ can take place whereby earlier misgivings are dispelled and positive attitudes towards involving family members become embedded in a team\u0027s approach. Diary audit indicated that the frequency of involvement of family members in sessions can be increased three- to five-fold, with teams beginning to carry out work with a diversity of family members, in diverse ways and with diverse positive outcomes. In a number of cases, teams were encouraged to institute new family-friendly procedures, for example changes to appointment letters, assessments and design of waiting and counselling rooms. Lessons have been learnt, including the need to accommodate different levels of initial experience of working with family members, and the need to be clear about project aims and objectives. Sustainability of change remains an issue. A general conclusion is that the capacity of services to take on work with family members affected by substance misuse of close relatives varies greatly. Where organizations already have a mission to involve family members, capacity is good. Where alcohol and drug services have previously been focused on individuals who are misusing substances, change is difficult but can be achieved. For most non substance-specialist organizations, such as primary care health centres and most non-statutory organizations, capacity is very limited. In addition to training and continued support for practitioners, explicit commissioning of work with family members combined with management support is necessary.","bibo:AuthorList":["Orford, Jim","Templeton, Lorna","Copello, Alex","Velleman, Richard","Ibanga, Akanidomo"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.24737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10062,"sim:weight":0.241244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.235387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266223,"sim:weight":0.22003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.197515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109025,"sim:weight":0.183112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Quantitative experimental validation using hierarchies from two state of art algorithms show we can reduce the number of levels and regions in a hierarchy by an order of magnitude with little or no loss in performance when compared against human produced ground truth.

We also investigated whether user performance was affected by a match between the plane of the tactile interface and the plane in which the users drew the perceived directions. Finally, we investigated the effect of adding a complementary visual display. The touch screen display on which participants drew the perceived directions presented either a blank display or a visual display of a map indicating eight directions from a central roundabout, corresponding to the eight directions indicated by the tactile stimuli. We found that participants performed significantly faster and more accurately with the belt than with the array whether they had a vertical screen or a horizontal screen.

An experiment was used to investigate whether restrictiveness or guidance in a support system leads to more effective use of judgment. Users received statistical forecasts of the demand for products that were subject to promotions. In the restrictiveness mode small judgmental adjustments to these forecasts were prohibited (research indicates that these waste effort and may damage accuracy). In the guidance mode users were advised to make adjustments in promotion periods, but not to adjust in non-promotion periods. A control group of users were not subject to restrictions and received no guidance. The results showed that neither restrictiveness nor guidance led to improvements in accuracy. While restrictiveness reduced unnecessary adjustments, it deterred desirable adjustments and also encouraged over-large adjustments so that accuracy was damaged. Guidance encouraged more desirable system use, but was often ignored. Surprisingly, users indicated it was less acceptable than restrictiveness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Goodwin, Paul","Fildes, R","Lawrence, M","Stephens, G"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1555512,"sim:weight":0.341636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555308,"sim:weight":0.302368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555599,"sim:weight":0.289297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555162,"sim:weight":0.259839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65151,"sim:weight":0.216609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585490,"sim:weight":0.133691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.121097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.116976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.113035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652986,"sim:weight":0.109729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.10778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85995,"sim:weight":0.107733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study has been directed towards addressing those that are not only complex but also ill structured and evolving. In order to address such problems an approach has been developed that employs sensitivity analysis and problem strategies to form an evolving direct search technique. Whilst this is generic approach that has been applied to a range of engineering problems it is illustrated here through its use in a study into the posture modelling of humans. In this it was recognized that such a new approach was required due to the complex description, limits and postures possible in the human body.","bibo:AuthorList":["Medland, A J","Matthews, Jason"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1574764,"sim:weight":0.323031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931240,"sim:weight":0.273308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.268647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61040,"sim:weight":0.250276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.225896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26022,"sim:weight":0.217605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25806,"sim:weight":0.207026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Data relating to the entry qualifications and final A level grades achieved by 879 students on both accelerated and non-accelerated programmes were obtained over a four-year period. Inferential analysis was carried out using pairwise Z-tests to compare the proportion of students achieving grade C or better on each course. A sample of 89 students completed a written questionnaire, which was used to examine their attitudes and opinions of accelerated and non-accelerated teaching and learning. It was found that students on accelerated programmes who had taken Business Studies at GCSE or who achieved an A* or A grade in English or Maths at GCSE were more likely to get a grade of C or above at A level compared to students on the standard two-year programme. The results of this study suggest that further research is needed to assess whether more students could be successful on accelerated A level courses, or similar post-compulsory courses internationally.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilkins, Stephen","Martin, Susan","Walker, Ian"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.461344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108251,"sim:weight":0.272921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23990,"sim:weight":0.237815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These pumps can suffer from erosion due to cavitation, which eventually causes an increase in leakage and reduced performance. An early warning of excessive wear is desirable, before the performance becomes unacceptable so that replacement can be scheduled conveniently without disrupting the operation of the aircraft. Pressure ripple and flow ripple measurements were performed on a range of fuel pumps with bearing conditions ranging from good to badly worn. The flow ripple was determined indirectly by analysis of pressure ripple measurements. Results suggest that there is a clear and fairly consistent increase in the pressure ripple and flow ripple measured at the high-pressure outlet port when the bearing is in a worn condition. This increase seems to occur at a wear condition that is not sufficiently bad to worsen the pump performance significantly. This measurement could provide a clear and simple indication of pump wear, at an opportune point in the wear cycle. However whilst these results look promising they are not conclusive, as other differences between the pumps may have affected the results.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnston, D Nigel","Todd, Catherine"],"dc:date":"2010-09-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The study may be described as deductive (Bryman \u0026 Bell 2007) in its approach to the examination of the alignment of practice in integrating information and communications technology (ICT) into teaching learning and assessing (TL\u0026A), against a strategic framework based on the idea of a measure of learning organization maturity in the IOT sector in Ireland. The literature review found that throughout the evolution of strategic thinking, higher education institutes (HEIs) have endeavoured to adopt many of the strategic models, associated with the wider business community, which have emerged over the latter half of the 20th century. However differences in governance, organizational structure, decision making mechanisms and expectation have led to resistance to and rejection of many of these strategic approaches. As part of this study, strategic initiatives supporting ICT integration are examined from different stakeholder perspectives such as those of management and academic staff. The study then moves on to exploration of the idea of learning organization maturity to ascertain its suitability as a strategic framework for the purposes of this study. The study poses the research question:\r\n\r\nIs it possible to correlate, the identification of learning organization maturity, with the level of integration of ICT into TL\u0026A in the IOT sector in Ireland?\r\n\r\nTo seek answers to this question and derivative questions the management (both academic and non-academic) and the academic staff cohorts within the subject institutes were surveyed online using a learning organization profile (LOP) tool, adapted from the work of Marquardt (2002), and a new ICT integration level investigative tool developed by the writer. Findings were statistically analysed to establish whether differences exist in learning organizational profiles (LOP) for different cohorts and category variables. Where practicable comparative analyses with similar studies unearthed in the literature review were undertaken. Next correlation between learning organization maturity and ICT integration levels is examined. Finally conclusions are drawn where they emerged and recommendations for possible follow up studies are outlined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murphy, Pearse"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1654023,"sim:weight":0.259551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.195677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29843,"sim:weight":0.176305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51534,"sim:weight":0.159128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Consequently, migrant women from developing countries provide an inexpensive and accessible child care alternative, which could be regarded as widespread in certain regions. Growth in the movement of population and mounting global interdependence, has also contributed to an increase in educational institutions labelled international schools. As an educator in five of these diverse institutions, I became aware that the trend of hiring maids, who because of their social position often do many basic tasks for children in their care, has entered the world of international schools in particular geographical areas. This has often concerned professionals. This small-scale study, therefore, explores the perceived social and educational implications of home/school differences in pedagogic orientation in children who have maids, bringing to light a matter of consequence, to certain international schools in particular, in more academic terms. Two very different schools in the Arabian Gulf, both regarded as operating in an international context, were the focus for this study. Drawing on Vygotskian and post-Vygotskian theories, I used sociocultural theory and Engeström’s model of activity theory as a theoretical framework from which to design the inquiry, and carry out the analysis. Using the two sample schools to access key-stakeholders, this inquiry involved multi-methods of mainly qualitative data collection, which explored a situation where maids are often heavily involved in children’s upbringing. A range of nationalities were included. Important messages emerged, including the notion of maids appearing to be culturally embedded amongst a number of affluent host country nationals and expatriates in my context. Additionally, significant differences appear to exist between children with maids at home and those without, with implications for learning amongst ‘maid children’, which might be perceived as a result of maid intervention. The thesis concludes with recommendations for educationalists and parents. Views of most key stakeholders underpin a model which could guide new practice and go some way towards alleviating the consequences of such a situation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bradley, Gail"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.324582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.2959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.28212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109086,"sim:weight":0.280593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.273609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.226634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108065,"sim:weight":0.194208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two classes of drag coefficient functions are considered, namely those with linear growth near the origin and those with constant or more generally sublinear growth there. A mathematical characterisation of all possible equilibria of these screw wall microstructures is give. We also prove the existence of travelling wave solutions for linear drag coefficient functinos at low wave speeds and rule out the existence of nonconstant bounded travelling wave solutions for sublinear drag coefficients functions. It turns out that the appropriate concept of a solution in this scalar case is that of a viscosity solution. The governing equation in the static case is not proper and it is shown that no comparison principle holds. The findings indicate a short-range nature of the stress field of the individual dislocation walls, which indicates that the nonlinearity present in the model may have a stabilishing effect. We predict idealised dislocation-free cells of almost arbitrary size interspersed with dipolar dislocation wall microstructures as admissible equilibria of our model, a feature in sharp contrast with predictions of the possible non-monotone equilibria of the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau phase field type gradient flow model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Acharya,  A.","Matthies, Karsten","Zimmer, J"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These are three-dimensional structures consisting of a ferromagnetic shell which is grown on top of a non-magnetic core. The standard micromagnetic model without the magnetocrystalline anisotropy term is used to describe the properties of the shell. We vary the thickness of the shell between the limiting cases of an ultra-thin shell and a conventional pyramid and delineate different stable magnetic configurations. We find different kinds of single-domain states, which predominantly occur at smaller system sizes. In analogy to equivalent states in thin square films we term these onion, flower, C and S states. At larger system sizes, we also observe two types of vortex states, which we refer to as symmetric and asymmetric vortex states. For a classification of the observed states, we derive a phase diagram that specifies the magnetic ground state as a function of structure size and shell thickness. The transitions between different ground states can be understood qualitatively. We address the issue of metastability by investigating the stability of all occurring configurations for different shell thicknesses. For selected geometries and directions hysteresis measurements are analysed and discussed. We observe that the magnetic behaviour changes distinctively in the limit of ultra-thin shells. The study has been motivated by the recent progress made in the growth of faceted core-shell structures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Knittel,  A.","Franchin,  M.","Fischbacher,  T.","Nasirpouri,  F.","Bending, Simon J.","Fangohr,  H."],"dc:date":"2010-11-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24010,"sim:weight":0.630718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22633,"sim:weight":0.468398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2810287,"sim:weight":0.443903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9733,"sim:weight":0.431918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513233,"sim:weight":0.390556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23892,"sim:weight":0.290644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.270824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26944,"sim:weight":0.228858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26706,"sim:weight":0.228406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26958,"sim:weight":0.215555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23890,"sim:weight":0.194036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.172109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23887,"sim:weight":0.157308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.152403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85213,"sim:weight":0.14352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.141257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268818,"sim:weight":0.140798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26711,"sim:weight":0.13444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One radar is located at Rothera (68 degrees S, 68 degrees W) in the Antarctic and has been operational since February 2005. The second radar is located at Esrange (68 degrees N, 21 degrees E) in the Arctic and has been operational since October 1999. Both radars have produced relatively continuous measurements. Here we consider measurements made up to the end of 2009. Both radars are of similar design and at conjugate geographical latitudes, making the results directly comparable and thus allowing investigation of the differences in the mean winds of the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The data from each radar have been used to construct climatologies of monthly-mean zonal and meridional winds at heights between 80 and 100 km. Both Antarctic and Arctic data sets reveal seasonally varying zonal and meridional winds in which the broad pattern repeats from year to year. In particular, the zonal winds display a strong shear in summer associated with the upper part of the westward summertime zonal jet. The winds generally reverse to eastward flow at heights of similar to 90 km. The zonal winds are eastward throughout the rest of the year. The meridional winds are generally equatorward over both sites, although brief episodes of poleward flow are often evident near the equinoxes and during winter. The strongest equatorward flows occur at heights of similar to 90 km during summer. There are significant differences between the mean winds observed in the Antarctic and Arctic. In particular, the westward winds in summer are stronger and occur earlier in the season in the Antarctic compared with the Arctic. The eastward winds evident above the summertime zonal wind reversal are significantly stronger in the Arctic. The summertime equatorward flow in the Antarctic is slightly weaker, but occurs over a greater depth than is the case in the Arctic. Comparisons of these observations with those of the URAP and HWM-07 empirical models reveal a number of significant differences. In particular, the zonal winds observed in the Antarctic during wintertime are significantly weaker than those of URAP. However, the URAP zonal winds are a good match to the observations of the Arctic. Significant differences are evident between the observations and HWM-07. In particular, the strong wintertime zonal winds of the Arctic in HWM-07 are not evident in the observations and the summertime zonal winds in HWM-07 are systematically stronger than observed. The agreement with meridional winds is generally poor. There is a significant amount of inter-annual variability in the observed zonal and meridional winds. Particularly high variability is observed in the Arctic zonal winds in spring and is probably associated with stratospheric warmings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sandford, David J.","Beldon, Charlotte L.","Hibbins,  R.

An initial review of the funding to these institutions suggested that the allocations were arbitrary as there were no correlation with their enrolment and missions. This led to the identification of the financing policies for HE which gave rise to the main question “What are the consequences (intended and unintended) of the different models adopted by Jamaica for the financing of higher education?” Also in tracing the evolution of HE in Jamaica four sub-questions arouse which were:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e1.\r\nWhat are the consequences of an unchanged financing model for a system that has shifted from a single provider to diverse providers?\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n2.\r\nWhat are the consequences of financing both a national higher education system and a regional one?\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n3.\r\nWhat were the philosophical underpinnings to the allocation of resources to HE in Jamaica?\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n4.\r\nWhat models are available to the Jamaican government for allocating resources to HE?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth sub-question was used as the basis for the literature search and review.

Conventional schemes for simulating models of such systems are hamstrung by the difficulty of relaxing the large species in the presence of the small one. Here we describe how the rejection-free geometrical cluster algorithm of Liu and Luijten [J. Liu and E. Luijten, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 035504 (2004)] can be embedded within a restricted Gibbs ensemble to facilitate efficient and accurate studies of fluid phase behavior of highly size-asymmetrical mixtures. After providing a detailed description of the algorithm, we summarize the bespoke analysis techniques of [Ashton et al., J. Chem. Phys. 132, 074111 (2010)] that permit accurate estimates of coexisting densities and critical-point parameters. We apply our methods to study the liquid-vapor phase diagram of a particular mixture of Lennard-Jones particles having a 10: 1 size ratio. As the reservoir volume fraction of small particles is increased in the range of 0%-5%, the critical temperature decreases by approximately 50%, while the critical density drops by some 30%. These trends imply that in our system, adding small particles decreases the net attraction between large particles, a situation that contrasts with hard-sphere mixtures where an attractive depletion force occurs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ashton, Douglas J.","Liu,  J.

Maternal smoking and adolescent alcohol use were associated with smoking among both sexes.

Here, we test these propositions in Drosophila melanogaster. The challenge for such analyses is to provide defendable measures of germline gene expression. Intronic AT skew is a good candidate measure as it is thought to be a consequence, at least in part, of transcription-coupled repair. Prior evidence suggests that intronic AT skew in D. melanogaster is not affected by proximity to intron extremities and differs between transcribed DNA and flanking sequence. We now also establish that intronic AT skew is a defendable proxy for germline expression as (a) it is more similar than expected by chance between introns of the same gene (which is not accounted for by physical proximity), (b) is correlated with male germline expression, and (c) is more pronounced in broadly expressed genes. Furthermore, (d) a trend for intronic skew to differ between 3\u0027 and 5\u0027 ends of genes is particular to broadly expressed genes. Finally, (e) controlling for physical distance, introns of proximate genes are most different in skew if they have different tissue specificity. We find that intronic AT skew, employed as a proxy for germline transcription, correlates neither with recombination rates nor with the rate of protein evolution. We conclude that there is no prima facie evidence that germline expression modulates recombination rates or monotonically affects protein evolution rates in D. melanogaster.","bibo:AuthorList":["Weber, Claudia C","Hurst, Laurence D"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24013,"sim:weight":0.194251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85444,"sim:weight":0.167093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1577103,"sim:weight":0.154473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1577100,"sim:weight":0.134854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.119659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.112295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25913,"sim:weight":0.0960302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.0892299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.0869833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Through contextualising the field within a corporatised university system that favours instrumentalised forms of knowledge, we challenge the mythopoeic status afforded to the terminology ‘sport’ and ‘coaching’, instead proposing the moniker Physical Pedagogic Bricolage (PPB) to better encapsulate a reconceptualised field. Through opening the field to the deep interdisciplinarity of bricolage, we sketch a more democratic field that promotes understanding, communication, and, creates structures that allow for a better informed, more rigorous, mode of knowledge production which has the power to move the field of sports coaching in a more progressive direction. This is a project that connects coaching to a broader notion of cultural politics designed to further a multiracial, economic and political democracy, a project that connects theory to social change, textual analysis to practical politics, and academic inquiry to public spheres [1]. Of course, we fully recognise that such a challenge to the ontological core of the field will be contested. As such, we intend this paper less as a prescription for coaching research and more of a directional purview that invites-expects-critical dialogue, response and debate as we work towards a set of perhaps competing knowledges, epistemologies, and, axiological approaches that together can ‘do coaching justice.’","bibo:AuthorList":["Bush, Anthony J","Silk, Michael"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.210634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.192475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85489,"sim:weight":0.182194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.156835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Given that retinoids have apoptotic effects, we hypothesized that a decrease in the number of serotoninergic neurons in the DRN or median raphe nucleus (MRN) would lead to decreased serotoninergic tone and in turn to the behavioural changes seen with previous term13-cisnext term-RA previous termadministration.next term Here, we used immunolabelling and unbiased stereological methods to estimate the number of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurons in the MRN and DRN of vehicle control and previous term13-cisnext term-RA-treated adult mice.

Similarly, changes in the density of serotoninergic neurons or in the volume of the MRN or DRN were not observed in previous term13-cisnext term-RA treated animals.

Characterisation of\r\nS. aureus proteins is required to deepen understanding of infection and immunity and for continued development of antibacterial therapy. Extracellular fibrinogen binding protein, Efb, binds both fibrinogen and complement components. The C-terminal complement modulating domain of Efb, Efb-C, is well characterised. NMR data analysis suggests that the N-terminal fibrinogen binding region of Efb is natively unstructured. Previously characterised fibrinogen binding domains of S. aureus proteins are typically structured and so Efb may show a novel mechanism of fibrinogen binding. Staphylococcal binder of immunoglobulin, Sbi, confers host immune evasion through binding to both immunoglobulins and complement components. The solution structure of the complement binding domain of Sbi, Sbi IV, has been determined and reveals a conformation seen in other complement modulating proteins of S. aureus. The effect of Sbi IV and Efb on the complement activation pathways has been investigated and reveals key differences in the action of each of these proteins. The crystal structure of Sbi IV in complex with C3d has been determined and reveals that the interaction of Sbi IV with C3d is similar to that of other complement modulating proteins with C3d. NMR and X-ray diffraction data also reveal a potential second physiologically relevant mode of Sbi IV – C3d binding. Immunodominant staphylococcal antigen B, IsaB, is an uncharacterised protein whose expression may be correlated with immune evasion.

We find that whilst a small number of cities, mostly in OECD countries, have derived quantitative estimates of the costs of climate change risks under alternative scenarios, this form of analysis is in its infancy. The climate risks most frequently addressed in existing studies are associated with sea-level rise, health and water resources. Other sectors such as energy, transport, and built infrastructure remain less studied. The review has also undertaken a case study to examine the progress in two cities—London and New York—which are relatively advanced in the assessment of climate risks and adaptation. The case studies show that these cities have benefited from stakeholder engagement at an early stage in their risk assessments. They have also benefited from the development of specific institutional responsibilities for co-ordinating such research from the outset. This involvement has been critical in creating momentum and obtaining resources for subsequent in-depth analysis of sectoral impacts and adaptation needs..While low cost climate down-scaling applications would be useful in future research, the greatest priority is to develop responses that can work within the high future uncertainty of future climate change, to build resilience and maintain flexibility.

This contribution aims to clarify the physical processes which are relevant for the spatial spreading of the radio wave energy below and above the ionosphere and thereby enables an experimental simulation of satellite observations of 100 kHz radio waves from relativistic electron beams above thunderclouds. The simulation uses the DEMETER satellite which observes 100 kHz radio waves from fifty terrestrial Long Range Aid to Navigation (LORAN) transmitters. Their mean luminosity patch in the plasmasphere is a circular area with a radius of 300 km and a power density of 22 μW/Hz as observed at 660 km height above the ground. The luminosity patches exhibit a southward displacement of 450 km with respect to the locations of the LORAN transmitters. The displacement is reduced to 150 km when an upward propagation of the radio waves along the geomagnetic field line is assumed. This residual displacement indicates that the radio waves undergo 150 km sub-ionospheric propagation prior to entering a magnetospheric duct and escaping into near-Earth space. The residual displacement at low (L \u003c 2.14) and high (L \u003e 2.14) geomagnetic latitudes ranges from 100 km to 200 km which suggests that the smaller inclination of the geomagnetic field lines at low latitudes helps to trap the radio waves and to keep them in the magnetospheric duct. Diffuse luminosity areas are observed northward of the magnetic conjugate locations of LORAN transmitters at extremely low geomagnetic latitudes (L \u003c 1.36) in Southeast Asia. This result suggests that the propagation along the geomagnetic field lines results in a spatial spreading of the radio wave energy over distances of 1 Mm. The summative assessment of the electric field intensities measured in space show that nadir observations of terrestrial 100 kHz radio waves, e.g., from relativistic electron beams above thunderclouds, are attenuated by at least 50 dB when taking into account a transionospheric attenuation of 40 dB.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fullekrug, Martin","Hanuise, C","Parrot, M"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":710411,"sim:weight":0.339893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68027,"sim:weight":0.312475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68201,"sim:weight":0.282931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69159,"sim:weight":0.263677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71069,"sim:weight":0.25169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69556,"sim:weight":0.250099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708703,"sim:weight":0.24726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710789,"sim:weight":0.245913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711422,"sim:weight":0.244055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708107,"sim:weight":0.238861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71171,"sim:weight":0.234361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710297,"sim:weight":0.232706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998749,"sim:weight":0.227681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710661,"sim:weight":0.227226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711943,"sim:weight":0.216941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70889,"sim:weight":0.214173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710928,"sim:weight":0.209585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998739,"sim:weight":0.206464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708575,"sim:weight":0.20336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708030,"sim:weight":0.189056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study built on previous work by the author (Hewitt 2002, 2004) that established that addiction could be seen as a trauma, and that both negative and positive effects could result from the experience. This research sought to explore the experience of posttraumatic growth in recovery from addiction. The aim was to clarify more explicitly the experiences of some of the people who reported PTG in relation to addiction, increasing our awareness and understanding of some of the outcomes, strategies and processes involved, and the implications of these findings. The research comprised two studies. In the first, the experience of 16 people who felt they had PTG effects resulting from their previous addiction to drugs or alcohol was analysed using Grounded Theory. In the second study, the experience and views of another three people who fulfilled the same criteria but in addition were also ‘experts’ in this area were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Combining the data analysis from both studies described a uniquely personal overall process of individuation, with growth along a developmental continuum from addiction recovery to thriving resulting from the deliberate use and generation of recovery capital and growth capital. There were a large range of positive feedback loops that supported this growth, and meaning was of central and ongoing importance. The study findings were compared to the wider PTG literature and found to have much in common, further supporting the view that addiction can be seen as a stressor in PTG terms, and suggesting that there may be much theory and practice from the PTG field that can be applied to the area of addiction recovery. Limitations of the study are discussed, and recommendations made for further testing of the model developed within the thesis in order to examine its generalisability, as well as for study and theory development, and for the development of policy and practice relating to promoting recovery from addictions and subsequent growth.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hewitt, A J"],"dc:date":"2007-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23366,"sim:weight":0.459411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53693,"sim:weight":0.216012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57679,"sim:weight":0.157785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

During fuel transfer between the tanks, when controlling the aircraft centre of gravity or engine feed and refuel operations, a number of pumps and valves are involved resulting in complex pressure and flow interactions. In order to minimise the pressure surges during sudden system changes and flow overshoot during fuel transfer and refuelling, different motor drive system control strategies have been investigated. It is proposed that the current control method of electrically driven centrifugal-type pumps could be replaced by improved open and closed loop strategies where the flow overshoot can be minimised and pressure surges reduced. Steady-state and dynamic models of an AC induction motor drive and typical aircraft fuel system pipework components have been developed. The validation of these models has been performed using experimental data obtained from a fuel test rig constructed at the University of Bath using water as the working fluid. The simulation results have been shown to agree well with those from experimentation. In addition, the induction motor has been modelled based on its physical properties using the Finite Element Method software MEGA. The investigated fuel system has been described in linear terms and its behaviour has been identified. It is shown that the system dynamic behaviour can be controlled/improved using well established closed loop proportional-integral control. An open loop technique of simultaneous pump and valve control has been proposed and validated using experimental results, resulting in a reduction of both the transient pressure surges and flow overshoot during sudden valve closures, showing significant performance improvements. Improved closed loop control strategies for the pump drive system have also been developed in simulation. These are based on adaptive proportional-integral-derivative and fuzzy logic control strategies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stawinski, G."],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Among these challenges, one that is sometimes overlooked is that of simply keeping track of all the data that need to be managed. In some cases, no measures at all are put in place to track the data, meaning that researchers must rely on their memory to make sense of the files they generate in the course of their research. In others, directory and file naming conventions may be used, according to a researcher\u0027s own scheme or one set out by the research group or department. Still other researchers may keep written records of which data arose from which processes. These techniques each present a different trade-off between investment and return in terms of a researcher\u0027s effort to document and understand the data, respectively. They also provide third parties - curators, consumers - with different amounts of contextual information with which to understand the data, though this is in turn affected by the quality of the documentation of the technique in use. The ERIM Project is devising an alternative technique for keeping track of data, with the aim of being: intuitive for researchers when recording progress, and for both researchers and third parties when trying to understand the data records; applicable to a wide variety of data types and disciplines (though developed in the context of engineering research); compatible with existing local practices; amenable to automation, at both the writing and the reading stages. This technique, Research Activity Information Development (RAID) modelling, provides a formalism for describing how data records - and conceivably individual data - relate to one another. The RAID models may be represented as diagrams or as XML. Underlying RAID modelling is an ontology for data, their states and the processes that relate them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ball, Alexander","Darlington, Mansur","Howard, Thomas"],"dc:date":"2010-12-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This is particularly true of social insect colonies where independent access to resources is not available to all members. Only a fraction of individuals are responsible for obtaining food for the colony from outside the nest. Surprisingly little is known about how this food is subsequently distributed to members inside the nest. The work in this thesis is focused around a set of food distribution experiments conducted using four colonies of the ant Temnothorax albipennis. The study applies a well-used technique in a new way to investigate the distribution of food under two different scenarios: feeding under normal conditions and famine relief feeding after a period of starvation. All ants in each colony are marked and then individually tracked recording every feeding interaction to obtain a complete network of food transmission. This work has shown that all four colonies efficiently relieved the famine within 30 minutes of introducing new food. This process was facilitated by workers abandoning their spatial structure and expanding their space use; feeding multiple recipients from a single donor; and simultaneously spreading stored food and new food. Recruitment of foragers did not play a major role in relieving the famine but foragers were responsible for most of the first round of feeding. The study revealed that not all members received the same amount of food and most ants received food in multiple feeding interactions. The transmission pathways used to distribute the food present an opportunity for harmful substances to spread. The pathways are explored in this context to see whether the colonies might aim to minimize the spread by partitioning the pathways or maximise spread by mixing to promote social immunity. The study reveals behavioural differences between the four colonies which are likely to result from the inherent variation in demographic and geometric properties. These differences highlight the flexibility of ant colonies during problem solving under different conditions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hayward, Rebecca K."],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Sufferers are afflicted with hypersensitivity to environmental agents such as soaps (detergents), animal dander, pollen, specific foods and sometimes even water. Genetic mutations in atopic eczema compromise the development of the stratum corneum resulting in xerotic skin that is prone to cracking and increased permeability which leads to irritation due to the influx of exogenous material through the skin. The causes of atopic eczema are due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors and it is, therefore, a difficult disease to manage. Emollients and topical corticosteroids are the mainstay treatments for eczema. However, they do not treat the underlying cause of the flare-ups frequently seen in the condition; the damaged skin barrier. Defects in the skin barrier arise from premature desquamation of the stratum corneum. The main contributors to barrier breakdown are the up-regulation of skin proteases that are located in the skin. Since zinc is a known protease inhibitor, it would thus follow that a topical treatment for skin barrier repair should be developed. Therefore, the main objectives of this thesis are to successfully incorporate zinc into a formulation to develop a novel class of treatment for eczema and to assess the delivery of the element into the skin. In this thesis, methods to assess and characterise changes to skin barrier function and to extract and quantify zinc in the stratum corneum have been established. The development of two novel topically applied formulations containing zinc lactate as the active ingredient (1% w/w zinc lactate cream and a 2% w/v zinc lactate formulation) has been achieved and the uptake of zinc from the preparations in vitro determined. Further, the in vitro percutaneous penetration of zinc from three commercially available preparations has been investigated and compared to that recovered from the stratum corneum after passive diffusion with the novel zinc formulations. Additionally, in vivo uptake of zinc into human stratum corneum from Sudocremis ® reported. Scanning electron microscopy has revealed the distribution of zinc on the surface of skin treated with various formulations and has also allowed the efficiency of two cleaning procedures to be ascertained. The delivery of zinc from the novel topical formulation; 1% w/w zinc lactate cream, was more efficient than that the three commercial formulations and shows promise as a new approach to treat atopic eczema.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tsang, Manda"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1560453,"sim:weight":0.40617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1581132,"sim:weight":0.339966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2810167,"sim:weight":0.33031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26055,"sim:weight":0.206022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.153239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.141344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.141344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.10256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654159,"sim:weight":0.0883163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0844503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Due to the nature of the site and its surroundings a responsive architectural form was required which could be manipulated to optimise the design for a wide variety of design variables and constraints by accommodating these design changes quickly and easily. This naturally led project architects, Populous, to adopt a parametric approach to generate the form of the building envelope, whereby CAD models were defined using rules and relationships between objects rather than absolute coordinates in space. This architectural parametric model was then passed directly to the structural engineers, Buro Happold, who extended it to include the geometry of the structural members. This paper adds to the body of scientific knowledge by documenting the details of the parametric model created by the author for the structural engineers, including not only the generation of geometry, which incorporates design constraints and embraces structural engineering logic, but is also linked to structural analysis software to provide rapid feedback on the effects of design decisions on structural performance. Furthermore, since this is the first example of a project being designed and built using a single parametric model from architectural design right through to structural analysis, the advantages and challenges of adopting such an approach are discussed. Suggestions are made, based on the lessons learned, to assist those using parametric methods on live projects in the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shepherd, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2811469,"sim:weight":0.514629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This investigation demonstrated that the NR1, NR2D and NR3 subunit proteins are expressed in human platelets, with the NR1 subunit also expressed in MEG-01 cells. The NR2A subunit protein was not detectable in either MEG-01 cells or human platelets. PMA-induced differentiation of MEG-01 cells did not appear to stimulate changes in expression of any of the subunit proteins tested. Using assays to measure the changes in [Ca2+]i and ATP secretion, it was determined that donors could be separated into those who responded to the agonists applied and those who did not; responses also decreased over time in both assays. Human platelets from responding donors demonstrate an increase in [Ca2+]i in response to extracellular glutamate, and that increases in ATP secretion are detected at a 10-fold lower concentration. The same is also true with extracellular glycine. Increases in [Ca2+]i were elicited on the addition of extracellular NMDA; extracellular D-serine had no effect. NMDAR inhibitors, MK-801 and D-AP5, inhibited ATP secretion evoked by either glutamate alone or in combination with glycine. D-serine inhibited responses elicited by extracellular glycine. NMDARs play a role in MK differentiation, with the adhesion of MEG-01 cells cultured on a fibrinogen-surface and differentiated with PMA reduced by both inhibitors. PMA-treated MEG-01 cells increased both in size and irregularity, with the addition of NMDAR-specific inhibitors having no effect. S-nitrosylation also inhibits activation of NMDAR, and a new molecule has been developed which can detect S-nitrosylated proteins through a single step process in live cells. Overall, this study has shown that both human platelets and MEG-01 cells express NMDAR subunits, which have been demonstrated to form functional receptors in human platelets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hobbs, Catherine M"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5842965,"sim:weight":0.330669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87210,"sim:weight":0.288353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573434,"sim:weight":0.242632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.158013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.128117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.11936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this study, we show that mRNAs targeted by NMD are also suppressed at the translational level. The low translational efficiency (TE) is a consequence of multiple features acting in concert, including low translation initiation rate, mediated by 5` secondary structure and by use of weak initiation sites, and low translation elongation speed, mediated by low codon usage bias. Despite low elongation rates, NMD transcripts show low ribosome density in the coding sequence, probably owing to low initiation rates, high abortion rates or rapid transit of the ribosome following initiation failure. The low TE is observed in the absence of NMD and is not explained by low transcript abundance. Translational inefficiency is flexible, such that NMD targets have increased TE upon starvation. We propose that the low TE predisposes to NMD and/or that it is part of a mechanism for regulation of NMD transcripts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhang,  Z. G.","Zhou,  L.","Hu,  L. D.","Zhu,  Y.

The re-use of TV white space is of current interest due to the change to digital transmission in many parts of the world. This has led to the biggest re-structuring of the TV bands since their creation. The bands represent a prime section of spectrum, which currently has some geographical white space. This paper attempts to quantify the number of bands available in the south-west of the UK where digital switch over is now complete.

The measured attenuation was 0.03 dB/mm, over 10 lower than reported with other encapsulants. This enables many nanofibre applications based on their extreme small size and strong external evanescent field, such as optical sensors, nonlinear optics, nanofibre circuits and high-Q resonators.

To this extent, the sector can play an important role in GHG abatement and energy demand reduction, essential objectives of a more ‘sustainable energy system’. Microgeneration, or production of electricity or heat from small-scale sources, have been advocated by some, including the Supergen ‘Highly Distributed Power Systems Consortium’ to which this thesis contributes, as important means towards achieving these objectives. In this thesis, three assessed microgenerators; specifically a 600W microwind system, 2.1 kWp photovoltaic (PV) and building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems, and a 2.8m2 solar hot water (SHW) system have been analysed through an ‘integrated appraisal toolkit’ in order to assess their respective economic and financial performance in current UK context. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is applied, based on outputs and results from energy analysis and life-cycle assessment (LCA), and other tools such as financial appraisal, cost-effective analysis (CEA), and simple multi-attribute ranking technique (SMART) are also performed in order to asses how these systems perform on an individual household level or when compared to other energy technologies. The CBA, which included environmental impacts quantified through the LCA, obtained negative net present values (NPVs) for all the assessed microgenerators with the exception of microwind in a high-wind resourced ‘open’ area with lower end capital costs. The NPVs in the financial appraisal, which excluded environmental impacts, yielded relatively poorer results still. Only with the proposed feed-in tariffs would the systems all achieve positive NPVs. Given that the CBA included a substantial qualitative part, alternative tools, such as CEA and multi-criteria evaluation were applied (in brief) in order to place the assessed systems in the context of other energy generating sources in the UK, and to enable a more confident decision with respect to whether these systems should be advocated or rejected.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harajli, Hassan A"],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The poor are often portrayed as passive recipients of change rather than agents of it and this thesis is a challenge to that. In-depth ethnography and life course analysis help us understand the meanings attached to people’s own experiences of change and illustrate that villagers are not merely ‘forgetting their feet’ (veuaa leum dteen- cows forget their feet, Thai proverb) in a teleological manner but are negotiating adverse structures to provide security and family wellbeing.\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\nAn actor oriented approach is used as it highlights experiences of change and reactions to it whilst also taking into account the adverse political economy and imperfect institutional landscape. Changes that have been happening in one village in North-eastern Thailand are described and the failure of collective forms of resistance to provide adequate security is analysed. The rest of the thesis then goes on to look at change through individual and household strategies. Cohort analysis is used to explore differences in generations. An individual life course approach is then used to show how people strategise for their present and future wellbeing. Intergenerational analysis is also used to understand the bargaining between generations. Findings show the intergenerational contract is not only flexible but is also being re-worked to better fit the changes in society, not necessarily breaking down. Families are evolving and are finding new ways to keep bargains whilst also taking advantage of new identities and lifestyles. Findings show the active negotiation of the rural poor as agents of change; this change is dependent on place and the life course and sometimes entails large tradeoffs but seen in the wider context is supporting the reproduction and survival of families and rural values. \u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\nI argue that perceived ideological similarities between families and the state that families should provide their own welfare without dependency is lessening pressure on the state to increase state welfare.

Therefore, understanding the process of seed development and its regulation has been important to increase production. This has become even more relevant and important as grain production reaches a plateau post green revolution and food security for an ever-increasing population becomes more pressing. This study focuses on altering seed size via manipulation of the endosperm, an important component of the seed that not only nourishes the developing embryo and provides the majority of our food. A classic study done by crossing different ploidies of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) results in changes to endosperm-led growth as a consequence of altered parental genome ratios in the endosperm specifically. Increased paternal contribution results in an enlarged endosperm, and a heavier seed, whereas increased maternal contribution has the opposite effect.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhole genome transcript profiling using microarray analysis of siliques generated by interploidy crosses identified A. thaliana genes namely: PHE1, PHE2, AGL40, AGL62, AGL28, AGL45, CKX2, MAPK10, E2L2, GA1, CYCD4;1, CYCD4;2, GA20OX5, GA-regulated and AT5G46950, that are positively associated with endosperm overgrowth. In order to verify the role of these genes in endosperm proliferation, knock in (KI) which causes gene over-expression and knock out (KO) which results in gene inactivation, strategies were used. Constitutive over-expression of CKX2, MAPK10, and E2L2 showed abnormal vegetative and floral phenotypes, whereas targeted endosperm-specific over-expression of PHE2 and GA1 showed an increase in seed size and/or fertility. KI plants of AGL40, AGL62, AGL45, CYCD4;1, CYCD4;2, GA20OX5, GA-regulated and AT5G46950 did not result in any obvious phenotypic effects under normal growth conditions. KO mutant plants namely: phe1, phe2, agl40, agl62, agl28 and agl45, as single individual mutants were also indistinguishable to wild type plants in non-seed phenotypes. Embryo sac area, individual seed weight and total seed yield data obtained from a phe1 line showed a smaller embryo sac area, lighter seed and reduced total seed yield. Loss of function of agl62 showed precocious endosperm cellularisation and seed lethality. It is nearly impossible to generate phe1/phe2 double mutants due to a very tight linkage between these genes (on the chromosome physically the two genes lie next to each other) and hence doubles, triples and quadruple mutants where appropriate were made with either phe1 or phe2 in combination with other mutant lines of the MADS family of transcription factors. None of the double mutant combination tested had obvious developmental defects. However, the triple mutant phe1/phe1::agl40/agl40 ::agl45/agl45 and the quadruple mutant phe2/phe2::agl40/agl40::agl45/agl45 ::agl28/agl28 showed abnormal embryo and endosperm development which resulted to seed death. This indicates a functional redundancy among these MADS box genes. However, it is unclear how PHE1, PHE2, AGL40, AGL45 and AGL28 act to affect embryo and endosperm development. This result confirms that these genes are positively associated with endosperm over-proliferation as growth promoters and function in some cases as singly or as participants in a complex to control seed development. Thus manipulating expression of genes involved in endosperm development in A. thaliana and the potential use of this knowledge in crop plants provides us with a route to improvement of crop yields.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Bouariky, Ahlam H."],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.2309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.224977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.224977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.213759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24544,"sim:weight":0.170704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26918,"sim:weight":0.161728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton-Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike\u0027s information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike\u0027s information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike\u0027s information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wood, Simon N."],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19412,"sim:weight":0.172508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21258,"sim:weight":0.167074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18442,"sim:weight":0.160458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931407,"sim:weight":0.151678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22852,"sim:weight":0.142134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21493,"sim:weight":0.140818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":240909,"sim:weight":0.134728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.134162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.126606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.121834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26015,"sim:weight":0.113286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5306359,"sim:weight":0.108787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795328,"sim:weight":0.0927476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The loading mode, the thickness of the adherends and adhesive layer, the presence of localised flaws, and the residual stress state within the adhesive layer can all affect the failure strength and energy of an adhesive bond. This means that very similar adhesive bonds may exhibit different failure energies and different loci of failure. This paper reviews some examples from the literature where the introduction of discontinuities at the interface also leads to differences in failure energy and locus of failure. The influence in this way of microporous and microfibrous surface features in anthropogenic adhesive bonds are well-established. More recently, it has been recognised that analogous effects occur in some examples of adhesion in the natural world. The remarkable climbing ability of the gecko depends of a fine state of subdivision at the interface between the animal\u0027s foot and the substrate. Studies of natural adhesion have stimulated the development of biominetic adhesive systems, for example using photoresist technology to produce microfibrous and microporous surfaces.","bibo:AuthorList":["Packham, D.

This process involves three basic stages: capture and compression of CO2 from power stations, transport of CO2, and storage away from the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years. Potential routes for the capture, transport and storage of CO2 from United Kingdom (UK) power plants are examined. Six indicative options are evaluated, based on \u0027Pulverised Coal\u0027, \u0027Natural Gas Combined Cycle\u0027, and \u0027Integrated (coal) Gasification Combined Cycle\u0027 power stations. Chemical and physical CO2 absorption capture techniques are employed with realistic transport possibilities to \u0027Enhanced Oil Recovery\u0027 sites or depleted gas fields in the North Sea. The selected options are quantitatively assessed against well-established economic and energy-related criteria. Results show that CO2 capture can reduce emissions by over 90%. However, this will reduce the efficiency of the power plants concerned, incurring energy penalties between 14 and 30% compared to reference plants without capture. Costs of capture, transport and storage are concatenated to show that the whole CCS chain \u0027cost of electricity\u0027 (COE) rises by 27-142% depending on the option adopted. This is a significant cost increase, although calculations show that the average \u0027cost of CO2 captured\u0027 is 15/tCO2 in 2005 prices [the current base year for official UK producer price indices]. If potential governmental carbon penalties were introduced at this level, then the COE would equate to the same as the reference plant, and make CCS a viable option to help mitigate large-scale climate change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hammond, Geoffrey P","Akwe, Ondo","Williams, S"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The indoor GPS is one of the metrology systems that may be used to provide real-time 6DOF data to a robot controller. Even if there is a noteworthy literature dealing with the evaluation of iGPS performance, there is, however, a lack of literature on how well the iGPS performs under dynamic conditions. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the dynamic measurement performance of the iGPS, tracking the trajectories of an industrial robot. The same experiment is also repeated using a laser tracker. Besides the experiment results presented, this paper also proposes a novel method for dynamic repeatability comparisons of tracking instruments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Zheng","Mastrogiacomo,  Luca","Franceschini,  Fiorenzo","Maropoulos, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, little research has examined the mechanisms by which social capital is formed. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of relational and contractual governance mechanisms on the formation of social capital under varying levels of demand and supply uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual framework is developed, grounded in the literature on supply chain management and social capital theory (SCT). Findings - A series of propositions showed that relational governance leads to the formation of social capital under conditions of supply uncertainty, but is subject to opportunism when customer product demand is uncertain. By contrast, in conditions of high demand uncertainty, contractual governance is associated with social capital formation. Practical implications - The paper illustrates the need for managers to consider both the way in which their choice of governance mechanisms (contractual and relational) contributes to social capital, as well as highlighting the contingent nature of these mechanisms depending on the environmental context. Originality/value - This paper is a novel contribution, applying SCT to the literature on supply chain management.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carey, Sinead","Lawson, Benn"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.290391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652986,"sim:weight":0.232695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.21278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56605,"sim:weight":0.184701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85837,"sim:weight":0.181067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.128685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

By increasing higher education capacity in the Arab Gulf States by over 30,000 places, foreign institutions have, through various forms of transnational provision, increased significantly the accessibility of higher education to young people living in these countries. However, critics of transnational higher education have suggested that it can be seen as the new neocolonialism, which benefits the providers much more than the receivers. This study aims to identify the stakeholders that might benefit from transnational higher education in the Arab Gulf States, and to examine the extent to which those stakeholders are actually benefiting from it. It was found that transnational higher education is playing a large role in the economic, cultural and social development of the Arab Gulf States.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilkins, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The behaviour of large disks (\u003e\u003d 20 mu m diameter) is well described by analytic models that assume a continuous distribution of flux in the sample. Small disks (\u003c\u003d 10 mu m diameter), on the other hand, exhibit clear signatures of the underlying discrete vortex structure as well as competition between triangular \u0027Abrikosov\u0027 ordering and the formation of shell structures driven by interactions with circulating edge currents. At low fields we are able to directly observe the characteristic mesoscopic compression of vortex clusters which is linked to oscillations in the diameter of the vortex \"dome\" in increasing magnetic fields. At higher fields, where single vortex resolution is lost, we are still able to track configurational changes in the vortex patterns, since competing vortex orders impose unmistakable signatures on \u0027local\u0027 magnetisation curves. Our observations are in excellent agreement with molecular-dynamics numerical simulations which lead us to a natural definition of the lengthscale for the crossover between discrete and continuum behaviour in our system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Connolly, Malcolm R.","Bending, Simon J.","Milosevic,  M.

While the role of alpha S in disease is well documented there is currently no agreement on the physiological function of the normal isoform of the protein. Here we provide strong evidence that alpha S is a cellular ferrireductase, responsible for reducing iron (III) to bio available iron (II). The recombinant form of the protein has a V-Max of 2.72 nmols/min/mg and K-m 23 mu M. This activity is also evident in lysates from neuronal cell lines overexpressing alpha S. This activity is dependent on copper bound to alpha S as a cofactor and NADH as an electron donor. Overexpression of alpha-synuclein by cells significantly increases the percentage of iron (II) in cells. The common disease mutations associated with increased susceptibility to PD show no differences in activity or iron (II) levels.

Following a review of existing literature, the authors use a narrative methodology to explore how these people incorporate the experience of job loss into their self-images and identities. They identify certain core similarities in the experiences of unemployed professionals and then discern three narrative strategies through which unemployed professionals tried to make sense of their dismissal and sustain their sense of selfhood. The term \u0027narrative coping\u0027 is proposed as a way of describing each unemployed professional\u0027s struggle to construct a story that offers both meaning and consolation. The study reveals that individuals expressing the most profound despair (those for whom job loss was the \u0027end of the line\u0027) were those whose stories had achieved \u0027closure\u0027. By contrast, most of those who maintained more open-ended narratives were better able to contain their emotions, either by holding on to the belief that unemployment was a temporary career aberration or by abandoning the idea that life is the same as career and by moving on to a new stage of experimentation and bricolage akin to an identity moratorium.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gabriel, Yiannis","Gray,  D.

Labour migration policy and varieties of capitalism in France and Germany","bibo:abstract":"The saliency of international labour migration in the ‘competition state’ and a return to active recruitment across the rich world challenges our understanding of national economic coordination processes. Departing from the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) literature, this paper argues that labour reproduction cannot fully be captured in terms of national vocational education and training systems. Instead, we need to better understand to what extent policy forges foreign labour recruitment as yet another complement in a wider macro-economic competitiveness strategy. Evidence from document and interview analyses in France and Germany provokes ambivalent answers to this exploration. With regard to the beneficial treatment of high and specific skills entries, selection mechanisms for extra-EU migrant workers are clearly shaped by nationally distinct competitiveness strategies and narratives. They epitomise the aspirations of the ‘competition state’ bearing distinct characteristics of state-enhanced French and enabling German capitalism par excellence. The sectoral locus of foreign recruitment decisions in both countries and the specific German fixation on VET qualifications in admissions further follow well-studied economic coordination patterns. However, limits to non-EU labour entries for lower skills enforce a highly differential rights regime compared to high skilled entries. We observe a strong political demarcation of the ‘competition state’ logics in skilled and lower skilled segments, noticeably departing from orthodox economic coordination claims. This rests on a political imagination of a self-sufficient resident pool of labour, contained by domestic activation policy targets, EU free movement of labour, and, very distinctly in France, the management of a post-colonial resident population.","bibo:AuthorList":["Paul, Regine"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.263167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.255784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.203466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thus, organisations seek practical approaches to protect the operation of the business. Protecting the functionality of an organisation is a difficult task but it is the responsibility of both senior management and ISS functions to do so. An analysis of the ISS literature reveals a paucity of research of ISS management, and a need for research to develop a holistic model for managing ISS knowledge to overcome the ever-increasing number of negative security incidents. The ISS research community is restrained by small-scale technical questions as the social aspects of ISS are ignored resulting in fragmented research across the IS field. While several possible methods are scattered throughout the literature – they focus on the development of information systems. ISS professionals require a range of skills encompassing business knowledge, legal awareness, and organisational processes as well as technical security knowledge. Research to date has failed to provide an integrated approach to managing ISS knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis study investigates how ISS could leverage the concept of knowledge management. It proposes a theoretical model derived from the ISS and KM literatures. Thus to address this gap in research, this study adopts an exploratory interpretive holistic case study approach using interviews and document analysis as data gathering methods. The study will focus on the relationship between ISS and KM and the proposed benefits that an ISS KM initiative would produce. An analysis of the approaches used by these specialised structures in managing knowledge within and across the two case studies facilitated the development of an integrated model. The interplay between the functions provided rich description of the approaches used to manage knowledge. This research builds on previous studies documented in the ISS literature, by providing a much needed model against which practitioners may diagnose problems, plan action and implement solutions. ISS models and standards today do not exhibit much flexibility, therefore managers make ISS decisions in a vacuum. ISS problems can be managed or reduced when the ISS functions and management are aware of the full range of controls available and implement the most effective. Unfortunately, they often lack this knowledge and their subsequent actions to cope with threats are less effective.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe focus of ISS research to date has been technical and grounded in positivism and few, if any, studies utilise a qualitative approach, therefore eliminating holistic, in-depth rich descriptions of core issues within the field.

This study acknowledges these issues and provides a solid conceptual foundation for future studies on ISS by answering calls for a theoretical model to guide research in the area.

Nonetheless, the role played by XOR during inflammation is poorly understood. We previously observed that inhibition of XOR within the inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) prevented neutrophil recruitment during adoptive transfer demonstrating the role of XOR in MNP-mediated neutrophil recruitment. To further explore the role of XOR in the inflammatory state of MNP, we studied MNP isolated from inflammatory lungs combined with analyses of MNP cell lines. We demonstrated that XOR activity was increased in inflammatory MNP following insufflation of Th-1 cytokines in vivo and that activity was specifically increased by MNP differentiation. Inhibition of XOR reduced levels of CINC-1 secreted by MNP. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) in purified rat lung MNP and MNP cell lines reflected both the presence of PPAR gamma isoforms and PPAR gamma SUMOylation, and XOR inhibitors increased levels of SUMO-PPAR gamma in MNP cell lines. Both ectopic overexpression of XOR cDNA and uric acid supplementation reduced SUMO-PPAR gamma in MNP cells. Levels of the M2 markers CD36, CD206, and arginase-1 were modulated by uric acid and oxonic acid, whereas siRNA to SUMO-1 or PIAS-1 also reduced arginase-1 in RAW264.7 cells. We also observed that HIF-1 alpha was increased by XOR inhibitors in inflammatory MNP and in MNP cell lines. These data demonstrate that XOR promotes the inflammatory state of MNP through effects on chemokine expression, PPAR gamma SUMOylation, and HIF-1 alpha and suggest that strategies for inhibiting XOR may be valuable in modulating lung inflammatory disorders.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gibbings,  S.","Elkins,  N.

Their exclusion can degrade the overall satellite geometry for the calculations, resulting in greater errors; an effect known as the Dilution of Precision (DOP). In contrast, signals from high elevation satellites experience less ionospheric delays and multipath effects. The aim is to find a balance in the choice of elevation mask, to reduce the propagation delays and multipath whilst maintaining good satellite geometry, and to use tomography to correct for the ionosphere and thus improve single-frequency GPS timing accuracy. GPS data, collected from a global network of dual-frequency GPS receivers, have been used to produce four GPS timing solutions, each with a different ionospheric compensation technique. One solution uses a 4D tomographic algorithm, Multi-Instrument Data Analysis System (MIDAS), to compensate for the ionospheric delay. Maps of ionospheric electron density are produced and used to correct the single-frequency pseudorange observations. This method is compared to a dual-frequency solution and two other single-frequency solutions: one does not include any ionospheric compensation and the other uses the broadcast Klobuchar model. Data from the solar maximum year 2002 and October 2003 have been investigated to display results when the ionospheric delays are large and variable. The study focuses on Europe and results are produced for the chosen test site, VILL (Villafranca, Spain). The effects of excluding all of the GPS satellites below various elevation masks, ranging from 5 degrees to 40 degrees, on timing solutions for fixed (static) and mobile (moving) situations are presented. The greatest timing accuracies when using the fixed GPS receiver technique are obtained by using a 40 degrees mask, rather than a 5 degrees mask. The mobile GPS timing solutions are most accurate when satellites at lower elevations continue to be included: using a mask between 10 degrees and 20 degrees. MIDAS offers the most accurate and least variable single-frequency timing solution and accuracies to within 10 ns are achieved for fixed GPS receiver situations. Future improvements are anticipated by combining both GPS and Galileo data towards computing a timing solution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rose, Julian A.

We detect the collective and localized spin-wave modes of the grating by measuring the photovoltage and the photoresistance induced in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The magnetic excitations couple to the 2DEG through their stray magnetic field. We perform a spectroscopy of dipolar-exchange spin waves as a function of microwave power, temperature, the tilt angle of the applied magnetic field, and by varying the structural and material parameters to change the strength of dipolar interactions. The data reveal two types of spin waves. Dipolar magnetization waves propagate across the grating through the magnetostatic interaction between the stripes. We derive an analytical expression of their dispersion curve and obtain a good fit of the ferromagnetic resonance broadening from first principles. The second type is dipolar edge spin waves which manifest through a series of sharp resonances at lower magnetic field. These waves are confined near the pole surfaces and interact very little with neighboring stripes.

To some, it is simply a measure of the standing genetic variation in a population and can be captured by the narrow-sense heritability (h(2)). To others, evolvability refers to the capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation. Many scientists, including Darwin, have argued that environmental variation can generate heritable phenotypic variation. However, their theories have been difficult to test. Recent theory on the evolution of sex and recombination provides a much simpler framework for evaluating evolvability. It shows that modifiers of recombination can increase in prevalence whenever low fitness individuals produce proportionately more recombinant offspring. Because recombination can generate heritable variation, stress-induced recombination might be a plausible mechanism of evolvability if populations exhibit a negative relationship between fitness and recombination. Here we use the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to test for this relationship. We exposed females to mating stress, heat shock or cold shock and measured the temporary changes that occurred in reproductive output and the rate of chromosomal recombination. We found that each stress treatment increased the rate of recombination and that heat shock, but not mating stress or cold shock, generated a negative relationship between reproductive output and recombination rate. The negative relationship was absent in the low-stress controls, which suggests that fitness and recombination may only be associated under stressful conditions. Taken together, these findings suggest that stress-induced recombination might be a mechanism of evolvability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhong,  W.

Surface shear stress clearly is an important parameter. CFD simulation of fluid flow in a tube fitted with a hiTRAN insert reveals a complex distribution of surface shear stress. To compare the insert situation with the bare tube, an equivalent velocity concept is introduced on the basis that at a given average velocity the fluid flow results in the same average wall shear stress regardless of whether the tube is bare or is fitted with an insert. Using the equivalent velocity concept, the fouling data obtained using both a bare tube and a tube fitted with inserts can be correlated using a single model. Moreover, the fouling threshold conditions below which fouling is negligible, can be predicted for both situations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yang, Mengyan","Crittenden, Barry"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1651854,"sim:weight":0.170556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85046,"sim:weight":0.146784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.142827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108096,"sim:weight":0.1342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26618,"sim:weight":0.131284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29322,"sim:weight":0.117473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Gap-based and perceptions-only approaches to measuring ISQ are tested and their respective benefits and limitations evaluated. Design/methodology/approach - The internal service context used in this study is the provision of e-procurement software, training, and user support in four organisations. The two approaches are evaluated in terms of reliability and validity, as well as pragmatic aspects of survey administration. Findings - The various tests carried out indicate that both the gap-measure and perceptions-only measure are reliable and valid, the latter being the marginally higher performer. Both approaches were found to have benefits and limitations, and so the empirical study, combined with contributions from the literature, generates some understanding of the internal service context in which the two approaches might be appropriate. Research limitations/implications - The survey was based on an internal e-procurement service; as such, the variables and dimensions selected to measure ISQ in this context inevitably limit the scope of the research. Practical implications For operations managers, the paper clarifies the basis on which they might choose between the two approaches to ISQ measurement. Originality/value - This study is the first to directly test and compare the relative merits of these two approaches to ISQ measurement. The paper also offers insights as to the operational contexts in which each approach might be appropriate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brandon-Jones, Alistair","Silvestro, R"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58406,"sim:weight":0.227448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.206038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53666,"sim:weight":0.192912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.177367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930474,"sim:weight":0.132792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The major difference between them is in the way they evaluate the costs imposed by network users. The former calculates network charges through simulation and the latter derives charges with a sensitivity- based analytical approach. Both charging models aim to send cost-reflective economic signals to customers, providing an economic climate for the cost-effective development of networks. In this paper, a novel long-run marginal cost (LRMC) pricing methodology based on analytical method is proposed to reflect the impacts on the long-run costs imposed by a nodal injection through sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis consists of three partial differentiations: 1) the sensitivity of circuit power flow with respect to nodal power increment, 2) the sensitivity of the time to reinforce network with respect to changes in circuit power flows, and 3) the sensitivity of present value of future reinforcement with respect to changes in time to reinforce. Two test systems are employed to illustrate the principles and implementation of the proposed method. Results from incremental and marginal approaches under different system conditions are compared and contrasted in terms of charges and tariffs. The proposed method, as demonstrated in the test systems, can produce forward-looking charges that reflect the extent of network utilization levels in addition to the distance that power must travel from points of generation to points of consumption. Furthermore, the proposed method is able to provide further insights into factors influencing network charges.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gu, C H","Li, F R"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1579347,"sim:weight":0.554616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108846,"sim:weight":0.384225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108453,"sim:weight":0.324981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.291144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84850,"sim:weight":0.272473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108345,"sim:weight":0.27144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.25727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.2527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.23625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its application to an annular geometry across a range of possible flow conditions, from stagnant to turbulent flow regimes (annulus Reynolds number similar to 29,000), is demonstrated. Two modes of measurement are demonstrated: in the first, the pressure drop across the nozzle is fixed and the mass flow rate of liquid withdrawn through the gauge is measured. In the second, the mass flow rate of liquid is fixed and the pressure drop measured: the latter is a new mode of measurement and it is shown to perform equally well, with advantages for particular applications. The results were not affected significantly by the surface under study being heated, indicating that the technique is suitable for measuring deposit thicknesses in situ during fouling and cleaning experiments in annular devices which are commonly used in deposition studies. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which afford detailed information about the flow patterns and shear stresses imposed on the surface, showed good agreement with experimental data for tests in the laminar regime: simulation of the transitional and turbulent regimes was not attempted. A short study of whey protein fouling recorded mixed success owing to the softness of the deposit, but demonstrated the scope for FDG to monitor the development of fouling layers in these geometries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gu, T","Albert, F","Augustin, W","Chew, Yong Min","Mayer, M","Paterson, W R","Scholl, S","Sheikh, I","Wang, K","Wilson, D I"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2810055,"sim:weight":0.351255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58133,"sim:weight":0.327223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651854,"sim:weight":0.316072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.260214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.222543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9563,"sim:weight":0.203797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85046,"sim:weight":0.194759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85528,"sim:weight":0.165944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We show that every ordinary natural transformation between 2-functors whose domain 2-category has either tensors or cotensors with the arrow category is 2-natural. We use that to prove that an ordinary monad, or endofunctor, on such a 2-category has at most one enrichment over Cat or Gpd. We also describe a monad on Cat that has no enrichment. So enrichment over Cat is a non-trivial property of a monad rather than a structure that is additional to it.

This research brings together the literatures of virtuality and the virtual organisation, leadership and higher education management to interrogate the effect of virtuality on leadership styles within the volatile global higher education environment caused by the liberalisation of the sector. Through a case study of a higher education institution (HEI) that is developing a virtual campus, the research explores the perceptions of leadership skills, competencies and behaviours within the virtual higher education environment to determine whether a new model or framework can be developed for a virtual and widely distributed environment. The data from interviews, surveys and focus groups carried out in the case study show that virtuality does impact leadership skills in nuanced ways, thus proposing a configuration of behaviours, skills and competencies more relevant to the virtual higher education environment. The proposed framework adds to the literature on leadership in higher education as well as leadership in the virtual environment and contributes to practice in the areas of recruitment and training of leaders and managers in the virtual higher education sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Longsworth, Luz M"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This article considers Poland and the UK together, as two ends of the same migration arc. It explores some ways in which Polish migrants to the UK experience place attachment and construct local identities, both in the UK and Poland, using a livelihood strategy approach to understand why they feel rooted in just one location per country. People often migrate from Poland because of specific conditions in their home town or village; they migrate to specific places abroad where they have friends and family; in the UK, they maintain ties with specific places in Poland, which they return to visit on holiday; and, if they return to Poland to live and work, they are likely to settle in their places of origin. In their UK location, they frequently feel a sense of local belonging even if they have little contact with the non-Polish population, and lead very Polish lives. Their UK home towns are viewed as places where they can realise livelihood aspirations developed in Poland. Locality is therefore in some contexts more important than ethnicity. Too much emphasis can be placed on the role of ethnicity and national belonging in the lives of migrants, and ‘translocal’ is sometimes a more helpful label than ‘transnational’ to describe the lifestyles of Polish labour migrants in the UK.","bibo:AuthorList":["White, Anne"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is found that the information radiated into the field is limited, with the limit fixed by the wavenumber of the source multiplied by the source radius (Helmholtz number). The acoustic field is found in terms of the elementary fields generated by a set of line sources whose form is given by Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and whose amplitude is found to be given by weighted integrals of the radial source term. The analysis is developed for tonal sources, such as rotors, and for Helmholtz number less than two, for random disk sources. In this case, the analysis yields the cross-spectrum between two points in the acoustic field. The analysis is applied to the problems of tonal radiation, random source radiation as a model problem for jet noise, and to noise cancellation, as in active control of noise from rotors. It is found that the approach gives an accurate model for the radiation problem and explicitly identifies those parts of a source which radiate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carley, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27116,"sim:weight":0.393867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8746976,"sim:weight":0.374618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88287,"sim:weight":0.372775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24050,"sim:weight":0.371099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24691,"sim:weight":0.341543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22980,"sim:weight":0.324025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26766,"sim:weight":0.291946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23830,"sim:weight":0.290517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26618,"sim:weight":0.289472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27842,"sim:weight":0.286867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28998,"sim:weight":0.284588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269860,"sim:weight":0.283045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.279912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269868,"sim:weight":0.267497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27143,"sim:weight":0.260969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26098,"sim:weight":0.252383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108148,"sim:weight":0.250356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23914,"sim:weight":0.249377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1487803,"sim:weight":0.245346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24687,"sim:weight":0.233474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Little is known about the worldwide variation in incidence of primary glomerulonephritis (GN). The objective of this review was to critically appraise studies of incidence published in 1980-2010 so that an overall view of trends of these diseases can be found. This would provide important information for determining changes in rates and understanding variations between countries.\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\u003cp\u003eMethods. All relevant papers found through searches of Medline, Embase and ScienceDirect were critically appraised and an assessment was made of the reliability of the reported incidence data.\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\u003cp\u003eResults. This review includes 40 studies of incidence of primary GN from Europe, North and South America, Canada, Australasia and the Middle East. Rates for the individual types of disease were found to be in adults, 0.2/100 000/year for membrano-proliferative GN, 0.2/100 000/year for mesangio-proliferative GN, 0.6/100 000/year for minimal change disease, 0.8/100 000/year for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 1.2/100 000/year for membranous nephropathy and 2.5/100 000/year for IgA nephropathy. Rates were lower in children at around 0.1/100 000/year with the exception of minimal change disease where incidence was reported to be 2.0/100 000/year in Caucasian children with higher rates in Arabian children (9.2/100 000/year) and Asian children (6.2-15.6/100 000/year).\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\u003cp\u003eConclusions. This study found that incidence rates of primary GN vary between 0.2/100 000/year and 2.5/100 000/ year. The incidence of IgA nephropathy is at least 2.5/100 000/year in adults; this disease can exist subclinically and is therefore only detected by chance in some patients.

In Experiment 1, 36 participants were allocated to low, medium, and high access cost conditions and completed a problem-solving version of the Blocks World Task. Both the nature of planning (memory based or display based) and its timing (before or during action) changed with high goal-state access cost (a mouse movement and a 2.5-s delay). In this condition more planning before action was observed, with less planning during action, evidenced by longer first-move latencies, more moves per goal-state inspection, and more short (0.8 s) and long (8 s) opreplannedo intermove latencies. Experiment 2 used an eight-puzzle-like transformation task and replicated the effect of goal-state access cost when more complex planning was required, also confirmed by sampled protocol data. Planning before an episode of move making increased with higher goal-state access cost, and planning whilst making moves increased with lower access cost. These novel results are discussed in the context of the soft constraints hypothesis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Waldron,  S.

Bell clearly intended his intervention as a wake-up call for reporters, implied in accusations of misreporting during the Gulf War of 1991, and he insisted that reporters must be reflexive about their role in the conflict. It is argued here that Bell\u0027s attempt at defining the reporter as moral witness overlooks the specific responsibility of the reporter as secondary witness to the conflict. Taking the example of the German reporter Marina Achenbach, this article examines her reporting from Bosnia as an example of how journalists can be reflexive in their writing without abandoning the attempt to represent another culture. Influenced by post-colonial writing, it shows how Achenbach successfully forced her readers to reflect not only on their own role in the conflict but also on the ways in which this war changed them.","bibo:AuthorList":["von Oppen, Karoline"],"dc:date":"2009-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.247758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930627,"sim:weight":0.215006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.19665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.195802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.188945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108960,"sim:weight":0.161975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29421,"sim:weight":0.12661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We first discuss the physical origins of two theories for the derivation of friction coefficients used in rate-and-state models, both derived from thermally activated rate processes. Secondly, we propose a general expression for the state evolution law in the form of a first order kinetics which describes the relaxation to a velocity dependent equilibrium interfacial state {symbol}ss (v) over a velocity dependent dynamic rejuvenation time-scale t{symbol} (v). We show that the unknown relation {symbol}ss (v), defined as the ratio of t{symbol} to a constant interfacial stationary healing time-scale t* *, can be estimated directly from the experimental measurements of the steady-state friction coefficient and the critical stiffness for the onset of stick-slip behaviour of a spring-block system. Using a specific experimental dataset, we finally illustrate that this method provides the experimental measurements of the apparent memory length La (v) \u003d v t* * {symbol}ss (v) and the constant characteristic relaxation time t* * from which a constant intrinsic memory length L \u003d V* t* * can be defined once a slip rate of reference V* is chosen.

Unfortunately, the ubiquitous IC technology, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), does not meet the first of these requirements. For devices intended only for research, modification of CMOS by post-processing using cleanroom facilities has been achieved by others. However, to enable adoption of CMOS as a basis for commercial biosensors, the economies of scale of CMOS fabrication must be maintained by using only low-cost post-processing techniques. The scope of this work was to develop post-processing methods that meet the electrochemical and biocompatibility requirements but within the low-cost constraint. Several approaches were appraised with the two most promising designs taken forward for further investigation. Firstly, a process was developed whereby the corrodible aluminium is anodised to form nanoporous alumina and further processed to optimise its impedance. A second design included a noble metal in the alumina pores to enhance further the electrical characteristics of the electrode. Experiments demonstrated for the first time the ability to anodise CMOS metallisation to form the desired electrodes. Tests showed the electrode addressed the problems of corrosion and presented a surface that was biocompatible with the NG108-15 neuronal cell line. Difficulties in assessing the influence of alumina porosity led to the development of a novel cell adhesion assay that showed for the first time neuronal cells adhere preferentially to large pores rather than small pores or planar aluminium. It was also demonstrated that porosity can be manipulated at room temperature by modifying the anodising electrolyte with polyethylene glycol. CMOS ICs were designed as multiple electrode arrays and optimised for neuronal recordings. This utilised the design incorporating a noble metal deposited into the porous alumina. Deposition of platinum was only partially successful, with better results using gold. This provided an electrode surface suitable for electric cell-substrate impedance sensors (ECIS) and many other sensor applications. Further processing deposited platinum black to improve signal-to-noise ratio for neuronal recordings. The developed processes require no specialised semiconductor fabrication equipment and can process CMOS ICs on laboratory or factory bench tops in less than one hour. During the course of electrode development, new methods for biosensor packaging were assessed: firstly, a biocompatible polyethylene glycol mould process was developed for improved prototype assembly. Secondly, a commercial ‘partial encapsulation’ process (Quik-Pak, U.S.) was assessed for biocompatibility. Cell vitality tests showed both methods were biocompatible and therefore suitable for use in cell-based biosensors. The post-processed CMOS electrode arrays were demonstrated by successfully recording neuronal cell electrical activity (action potentials) and by ECIS with a human epithelial cell line (Caco2). It is evident that these developments may provide a missing link that can enable commercialisation of CMOS biosensors.

At four temperatures studied (20-37 degrees C), the presence of PEG decreased the rate of solute transfer both into and out of the organic phase in a concentration-dependent fashion. The bulk partition coefficient of the solute (organic/aqueous) increased with increasing PEG in the aqueous phase. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the interfacial transfer kinetics allowed thermodynamic activation energy parameters for the phase transport process to be determined. Although the free energy of activation (Delta G(not equal)) for transfer was not affected by PEG, the relative enthalpic and entropic contributions were dramatically altered. At PEG concentrations of 10-40% v/v the enthalpic portion of Delta G(not equal) was decreased by about a factor of two, while the entropic contribution (which is large and positively favorable in the absence of PEG) was reduced considerable such that it was totally eliminated at higher PEG levels. These observations suggest novel and direct experimental evidence for the concept that high PEG concentrations substantially alter water structure at an aqueous solution-organic liquid biomembrane model interface. The results support the hypothesis that the critically important function of PEG in inducing cell-cell and liposome-liposome fusion is to remove the hydration layer that impedes the close apposition of converging phospholipid bilayers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guy, Richard H","Szoka, F C"],"dc:date":"2011-03-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108054,"sim:weight":0.16475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53848,"sim:weight":0.160044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108488,"sim:weight":0.159938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.151058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.14596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109207,"sim:weight":0.142755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26627,"sim:weight":0.136136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.126595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795349,"sim:weight":0.126245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24739,"sim:weight":0.119523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340647,"sim:weight":0.0811665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The results indicate that the photocurrent onset potential is strongly affected by Fermi level pinning since the rate constant for surface recombination is almost constant in this potential region. The phenomenological rate constant for electron transfer was found to increase with potential, suggesting that the potential drop in the Helmholtz layer influences the activation energy for the oxygen evolution process.

This thesis describes the use of computer modelling techniques to study point defects, dopants and clustering effects in fluorite-and perovskitetype\r\nion conductors with potential SOFC applications. Bi2O3 related phases are being developed with the objective of high oxide-ion conductivities at lower operating\r\ntemperatures than 1000°C, as in current generation SOFC electrolytes. Doped Bi2O3 phases have shown promise as materials capable of accomplishing this goal. First, the Y-doped phase, Bi3YO6, has been investigated including the ordering of intrinsic vacancies. The defect and dopant characteristics of Bi3YO6 have been examined and show that a highly mobile oxygen sub-lattice exists in this material. A preliminary structural modelling study of a new Re-doped Bi2O3 phase was also undertaken. A comprehensive investigation of the proton-conducting perovskites BaZrO3, BaPrO3 and BaThO3 is then presented. Our results suggest that intrinsic\r\natomic disorder in BaZrO3 and BaThO3 is unlikely, but reduction of Pr4+ in BaPrO3 is favourable. The water incorporation energy is found to be less exothermic\r\nfor BaZrO3 than for BaPrO3 and BaThO3, but in all cases the results suggest that the proton concentration would decrease with increasing temperature, in accord\r\nwith experimental data. The high binding energies for all the dopant-OH pair clusters in BaPrO3 and BaThO3 suggest strong proton trapping effects. Finally, a study of multiferroic BiFeO3 is presented, in which the defect, dopant and migration\r\nproperties of this highly topical phase are investigated. The reduction process involving the formation of oxygen vacancies and Fe2+ is the most favourable redox process. In addition, the results suggest that oxide-ion migration is anisotropic within this system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stokes, Stephen J."],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108606,"sim:weight":0.231849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25014,"sim:weight":0.190341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108676,"sim:weight":0.123111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Numerical values for surface energies may be obtained either from contact angle measurements or from analysing force-displacement curves obtained from the surface forces apparatus. The extent to which the relationships, appropriate for plane surfaces, may be modified to take into account interfacial roughness are discussed. For modest extents of roughness, the application of a simple roughness factor may be satisfactory, but this is unrealistic for many of the practical surfaces of relevance to adhesive technology which are very rough, and is ultimately meaningless, if the surface is fractal in nature. Some examples are discussed of published work involving polymer-metal and polymer-polymer adhesion, where the roughness of the interface exerts a significant influence on the adhesion obtained. Roughness over a range of scales from microns to nanometres may strengthen an interface, increasing fracture energy by allowing bulk energy dissipating processes to be activated when the bond is stressed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Packham, David E."],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60984,"sim:weight":0.343085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26309,"sim:weight":0.306085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108077,"sim:weight":0.299663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584831,"sim:weight":0.209574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.20494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.203333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821123,"sim:weight":0.182693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Traditionally, Thai policy making is referred as ‘a bureaucratic polity’ and being ‘bifurcated’ between clientalistic sectoral policy situated in line ministries and autonomous macroeconomic policy located around the Bank of Thailand, Ministry of Finance, National Economic and Social Development Board, and the Bureau of Budget. This thesis argues that these prevailing conceptual frameworks, although having contributed important knowledge in the Thai case, are not adequate in explaining the change in the policy configuration over the period in question due to their inability to capture the dynamic and complex interplay within macroeconomic policy making. To overcome these shortcomings, this thesis builds on Rangsun’s framework by introducing a more dynamic framework and integrating three main theoretical strands on the nature of policy making, namely the state-centred, society-centred, and international perspectives to explain the complex relationship among all actors involved in the Thai policy-making arena. This thesis finds that as Thailand has experienced fundamental changes that have occurred in the domestic politics and socioeconomic landscape since the late 1980s, the roles of new actors in the realm of policy making, including political parties, elected politicians, businessmen, and international actors have been significantly enhanced. As a result, the nature of the economic policy-making process has emerged as being influenced by different forces, both domestic and international, as well as being constrained by the superstructure and institutions such as constitution, political regime, pattern of the world economy and social relations. More importantly, the process of policy making is not static, but dynamic, and is also highly complex, varying according to time and context. Furthermore, this thesis contends that the political economy of policy making is a dialectic process in which the meaning and interpretation of policy are themselves important sites of contestation over the policy-making process between contending power blocs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Painmanakul, Arissara"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.292331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.255266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.224897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For models of faceting, the anisotropy is typically such that the functional becomes nonconvex, and then it may be appropriate to regularize it with an additional term involving curvature. When the weight of the curvature term tends to 0, this gives rise to a singular perturbation problem. The structure of this problem is comparable to the theory of phase transitions studied first by Modica and Mortola. Their ideas are also use- ful in this context, but they have to be combined with adequate geometric tools. In particular, a variant of the theory of curvature varifolds, intro- duced by Hutchinson, is used in this paper.

Smoking remains the single largest preventable cause of death, accounting for over 80,000 deaths in England in 2008. One in two smokers who do not quit will eventually die prematurely from a smoking related disease. Smoking not only puts smokers at risk but also those around them due to exposure to second hand smoke (SHS). SHS is carcinogenic to humans and contains a number of toxins. Scientific evidence accumulated over a number of years has shown that exposure to SHS causes death, disease and disability. In order to reduce the risks associated with SHS exposure, the 2006\r\nHealth Act prohibited smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces in England. This smoke-free legislation, implemented in on July 1st 2007, was primarily intended to protect the public and workers from SHS. However, research\r\nin other countries has shown that smoke-free legislation can also influence smoking behaviour. It was therefore anticipated that the introduction of smoke-free could encourage more smokers to try and quit, and that in turn some of these might access England’s free at the point of use cessation services – National Health Service (NHS) stop smoking services (SSSs). This research aimed to explore the implications of the smoke-free legislation in England for NHS SSSs. It explored the capacity of SSSs to respond to any change in service uptake that resulted from the new legislation, to understand the impact of the legislation on smoking behaviour, and to highlight implications for policy and practice.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003eMethods\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\nFive inter-related pieces of research were conducted. Two national surveys of English SSS co-ordinators were carried out pre (n\u003d132, 77 %) and post (n\u003d86, 57 %) legislation. These explored the structure and function of the services, their funding and staffing, service delivery and training, preparation for smoke-free and ability to cope with any increase in demand. Comparative analysis of the two surveys was conducted. In-depth semi-structured interviews with 14 service staff and 17 clients allowed for the services and smoke-free legislation to be examined from these two key perspectives. Staff interviews explored career paths, training and the provision of smoking cessation support, whilst clients discussed the experience of attending the service and their smoking behaviour, as well as attitudes towards and experiences of smoke-free for both groups. Finally, data from 10,560 interviews, resulting from collaborative research with colleagues at University College London (UCL), explored intentions to quit smoking and quit attempts in response to smoke-free.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eFindings\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\nKey findings and conclusions are grouped into four main headings: stop smoking structure and development; SSS response to smoke-free; relationships between smoke-free legislation and smoking cessation; and smoke-free and the smoker. Findings on service structure and development highlighted considerable variation in relation to service management and staffing. A shift in service delivery methods\r\n(from group-based treatment to one to one interventions) was noted compared with previous research. Services were also increasingly aiming to reach and treat disadvantaged groups. Staff were committed to their role in helping people stop smoking but pointed to a lack of training and promotion opportunities, that pose challenges for the future development of services. In relation to smoke-free\r\nlegislation, most services actively prepared for the introduction of the new law and almost all anticipated that their client numbers would increase as a result. Comparisons between the pre and post legislation surveys showed that more clients did access the services, although this increase was smaller than anticipated. Few services received additional funding to cope with higher client numbers. Analysis of a large survey dataset of smokers in England showed that a significantly higher percentage of smokers reported making a quit attempt in July and August 2007 compared with the same period the following year. This increase in quit attempts coincided with the implementation of the legislation and was equivalent to over 300,000 smokers trying to quit in response to the introduction of\r\nsmoke-free. This increase in quit attempts was not, however, sustained beyond the initial period following smoke-free and important questions remain about the longer term impact of the law on smoking rates in England. Qualitative interviews with smokers who were trying to make a quit attempt with the support of the SSS provide further information about how the legislation affected smoking behaviour and attitudes. There were initially mixed attitudes towards the new law before it was introduced but following the legislation most smokers were positive about the change, a finding that is reflected in other recent research in England. Smokers did, however, demonstrate feelings of cognitive dissonance which resulted in their\r\nchanging attitudes. Some reported a change in cigarette consumption and others did quit. Recommendations for policy and practice emerge from the research. These include the importance of early and substantial preparation for smoke-free, maximising the potential for more smokers to quit during implementation of the policy, investment in SSSs to secure their future and maintaining and further developing the relationship between available support to help smokers quit and other wider tobacco control policies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hackshaw, Lucy E"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109025,"sim:weight":0.215485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.212479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.19701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.196051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For example, photovoltaic cells and small wind turbines can be coupled with energy storage systems such as batteries. Used effectively, battery storage can increase the versatility of a micro-generation system by satisfying the highly variable electrical load of an individual dwelling, therefore changing usage patterns on the national grid (Jenkins et al 2008). In addition, a significant shift towards electric or hybrid cars would also increase the number of batteries required. However, batteries can be inefficient and comprise of materials that have high environmental and energy impacts. In addition, some materials, such as lithium, are scarce natural resources. As a result, the overall impact of increasing our reliance on such “sustainable” systems may in fact have an additional detrimental impact. This paper outlines previous work in this area, and reviews the data available about battery production and use in terms of their life cycle environmental and energy impacts. Problems associated with resource availability are also highlighted. The impact of the production of batteries is examined and presented in order that future studies may be able to include the impact of batteries more easily within any system.","bibo:AuthorList":["McManus, Marcelle"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":33709,"sim:weight":0.376201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28485,"sim:weight":0.365961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931857,"sim:weight":0.287609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15244,"sim:weight":0.260583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1511648,"sim:weight":0.254669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.233957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386659,"sim:weight":0.230603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, LTD is difficult to induce in adult cortex for reasons that are not known. Here we show that LTD can be readily induced in adult cortex by the activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs), after inhibition of glutamate uptake. Interestingly there is no need to activate synaptic NMDARs to induce this LTD, suggesting that LTD is triggered primarily by extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. We also find that de novo LTD requires the activation of NR2B-containing NMDAR, whereas LTP requires activation of NR2A-containing NMDARs. Surprisingly another form of LTD, depotentiation, requires activation of NR2A-containing NMDARs. Therefore, NMDARs with different synaptic locations and subunit compositions are involved in various forms of synaptic plasticity in adult cortex.","bibo:AuthorList":["Massey, Peter V","Johnson, B E","Moult, P R","Auberson, Y P","Brown, M W","Molnar, E","Collingridge, G L","Bashir, Z I"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":87210,"sim:weight":0.372658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81250,"sim:weight":0.192213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We assess whether the mechanisms used in alternative forms of plasticity, long-term depression (LTD) and depotentiation, play a role in learning. We have exploited the involvement of the perirhinal cortex in two different forms of learning to compare simultaneously, within the same brain region, their effects on LTD and depotentiation. Multiple-exposure learning but not single-exposure learning in vivo prevented, in a muscarinic receptor-dependent manner, subsequent induction of LTD and depotentiation, but not LTP, in perirhinal cortex in vitro. The contrast in the effects of the two types of learning under these particular experimental conditions indicate that the in vitro change is unlikely to be attributable to synapse-specific plastic changes registering the precise details of the individual learned associations. Instead, it is concluded that the lack of LTD and depotentiation arises from, and establishes the importance of, a learning-related generalized change in plasticity gain. The existence of this additional mechanism has important implications for interpretations of how plasticity relates to learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Massey, Peter V","Phythian, D","Narduzzo, K","Warburton, E C","Brown, M W","Bashir, Z I"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85454,"sim:weight":0.285013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.151657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268784,"sim:weight":0.126518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.118457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81250,"sim:weight":0.0963259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The proposed analytical methodology offers rapid analysis for a large number of compounds, with low limits of quantification and utilises only one solid-phase extraction-ultra performance liquid chromatography-positive electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) method, thus overcoming the drawbacks of previously published procedures. The method employed solid phase extraction with the usage of Oasis MCX sorbent and subsequent ultra performance liquid chromatography-positive electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. The usage of a 1.7 mu m particle size column (1 mm x 150 mm) resulted in very low flow rates (0.04 mL min(-1)), and as a consequence gave good sensitivity, low mobile phase consumption and short retention times for all compounds (from 2.9 to 23.1 min). High SPE recoveries (\u003e60%) were obtained for the majority of compounds. The mean correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were typically higher than 0.997 and showed good linearity in the range 0-1000 mu g L-1. The method limits of detection ranged from 0.1 ng L-1 for compounds including cocaine, benzoylecgonine, norbenzoylecgonine and 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD to 100 ng L-1 for caffeine. Method quantification limits ranged from 0.5 to 154.2 ng L-1. Intra-and inter-day repeatabilities were on average less than 10%. The method accuracy range was within -33.1 to 30.1%. The new multi-residue method was used to analyse drugs of abuse in wastewater and river water in the UK environment. Of the targeted 65 compounds, 46 analytes were detected at levels above the method quantification limit (MQL) in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent, 43 in WWTP effluent and 36 compounds in river water.","bibo:AuthorList":["Baker, D R","Kasprzyk-Hordern, Barbara"],"dc:date":"2011-03-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Methods: Data were collected from smoking cessation service users from three contrasting areas of Great Britain-Glasgow, North Cumbria and Nottingham. Routine monitoring data were supplemented with CO-validated smoking status at 52-week follow-up and survey data on socio-economic circumstances and smoking-related behaviour. Analysis was restricted to the 2397 clients aged between 25 and 59. Results: At 52-week follow-up, 14.3% of the most affluent smokers remained quit compared with only 5.3% of the most disadvantaged. After adjustment for demographic factors, the most advantaged clients at the English sites and the Glasgow one-to-one programme were significantly more likely to have remained abstinent than those who were most disadvantaged [odds ratio: 2.5, confidence interval (CI): 1.44.7 and 7.5 CI: 1.4-40.3, respectively). Mechanisms producing the inequalities appeared to include treatment compliance, household smokers and referral source. Conclusions: Rather than quitting smoking, disadvantaged smokers quit treatment.

This paper is an early report on progress in developing a suite of six instructional e-learning modules on aspects of critical reading and writing at a research-intensive, science- and engineering-strong university. At this university, non-remedial academic writing development is supported by subject teaching staff, Royal Literary Fund Fellows, the English Language Centre and through information skills courses run by the Library. The current project seeks to complement the existing provision by providing undergraduates with guidance through e-learning modules that engage the students in learning tasks that can be completed independently or under the guidance of teaching staff in subject disciplines (shifting between \r\nmore instructional to more cognitive-constructivist and social-constructivist approaches; Mayes and de Freitas, 2004). Strengths of the e-learning project include collaboration between staff from widely different \r\nbackgrounds, including a professional writer and academic writing facilitator, a faculty librarian, and a teaching fellow. In addition, detailed feedback on each module’s learning efficacy and ease-of-use is being gathered systematically from students both during the module’s development and after its launch. In designing the e-modules, the researchers and developers have been driven by pedagogical imperatives (Mayes and de Freitas, 2004; Beetham and Sharpe, 2007; Biggs and Tang, 2007; Race, 2007) rather than wishing to be led or overly constrained by perceived limitations of online technologies. Among the \r\nchallenges have been how to design online activities that facilitate deep learning (Marton and Säljö, 1976; Biggs, 1987) and how to create experiences that are relevant to students from a variety of disciplines. The paper will consider the extent to which such aspirations have been met.","bibo:AuthorList":["Day, Trevor","Humphreys, Linda","Duncombe, Bridgette"],"dc:date":"2010-06-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

NLP has garnered little academic support until recently. Now there is growing recognition that NLP might have a role to play in teaching and learning in formal education (Craft, 2001; Ben-Avie et al., 2003; Tosey and Mathison, 2003a, 2003b; Day, 2005) and recent discoveries in neuroscience offer support for a neurological basis for the NLP constructs of rapport, sensory acuity and behavioural modelling (Gallese et al., 2004; Iacoboni et al., 2005; Fogassi et al., 2005; Rizzolatti et al., 2006). \r\n \r\nDrawing upon learning theory and pedagogical practice (Day, 2008), this paper considers three ways in which NLP might contribute to the teaching and learning of academic writing. The first is the use of perceptual positioning – metaphorically stepping into the shoes of others, including the reader of your writing (Hickman and Jacobson, 1997). The second is the crafting of language to encourage multi-modal representations in the reader’s inner landscape. Both these approaches relate to addressivity and, in particular, the ‘responsive understanding’ of the reader (Bakhtin, 1986; Cheyne and Tarulli, 1999). The third approach is the use of behavioural modelling (Dilts, 1998) to reveal key elements that contribute to the effective practice of writers, including their choice of how, where and when to write.","bibo:AuthorList":["Day, Trevor"],"dc:date":"2008-06-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

During casting, GFRP dowels are inserted into the holes to further connect the grating and box sections. Following preliminary component tests on two concrete blocks, experimental results show that the concrete filled grating provides a 100% increase in strain capacity when compared to a plain concrete block. It is therefore feasible to provide ductility to the complete system through the concrete in compression. Four push-out GFRP grating-box section specimens were then tested in double shear to assess the shear behaviour of the proposed GFRP dowel shear connector in both partially concrete-filled and fully concrete-filled box sections. From the resulting load-slip curves, a progressive longitudinal shear failure was seen to be provided by such a connection. The experimental results indicate that this type of shear connection can provide robustness and reasonable ductility to the system. Research is now underway to test a complete prototype system under variable load conditions to examine whether the behaviour is as predicted","bibo:AuthorList":["Gai, Xian","Ibell, Timothy","Darby, Antony","Evernden, Mark","Orr, John"],"dc:date":"2011-04-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It draws on social science literature on consumption and incorporates the key factors highlighted by the research on wellbeing determinants. Generally, it is accepted that consumption increases wellbeing by lifting people out of poverty and that it has a negative impact if it fails to place them at a higher social position. Other aspects defining consumption such as the symbolic meaning of goods, its pleasurable dimension, the role of goods and services as basic needs satisfiers, etc. have not been systematically approached from the perspective of their effect on wellbeing. The thesis takes on this challenge by incorporating the most salient features of consumption studied by social scientists through the concepts of motives and satisfiers. It draws on psychologists’ claim that motives are important in understanding the linkages between wellbeing and people’s behaviour. It also integrates the work of human needs theorists stressing the importance of analysing the effectiveness of goods and services as basic needs satisfiers.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe research follows a multi-methods approach that takes into account the local specificities of consumption, whilst aiming for a global understanding of the key factors mediating its relationship with human wellbeing; accounting for its objective and subjective dimensions. It uses regression analysis to study how consumption affects happiness through total expenditure and motives, and qualitative methods to explore the efficiency of satisfiers in meeting basic needs. The research finds, as expected, that in the Peruvian communities consumption enhances happiness when it improves basic needs levels and places people at a higher social position. People consuming because of hedonic reasons are also happier, but those consuming for social acceptance and higher status are not. Moreover, being motivated by basic needs is negatively associated with happiness. One of the reasons might be the type of satisfiers used. The exploratory study of needs satisfiers in a Peruvian slum points at their potential inefficiency, which might be contributing to people’s frustration through consumption.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Guillen Royo, Monica"],"dc:date":"2007-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24651,"sim:weight":0.214534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108980,"sim:weight":0.166406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388776,"sim:weight":0.162226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108538,"sim:weight":0.140806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Regression results indicate that the relational dimension of social capital fully or partially mediates the effect of the cognitive dimension on performance, and partially mediates the link between the structural dimension, operationalized as social interaction ties, and innovation performance. Further, high levels of legal bonds were found to moderate the relationship between the relational dimension of social capital and performance outcomes.

Previous identification of a closely related family of eight annotated metalloprotease genes of the M17 Merops family in the Drosophila sperm proteome (termed, Sperm-LeucylAminoPeptidases, S-LAPs 1-8) led us to hypothesize that this gene family may have experienced such a diversification during insect evolution.\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\u003cp\u003eResults: To assess putative functional activities of S-LAPs, we (i) demonstrated that all S-LAPs are specifically expressed in the testis, (ii) confirmed their presence in sperm by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, (iii) determined that they represent a major portion of the total protein in sperm and (iv) identified aminopeptidase enzymatic activity in sperm extracts using LAP-specific substrates. Functionally significant divergence at the canonical M17 active site indicates that the largest phylogenetic group of S-LAPs lost catalytic activity and likely acquired novel, as yet undetermined, functions in sperm prior to the expansion of the gene family.\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\u003cp\u003eConclusions: Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses revealed the dramatic expansion of the S-LAP gene family during Drosophila evolution and copy number heterogeneity in the genomes of related insects.

Our motivation comes from fluid flow in random porous media, where relevant functionals include the fluid pressure/velocity at any point in space or the breakthrough time of a pollution plume being transported by the velocity field. Our emphasis is on situations where a very large number of random variables is needed to model the coefficient field. As an alternative to classical Monte Carlo, we here employ quasi-Monte Carlo methods, which use deterministically chosen sample points in an appropriate (usually high-dimensional) parameter space. Each realization of the PDE solution requires a finite element (FE) approximation in space, and this is done using a realization of the coefficient field restricted to a suitable regular spatial grid (not necessarily the same as the FE grid). In the statistically homogeneous case the corresponding covariance matrix can be diagonalized and the required coefficient realizations can be computed efficiently using FFT. In this way we avoid the use of a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion, but introduce high nominal dimension in parameter space. Numerical experiments with 2-dimensional rough random fields, high variance and small length scale are reported, showing that the quasi-Monte Carlo method consistently outperforms the Monte Carlo method, with a smaller error and a noticeably better than O(N-1/2) convergence rate, where N is the number of samples. Moreover, the rate of convergence of the quasi-Monte Carlo method does not appear to degrade as the nominal dimension increases. Examples with dimension as high as 106 are reported.","bibo:AuthorList":["Graham, Ivan G.","Kuo,  F. Y.","Nuyens,  D.","Scheichl,  R.","Sloan,  I.

The data revealed that patient concerns and beliefs predicted general medication nonadherence. In addition, concerns were related to the direction of nonadherence: overuse of medication was related to increased perceived need for medication and greater concern over side effects; underuse was related to decreased concerns over withdrawal and increased mistrust in the prescribing doctor. Analyses also indicated that patient attitudes and concerns about medication were more predictive of nonadherence than both level of pain and the reported frequency of experienced side effects.

The rise of the institutional repository paradigm backs this up with its focus on co-operation within national or subject-based networks and the wider positioning of repositories within modular service frameworks like those devised by the Digital Library Federation\u0027s Service Framework Group (Lavoie, Henry \u0026 Dempsey, 2006). Long-term preservation is one of the areas where it is widely perceived that institutional repositories will need to co-operate. So, for example, it is assumed that not all institutions with repositories will be able to provide appropriate levels of preservation and curation infrastructure, technical support or expertise. Instead, it is expected that repositories will co-operate on preservation, e.g. within national or regional consortia or with preservation services provided by third parties. These preservation services might include both services that undertake to preserve content on behalf of repositories as well as shared services like registries of representation information that can be used to support specific preservation functions.

The purpose of the research was to gain an understanding of the hypothesis that TRIZ is a more effective innovation tool than traditionally applied innovation methodologies within the automotive industry. The objective was to derive, plan and deliver a TRIZ training programme, and to understand the effect of this intervention on the business through the action research methodology. The nature and process of innovation at the company was expected to be defined and measured in support of this objective. A review of literature failed to reveal an acceptable definition of innovation as a process. This led the author to investigate the nature of innovation by using the IDEF0 modelling tool. This helped to develop deeper understanding of innovation, and a measurement system to evaluate the innovativeness of the patent history of the company. Implementation of TRIZ enabled the researcher to develop best practice in teaching and using TRIZ in an industrial setting. Feedback from 17 workshop participants was that TRIZ tools were on balance easier to learn and understand than the commonly used methodology FMEA, and useful in their daily work. This view is supported through the ability of several workshop participants to solve a seemingly intractable problem that had thwarted several attempts at solution using the companies incumbent tools and approaches to problem solving and creativity. Insights gained into the nature and definition of innovation within this Thesis were surprising, and merit further study. TRIZ, in combination with other creativity enhancing methods is recommended as a powerful tool to increase the innovation power of automotive companies, and potentially more widely.","bibo:AuthorList":["Frobisher, Paul"],"dc:date":"2010-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A review of literature suggests there is limited research about the process of collaborating in engineering design and how collaborating is influenced by context. Collaborating is distinguished as a relational concept (involving at least two parties) that is a social process occurring in both pairs and a group. Studies currently focus on group effectiveness, one or two processes (e.g. communication), and either a group (e.g. a collaboration) or pairwise\r\nrelations (e.g. inter-organisational relationships).

Cross-case comparisons draw attention to an increase in ambiguity and uncertainty in combining tasks, roles, expertise and participants in original design type or inter-organisational cases.

Many pricing methodologies have been developed since the late 80‟s. The earlier approaches were not based on economic principle while the latest are directed to being more based on economic principle as the shift is towards deregulated and privatized electric power industry as opposed to the earlier vertically regulated regime. As a result, many such methodologies based on economic principle have emerged and these reflect the investment cost incurred in circuits and transformers to support real and reactive power flow. However, to reflect investment cost incurred for maintaining network voltages in network charges has received very little attention in network charges. Therefore, this research work is aimed to create a charging approach to recover investment cost, by the network operator, for maintaining the network voltages.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis thesis presents a new long-run incremental cost (LRIC) pricing approach for distribution networks and demonstrates the course of action of evaluating and allocating the network asset cost in the context of maintaining network voltages.

Then, this approach is extended to consider n-1 contingency situation as per statutory requirement that the network should be able to withstand such contingencies in order to enhance reasonable security and reliability in its network. Lastly, this LRIC-voltage network charging methodology is again extended to reflect the charges for existing network VAr compensation assets. In addition, this LRIC-voltage network pricing approach is improved to reflect better the nodal charges as the respective nodal voltage degradation rates, given corresponding load growth rate, are determined based on the P-V curve concept. The advantages of all these incorporate the ability to reflect correct forward-looking charges, to recognize both real and reactive powers, to provide locational charges and to provide charges for both generation and demand customers.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, two fundamental studies were conducted to demonstrate the trend in which the LRIC-voltage network charges would follow given different networks and different load growth rates. What set apart the LRIC-voltage network charges are those two parameters.

They offer an excellent indication of humanity’s demands upon Nature and allow evaluation of ecological deficit by contrasting supply and demand. The ecological debt many nations find themselves in is unsustainable, globally inequitable and adds to the growing effects of climate change. These footprints need to be further investigated, looking at historic and future trends in order to better understand, not only the global overuse of natural capital, but also the imbalance between nation states of the world. The value and limitations of the footprint must be recognised; the footprint alone cannot represent the full anthropogenic impacts upon the Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis thesis focuses on developing the definitions of the ecological and carbon footprints, analysing the significant factors that affect their composition. The selected parameters are diverse, ranging from a host of economic, geographic and climatic factors. It is shown that both the carbon and ecological footprints are primarily driven by economic welfare, a result that reflects the consumptive nature and fundamental basis of the footprint. Analysis of the resultant correlating equations, for both the environmental and carbon footprints, highlights the differences between the developing and industrialised world in terms of their profligate or frugal use of Nature’s resources. This concludes the stark contrast between these regions of the globe in terms of their per capita and total footprint values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe disparity between the populous South and the prosperous North is further investigated to the year 2100, with the use of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s scenarios and adaptation of the correlating ecological footprint equation.

For all scenarios the Southern regions rapidly increase their levels of total ecological footprint; in contrast the industrialised world maintains a relatively conservative evolution. Although different scenarios suggest contrasting future pathways, the hope of contraction and convergence among global footprint levels is not completely lost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe intensification of carbon emissions from both the affluent North and the majority South are considered with respect to population, economic and energy use trends from 1900 to the end of the twenty-first century.

This bacterium uses its fibronectin binding proteins (FnBPs) to invade host cells and it has been hypothesised that this provides a protected niche from host antimicrobial defences, allows access to deeper tissues and provides a reservoir for persistent or recurring infections. FnBPs contain multiple tandem fibronectin-binding repeats (FnBRs) which bind fibronectin with varying affinity but it is unclear what selects for this configuration. Since both colonisation and skin infection are dependent upon the interaction of S. aureus with keratinocytes we hypothesised that this might select for FnBP function and thus composition of the FnBR region. Initial experiments revealed that S. aureus attachment to keratinocytes is rapid but does not require FnBRs. By contrast, invasion of keratinocytes was dependent upon the FnBR region and occurred via similar cellular processes to those described for endothelial cells. Despite this, keratinocyte invasion was relatively inefficient and appeared to include a lag phase, most likely due to very weak expression of alpha(5)beta(1) integrins. Molecular dissection of the role of the FnBR region revealed that efficient invasion of keratinocytes was dependent on the presence of at least three high-affinity (but not low-affinity) FnBRs. Over-expression of a single high-affinity or three low-affinity repeats promoted invasion but not to the same levels as S. aureus expressing an FnBPA variant containing three high-affinity repeats. In summary, invasion of keratinocytes by S. aureus requires multiple high-affinity FnBRs within FnBPA, and given the importance of the interaction between these cell types and S. aureus for both colonisation and infection, may have provided the selective pressure for the multiple binding repeats within FnBPA.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edwards, Andrew M.","Potter,  U.","Meenan,  N.

The frequency and temperature dependences of the peak yield the Zeeman energy of electrons in the GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. We interpret the absorption peak as the result of competition between two spin-flip transitions: one activated by snake orbits oscillating at the boundary between positive and negative magnetic field domains, the other by microwaves. When both transitions are simultaneously resonant, the system forms a dark state which blocks spin flips and freezes snake orbit channelling.

By utilising an LVM instrument such as a laser tracker or indoor GPS (iGPS) in mobile robot navigation, many of the most difficult problems in mobile robot navigation can be simplified or avoided. Using the real-time position information from the laser tracker, a very simple navigation algorithm, and a low cost robot, 5 mm repeatability was achieved over a volume of 30 m radius. A surface digitisation scan of a wind turbine blade section was also demonstrated, illustrating possible applications of the method for manufacturing processes. Further, iGPS guidance of a small KUKA omni-directional robot has been demonstrated, and a full scale prototype system is being developed in cooperation with KUKA Robotics, UK.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Zheng","Liang,  M.","Maropoulos, Paul G."],"dc:date":"2011-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This property of pluripotency makes ESCs attractive as a model system for studying early development and for the generation of specific cell types for use in regenerative medicine and drug screening. In order to harness their potential, the molecular mechanisms regulating ESC pluripotency, proliferation and differentiation (i.e. cell fate) need to be understood so that pluripotency can be maintained during expansion, while differentiation to specific lineages can be induced accurately when required. The present review focuses on the potential roles that PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3)-dependent signalling play in the co-ordination and integration of mouse ESC pluripotency and proliferation and contrast this with our understanding of their functions in human ESCs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Welham, Melanie J.","Kingham, Emmajayne","Sanchez Ripoll, Yolanda","Kumpfmueller, Benjamin","Storm, Michael","Bone, Heather"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5845730,"sim:weight":0.313601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.296561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":677099,"sim:weight":0.257165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12325,"sim:weight":0.219977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844458,"sim:weight":0.205198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.177998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":705355,"sim:weight":0.172952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Stiffness profile is defined as the variation in local bending stiffness along the chord of a fin, from leading to trailing edge.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAn unmanned robotic submarine was created, using simple pitching flexible fins for propulsion. Its design and performance prompted a review of literature covering many aspects of oscillating fin propulsion, paying special attention to the studies of pitching flexible fins, of the type used in the submarine. In the body of previous work, fin stiffness profile was a consequence of the external shape profile of a fin; fins had not thus far been designed with stiffness profile specifically in mind. A hypothesis was proposed: “Use of a biomimetic fin stiffness profile can improve the effectiveness of a flexible oscillating fin, over that of a standard NACA designated fin shape.”\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eRectangular planform flexible fins of standard NACA 0012 design and 1:1 aspect ratio were tested alongside similar fins with a stiffness profile mimicking that of a pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus). The fins were oscillated with a pitching-only sinusoidal motion over a range of frequencies and amplitudes, while torque, lateral force and static thrust were measured. Over the range of oscillation parameters tested, it was shown that the fin with a biomimetic stiffness profile offered a significant improvement in static thrust over a fin of similar dimensions with a standard NACA 0012 aerofoil shape, and produced thrust more consistently over each oscillation cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA comparison of different moulding materials showed that the improvement was due to the stiffness profile itself, and was not simply an effect of altering the overall stiffness of the fin, or changing its natural frequency.

The latter project involved considerable development work on the production of a spin-polarised mono-energetic positron beam. The construction of the system is described through various trial steps with emphasis on the methods of maximum practical polarization of the positron beam and of electrons in the sample with the smallest possible loss of beam intensity. A new sodium-22 source capsule was purchased, having beryllium foil backing to minimise the depolarisation effects of backscattering, and the source-moderator spacing was increased. Different types of sample were tested, varying in atomic structure, purity, magnetic susceptibility, electronic structure, and electric conductivity - including iron of different purity and structure, mu metal and solid oxygen. After these tests measurements were taken on single crystal iron, and the results suggest that the positron response to magnetic structures is very small, and that prospects for depth profiling of dilute magnetic systems are not favourable at this time. A large number of other investigations have been performed on non-magnetic defect structures in various materials. Variable Energy Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy – here involving beam-based Doppler broadening – was applied to novel materials of relevance to photonic or electronic structures on the nanoscale. These included thin films of technological interest such as AlGaN and Ar plasma-treated TiO2: silicon and silicon-on-insulator samples implanted with He and Si ions to engineer vacancies: Si-rich SiO2 and SiN to form nanocrystals for photonic applications in which new findings on the evolution of the nanocrystals, and the role of the nanocrystal-oxide interface in optical emission, could be very useful in the technological development of such systems: and a study of the structural phase and nano-pore properties of water ice films grown from vapour on a cold copper surface. The variety of these experimental studies serves to underline the wide applicability of positron beam spectroscopy in research on defect and nanostructure structures.

A novel engine air charging system including a charge air handling unit (CAHU) has been developed which is connected to an engine to emulate advanced boosting system conditions. Significant analytical and development work has focused on generating a real-time turbocharger model such that the CAHU can be effectively controlled to emulate the turbocharger performance under both steady and pulsating conditions. Experimental work was carried out to evaluate this new engine air charge testing system against a production turbocharged baseline engine. The accuracies with respect to the boost pressure, turbocharger speed, mass air flow, and fuel consumption in the steady state tests are above 95%, and the level of confidence for the engine back pressure is approximately 90%. The difference of turbocharger speed between the steady turbocharger model and the pulsation model is also identified. In engine transient tests, the boost pressure and engine torque have shown fast response characteristics similar to that of the baseline engine. While general transient trends were achieved, some issues were identified with the high speed control of the CAHU interacting with the dSPACE real time turbocharger model. It is proposed that future improvement can be achieved via applying new control algorithms to improve the accuracy and tracking the CAHU control without increasing the system instabilities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhang, Kai"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Experiments were performed on DOCs, which were specially prepared by Johnson Matthey, and had thermocouples mounted in their walls to measure axial temperature profiles. These DOCs consisted of a Pt catalyst dispersed in an alumina washcoat on a cordierite monolith supports, and were representative of a commercial application. Experiments were performed on Full-scale DOCs (o.d. \u003d 106 mm, length \u003d 114 mm), and also on Thin-slice DOCs (length \u003d 5 and 10 mm), which generate some interesting data, and enabled a technique that is normally only used in laboratory bench-top experiments to be applied to a live engine. A number of different methodologies were developed based on (a) the operation of the engine at pseudo-steady-state operating conditions, and (b) transient experiments (e.g. a pulse of CO was injected into the exhaust gas just before the DOC). For example, it was shown how experiments on a live engine can be used to explore: (a) the hysteresis between light-off and extinction curves, (b) how catalyst temperature rise during warm-up of a DOC, (c) the promotion effect that hydrogen has on the conversion of CO, (d) the extent of competition for active catalytic sites, e.g. between CO, THCs, propane or hydrogen. The main findings are: (a) the hysteresis between light-off and extinction curves are mainly caused by CO inhibition, (b) the promotion effect of hydrogen on CO oxidation is largely attributed to thermal effect, (c) LHHW form rate expression is not adequate for catalytic converter modelling under transient conditions, (d) the competition for active catalytic sites is not apparent at the test conditions performed in this thesis. Moreover, a number of case studies were also used to illustrate how the experimental results/techniques developed in this thesis, may be used to support modelling studies.\r\niii","bibo:AuthorList":["Ye, Shifei"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8821124,"sim:weight":0.273679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54196,"sim:weight":0.174613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26540,"sim:weight":0.134031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Do mechanisms of noise control impact genome organization? In yeast, the expression of one gene can affect that of a very close neighbor. As the effect is highly regionalized, we hypothesize that genes in different orientations will have differing degrees of coupled expression and, in turn, different noise levels. Divergently organized gene pairs, in particular those with bidirectional promoters, have close promoters, maximizing the likelihood that expression of one gene affects the neighbor. With more distant promoters, the same is less likely to hold for gene pairs in nondivergent orientation. Stochastic models suggest that coupled chromatin dynamics will typically result in low abundance-corrected noise (ACN). Transcription of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) from a bidirectional promoter, we thus hypothesize to be a noise-reduction, expression-priming, mechanism. The hypothesis correctly predicts that protein-coding genes with a bidirectional promoter, including those with a ncRNA partner, have lower ACN than other genes and divergent gene pairs uniquely have correlated ACN. Moreover, as predicted, ACN increases with the distance between promoters. The model also correctly predicts ncRNA transcripts to be often divergently transcribed from genes that a priori would be under selection for low noise (essential genes, protein complex genes) and that the latter genes should commonly reside in divergent orientation. Likewise, that genes with bidirectional promoters are rare subtelomerically, cluster together, and are enriched in essential gene clusters is expected and observed. We conclude that gene orientation and transcription of ncRNAs are candidate modulators of noise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Guang Z.","Lercher,  M.

Existing research supports such claims by pointing to the failings and misleading nature of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. However, few studies have focused in depth on what tobacco companies hoped to achieve through CSR or reflected on the extent to which these ambitions have been realised. Methods and Findings : Iterative searching relating to CSR strategies was undertaken of internal British American Tobacco (BAT) documents, released through litigation in the US. Relevant documents (764) were indexed and qualitatively analysed. In the past decade, BAT has actively developed a wide-ranging CSR programme. Company documents indicate that one of the key aims of this programme was to help the company secure access to policymakers and, thereby, increase the company\u0027s chances of influencing policy decisions. Taking the UK as a case study, this paper demonstrates the way in which CSR can be used to renew and maintain dialogue with policymakers, even in ostensibly unreceptive political contexts. In practice, the impact of this political use of CSR is likely to be context specific; depending on factors such as policy élites\u0027 understanding of the credibility of companies as a reliable source of information. Conclusions : The findings suggest that tobacco company CSR strategies can enable access to and dialogue with policymakers and provide opportunities for issue definition. CSR should therefore be seen as a form of corporate political activity. This underlines the need for broad implementation of Article 5.3 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Measures are needed to ensure transparency of interactions between all parts of government and the tobacco industry and for policy makers to be made more aware of what companies hope to achieve through CSR.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fooks, Gary J","Gilmore, Anna B","Collin, Jeff","Holden, Chris","Kelly, Lee"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Microclimate, noise and PM were monitored during field surveys with 260 questionnaire-guided interviews at a road construction site and a traffic site on the UC San Diego campus. The overall comfort was determined primarily by the thermal environment. The air quality was considered to be poor by 42% of the interviewees at the construction site, which was burdened with higher PM counts and sound levels. Overall, higher PM concentrations were correlated with perception of poor air quality. Similarity between the overall air quality and how dusty it feels suggests that visual clues of PM, such as dust, affect the perception of air quality and pollution. The effect of medical or smoking history on the perceived air quality was also examined. People with a medical history of hay fever voted more frequently for poor air quality conditions than those without, whereas current smokers were the least sensitive to ambient air quality conditions. Through the exposure-response relationships between the various perception votes and PM, it was possible to predict perceived air cleanness using the PM count. Understanding the human assessment of environmental stimuli could inform the design and development of urban spaces, in relation to the allocation of uses and activities, along with air quality management schemes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nikolopoulou, Maria-Heleni","Kleissl,  Jan","Linden,  P.

Neither of these conditions reflects a normal exposure of an individual when re-entering an area after pesticide application, that is, contact with dried residue of the diluted product on foliage. Methodology has therefore been developed to determine a relevant estimate of this potential dermal re-entry exposure from pesticide residues. Potential delivery platforms have been characterized for the transfer of pesticide residue to skin. Spin coating has been used to deposit uniform pesticide layers on to each platform. Five pesticides have been chosen to encompass a wide range of physicochemical properties: atrazine, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), chlorpyrifos, monocrotophos, and acetochlor. In vitro (Franz diffusion cell) experiments have been performed to monitor the transfer of these pesticides from the delivery platforms onto and through excised porcine skin. Parallel experiments were also conducted with aqueous pesticide dilutions for comparison, and a final in vivo measurement using ibuprofen (as a model compound) complemented the in vitro data. The results demonstrate that transfer of chemical residue onto and subsequently through the skin is dependent on the physical attributes of the residue formed. Thus, assessing dermal exposure to pesticides based on skin contact with either the chemical concentrate or a relevant aqueous dilution may incorrectly estimate the risk for re-entry scenarios.","bibo:AuthorList":["Belsey, Natalie A.","Cordery, Sarah F.","Bunge,  A.

In more recent times, detailed information on external and internal morphology for bee classification has been obtained using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. MicroCT is emerging as a new method for non-invasive 3D computerised X-ray tomographic imaging of insects at the microscopic level, and in this study has been evaluated for its use in morphological studies of bees. A Skyscan 1172 MicroCT system was used to assess the internal and external morphology of the Australian stingless bee Trigona carbonaria with particular focus on the proventricular plates. MicroCT was useful in non-invasively visualising gross external morphological features such as the articulations of the coxae, trochanters, tibiae and tarsi of each leg including broadened hind basitarsi. Image magnification revealed further detail such as antennal scapes and the various parts of the tongue including the proboscis and labia. However, the individual facets of the eye were barely discernable and MicroCT did not reveal fine details of hairs on the body or legs. Internal morphology was clearly visualised, including the tracheal system and details of the proventriculus and proventricular basal plates which form the leaflets of the proventricular valve. Thus, the characteristic features of the proventricular basal plates of Meliponini could be quickly and easily identified non-invasively. Therefore, MicroCT, as one of the emerging techniques of diagnostic radioentomology, has particular advantages for non-invasively and non-destructively imaging bees and, particularly, rare or more scientifically valued insects such as museum specimens and those trapped in amber.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greco, Mark","Jones, Allan","Spooner-Hart, R","Holford, P"],"dc:date":"2008-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2809997,"sim:weight":0.342578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26055,"sim:weight":0.14002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108928,"sim:weight":0.111029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Nevertheless, some parasitic species are able to bypass colony defences. In particular, some beetle nest invaders cannot be killed or removed by workers of social bees, thus creating the need for alternative social defence strategies to ensure colony survival. Here we show, using diagnostic radioentomology, that stingless bee workers (Trigona carbonaria) immediately mummify invading adult small hive beetles (Aethina tumida) alive by coating them with a mixture of resin, wax and mud, thereby preventing severe damage to the colony. In sharp contrast to the responses of honeybee and bumblebee colonies, the rapid live mummification strategy of T. carbonaria effectively prevents beetle advancements and removes their ability to reproduce. The convergent evolution of mummification in stingless bees and encapsulation in honeybees is another striking example of co-evolution between insect societies and their parasites.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greco, Mark","Hoffmann, Dorothee","Dollin, Anne","Duncan, Michael","Spooner-Hart, Robert","Neumann, Peter"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As GLUT4 vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is a highly regulated step in GLUT4 traffic, we investigated whether AS160 and 14-3-3 interactions are involved in this process. Fusion was inhibited by a human truncated AS160 variant that encompasses the first N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, by either of the two N-terminal PTB domains, and by a tandem construct of both PTB domains of rat AS160. We also found that in vitro GLUT4 vesicle fusion was strongly inhibited by the 14-3-3-quenching inhibitors R18 and fusicoccin. To investigate the mode of interaction of AS160 and 14-3-3, we examined insulin-dependent increases in the levels of these proteins on GLUT4 vesicles. 14-3-3 gamma was enriched on insulin-stimulated vesicles, and its binding to AS160 on GLUT4 vesicles was inhibited by the AS160 tandem PTB domain construct.

Strikingly, the increased orientational disorder at elevated temperatures barely affects the ability of excitons to be transported over large distances, though disorder influences the directionality of the energy diffusion process. Detailed quantum-chemical calculations show that this result arises from a trade-off between reduced excitonic couplings and increased spectral overlap at high temperatures.

Methods: A total of 52 male elite-level 100-m races were recorded from publicly available television broadcasts, with 11 analyzed athletes performing in 10 or more races. For each run of each athlete, the average SF and SL over the whole 100-m distance was analyzed. To determine any SF or SL reliance for an individual athlete, the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between the SF-time versus SL-time relationships was derived using a criterion nonparametric boot-strapping technique. Results: Athletes performed these races with various combinations of SF and SL reliance. Athlete A10 yielded the highest positive CI difference (SL reliance), with a value of 1.05 (CI \u003d 0.50-1.53). The largest negative difference (SF reliance) occurred for athlete A11 as -0.60, with the CI range of -1.20 to 0.03. Conclusions: Previous studies have generally identified only one of these variables to be the main reason for faster running velocities. However, this study showed that there is a large variation of performance patterns among the elite athletes and, overall, SF or SL reliance is a highly individual occurrence. It is proposed that athletes should take this reliance into account in their training, with SF-reliant athletes needing to keep their neural system ready for fast leg turnover and SL-reliant athletes requiring more concentration on maintaining strength levels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Salo, Aki I T","Bezodis, I N","Batterham, A M","Kerwin, D G"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":13965,"sim:weight":0.279524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.143021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.137012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1915095,"sim:weight":0.122648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.121769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108251,"sim:weight":0.114062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although it is well understood that the mixing is a key process in DPI carrier based formulation, there remains a limited understanding of how blending processes affect in-process material properties and the resulting distribution of the drug in the final dosage form. A great number of variables are considered relevant to the interfacial forces in adhesive mixtures, but their effects have mostly been investigated individually, without taking account of the influence they may have on each other. Interactions may be expected and without proper choices made and definitions given for all the variables involved, conclusions from studies on adhesive mixtures are of less relevance. By varying any of the variables that are not subject of the study, an opposite effect may be obtained. Currently, there is a strong focus on exploring techniques for the characterisation of drug and carrier surface properties that are believed to have an influence on the interparticulate forces in adhesive mixtures. For a number of surface properties it may be questioned whether they are really the key parameters to investigate however. Their orders of magnitude are subordinate to the effects they are supposed to have on the drug-to-carrier forces. Therefore, they seem rather indicators of other variability and their influence may be dominated by other effects. Finally, the relevance of inhaler design is often ignored. By using powerful inhalers, the effect of many variables of current concern may become less relevant. Carrier properties that are considered disadvantageous at present may even become desirable when a more appropriate type of dispersion force is applied. This can be shown for the effect of carrier surface rugosity when inertial separation forces are applied instead of the more widely applied lift and drag forces. Therefore, inhaler design should be taken into consideration when evaluating studies on adhesive mixtures. It should also become an integral part of powder formulation for inhalation.","bibo:AuthorList":["de Boer,  A. H.","Chan,  H.

Here we show that methane can be converted into ethane during many hours over two platinum supported catalysts at 370 C. Analysis of the experimental data and DFT calculations, available in the literature, suggests that this reaction proceeds via formation and subsequent coupling of surface carbonaceous species (CH x and C) and that the relatively stable catalyst performance is associated with slow coupling of carbon species. Our work indicates that other transition metal (Co, Fe, Ru, Rh) supported catalysts should be active in methane conversion into ethane at similar and, possibly, lower temperatures. Thus, further research into these catalytic systems would furnish new experimental data on formation and transformation of surface CH x species, which are believed to be involved in such reactions as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, methanation and methane steam reforming.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lukyanov, Dmitry B","Vazhnova, Tatiana"],"dc:date":"2011-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

WMG are based on the notion that local communication is more energy-efficient than the standard 3G communication.

This paper proposes the use of a normative framework modelling technique and multi-agent simulations to support the early and rapid development of prototype systems to analyse solutions for solving the collaboration dilemma in WMG. Both tools allow for the capture of essential features of interactions between components in open architectures, therefore assisting in concept refinement, identification of actors, policy exploration and the feasibility assessment of new systems. With the help of these models we show how it is possible to quantify energy consumption, explore management policies and evaluate individual utility functions, all of which act as drivers in helping realise the WMG concept.","bibo:AuthorList":["Balke,  Tina","De Vos, Marina","Padget, Julian"],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.233104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931029,"sim:weight":0.224811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, social desirability bias (SDB) has been found to distort data validity where respondents tend to over-report what is socially desirable and vice versa. We argue that this phenomenon has not been fully understood in the nonprofit context as existing social desirability scales are not appropriate to be used in giving surveys. Thus, this paper is the first to extend understanding of SDB to the nonprofit context and to explore its motivating factors. Based on a multidisciplinary literature review and qualitative interviews with various senior practitioners from the fundraising and marketing research sectors, it is suggested that SDB is a multidimensional construct yielding five dimensions, namely, impression management, self-deception, level of involvement, perceived benefits and social norms. The paper then discusses the implications for nonprofit researchers and concludes with directions for future research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee,  Z.","Woodliffe,  L."],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":56605,"sim:weight":0.181218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388776,"sim:weight":0.173435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53666,"sim:weight":0.147601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340559,"sim:weight":0.136931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50121,"sim:weight":0.132733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In 40 reciprocal best friend dyads friendship quality perceptions were examined as a consequence of attachment characteristics of both the self and one’s best friend. Results :Results provided evidence that the nature of the adolescent-parent attachment relationship was significantly related to sporting friendship experiences.

Electrical impulses applied to dendrites diffuse along microwires to the soma. The soma is the active part of the neuron, which regenerates input pulses above a voltage threshold and transmits them into the axon. Our concept of neuron is a major step forward because its spatial structure controls the timing of pulses, which arrive at the soma. Dendrites and axon act as transmission delay lines, which modify the information, coded in the timing of pulses. We have finally shown that noise enhances the detection sensitivity of the neuron by helping the transmission of weak periodic signals. A maximum enhancement of signal transmission was observed at an optimum noise level known as stochastic resonance. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with simulations of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Our neuron is therefore extremely well suited to providing feedback on the various mathematical approximations of neurons and building functional networks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Samardak, A S","Nogaret, Alain","Janson, N B","Balanov, A","Farrer, I","Ritchie, D A"],"dc:date":"2011-05-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A variety of methods are available for the measurement of fuel consumption based on the volumetric or gravimetric principle or by equating carbon in the fuel to carbon in the exhaust flow. Measurements of fuel consumption from five different experimental campaigns with varying engine set-ups are presented, highlighting discrepancies between gravimetric fuel balance and exhaust feed gas carbon balance. Differences were larger for cold-start tests and if all correction factors are neglected offsets can reach 7 per cent. The carbon balance and gravimetric methods have been considered independently to identify sources of inaccuracy and improvements have been suggested in the form of correction factors. The carbon balance estimate is dependent on a number of separate measurements, all taken at different conditions. To account for these, two correction factors were compared, the first proposed by the British Standards Institution and the second derived from the experimental conditions of each of the measurements. The gravimetric measurement was affected by changes in fuel temperature within the fuelling circuit and a corrective method was proposed based on the change in fuel density. When correction factors were applied to each of the measurement techniques for the five experimental campaigns, discrepancies were less than 1 per cent, which, in most cases, was small enough for there to be no statistically significant difference between measurements. In addition, in some cases the scatter of results was reduced, contributing to improved test-to-test repeatability. The improved performance when using correction factors was explained by including known disturbances, such as fuel temperature and ambient humidity, as inputs to the measurement system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burke, Richard D","Brace, Christian J","Hawley, J Gary"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":33709,"sim:weight":0.251238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931561,"sim:weight":0.197343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57340,"sim:weight":0.19579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28485,"sim:weight":0.191813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.174525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.169334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651854,"sim:weight":0.167441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At present, requirements for temporal and spatial parameters for localized delivery are unclear, with a variety of sustained delivery approaches being examined. Two polymer-based sustained formulations containing the 165 amino acid isoform of human recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor-A (rhVEGF(165)) were evaluated for their potential application in the treatment of PVD following intramuscular injection. Microspheres prepared from a 50:50 ratio of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and a gel of PLGA polymer solubilized in N-methyl pyrrolidone (PLGA:NMP) were each loaded with rhVEGF(165) and tested in vitro and in vivo. PLGA microspheres averaged similar to 30 mu m in diameter and contained 8.9% (w/w) rhVEGF(165), while the PLGA:NMP gel was formulated with varying amounts of spray freeze-dried rhVEGF(165) to result in final gel formulations having concentrations of 0.36, 0.72, or 3.6 mg/mL rhVEGF(165). In vitro release of rhVEGF(165) from PLGA microspheres showed similar to 10% cumulative release by day 6, whereas the cumulative release of rhVEGF(165) from the PLGA:NMP gel matrices (0.65% w/w loading) was less than 0.25% at this same time point. While the in vitro release characteristics of these two sustained release formulations were broadly different, the plasma rhVEGF(165) concentration-time profiles following hind-limb intramuscular (IM) injection of these formulations in non-compromised rats revealed similar in vivo pharmacokinetics. Three-dimensional resin casts of vascular architecture were prepared at days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, and 75 following a single IM dosing of these sustained release microsphere and gel matrix formulations in the gastrocnemius muscle of immune-compromised mice. Scanning electron microscopic visualization of these vascular casts demonstrated spatial arrangement of capillary sprouts and vessel enlargement consistent with profound vascular changes occurring within 3 days of dosing that persisted for 2 months, approximately 1 month beyond the anticipated completion of rhVEGF(165) release from these sustained delivery formulations. Vascular re-modeling events were correlated with histological and immunohistochemical parameters attributed to known biological actions of rhVEGF(165) signaling. Together, these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results support the use of sustained release PLGA-based formulations for the local delivery of rhVEGF(165) to achieve a durable vascular re-modeling response.","bibo:AuthorList":["Daugherty,  A.

This technique uniquely provides label-free, nondestructive, three-dimensional images with high spatiotemporal resolution. It reveals novel features of (trans)dermal drug delivery in the tissue environment: different rates of drug penetration via hair follicles as compared to the intercellular pathway across the stratum corneum are directly observed, and the precipitation of drug crystals on the skin surface is visualized after the percutaneous penetration of the cosolvent excipient in the formulation.

The problem of limited observations due to the small number of LEOs in operation is overcome by constraining the plasmaspheric electron density to be constant along magnetic field lines. A coordinate transform from a spherical coordinate system to one defined in terms of Euler potentials is sufficient to provide unambiguous solutions. Preliminary results using data from the COSMIC satellite constellation are presented showing the response of the plasmasphere to changes in the interplanetary medium.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spencer, Paul S.

Sr ion migration is enhanced by interaction with an anion vacancy: In the bulk material, Sr cations migrate linearly between adjacent lattice sites, through the center of a square formed by four oxygen ions; however, the activation barrier is substantially reduced, and the path curved, in the presence of an oxygen vacancy. The contribution of partial Schottky disorder in the SrO sublattice to ion migration explains the wide spread of experimental results to date, with direct implications for diffusion processes at highly doped surfaces and interfaces of SrTiO3 as well as other perovskite materials.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walsh, Aron","Catlow, C R A","Smith, A G H","Sokol, A A","Woodley, S M"],"dc:date":"2011-06-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It occupies a unique place in the study of Euroscepticism due to its population’s stable and persistent misgivings about European integration. The thesis seeks to find out what Norwegian Euroscepticism really is and how it can be explained. Adopting a theoretical framework drawn from the Norwegian and comparative literature on EU support and a sequential exploratory mixed methods research design, the thesis first examines how the Norwegian Eurosceptic discourse has played out in a major national newspaper and the party political arena in the last fifty years, through the three periods of heightened Euroscepticism (1961-62; 1970-72; 1989-1994) and one period of latent Euroscepticism (1995-2010). Subsequently, the results of the qualitative analysis are tested on the 1994 Referendum Study to ascertain whether the issues mobilized in the public debate do indeed resonate on the popular level. The thesis finds that there are essentially two broad types of Norwegian Euroscepticism, mainstream (centre/left) and right-wing Euroscepticism. It argues that concerns about postmaterialist Values, political Culture and Rural society (VCR) are at the heart of mainstream Norwegian Euroscepticism, that values (the desire to make Norway and the world a better place), political culture (selfdetermination) and rural attachment are much more potent explanations for the phenomenon than economic interest (wanting to make Norway a richer place) or national identity concerns. Right-wing Euroscepticism, however, has an altogether different structure. Although it shares the political culture element with its mainstream counterpart, it does not exhibit postmaterialist or rural society sentiments. Conversely, it is driven by economic utilitarianism and the view that the EU is not sufficiently neo-liberalist. The findings also suggest that perceived cultural threat might be relevant to right-wing Euroscepticism, but this is an issue which must be investigated further by future research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skinner, Marianne S"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is argued that such a challenge is drawn from the need to account for conditions of violence and suffering without recourse to the traditional grounds of redemption. They set out to question the symbols that underpin a faith in its possibilities. Such films counter these grounds with a form of perpetuated suspense that continually withholds resolution, stressing and destabilising both the terms of redemption and the affect of its aesthetic representations.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSignificantly, this thesis examines films from the years following 1989 that confront this central theme within conditions of historical hiatus and the disintegration of ideological certainties occurring in the wake of European communism. These films, by Kira Muratova, Béla Tarr, Artur Aristakisyan, Alexander Sokurov, Bruno Dumont, Roy Andersson, Ulrich Seidl and Gus Van Sant, present a world in which human beings are always already turned against themselves, placing them in the context of contemporary philosophical aporias that identify the human condition as enigmatic and resisting of itself.

For example, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) is a synthetic biomaterial widely used in tissue engineering. However, the hydrophobicity of PLGA results in scaffolds that are poorly wettable, and which, therefore, possess poor mass transfer properties for the delivery of nutrients and the removal of waste. The present work aimed to develop more hydrophilic PLGA scaffolds, specifically hollow fibre membranes, within a bioreactor system, which enables co-culture of cells in order to direct stem cell differentiation. Large quantities of costly growth factors are required over long periods for stem cell differentiation. Therefore, this project also aimed to use a cell line as a “factory” for the inexpensive, in situ growth factor production. Hollow fibres were fabricated by wet spinning and a hydrophilic polymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), was added to the PLGA solution at three different concentrations (1.25, 2.5, 5% w/w) in order to obtain a more hydrophilic membrane. Results indicated that 5% PVA-PLGA hollow fibres were the only membranes which allowed permeation of water, BSA and cell-secreted hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), thus indicating that they are the most suitable membranes for use in bioreactor devices. However, these membranes failed to improve cell-attachment. Cell secreted HGF was shown to be more stable in a dynamic culture environment than commercial HGF, thus suggesting its suitability for applications in bioreactor devices. However, using both commercial and cell-secreted HGF, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation was unsuccessful. In conclusion, this work has developed a hollow fibre membrane which is more permeable to water and proteins for a higher mass transfer of nutrients, and has realised a model system for the inexpensive production of growth factors for use in bioreactor devices and the differentiation of stem cells.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meneghello, Giulia"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Through a case study of the Zambian mining sector, where state-firm relations have been highly contentious following privatisation in the late 1990s, I develop an interdisciplinary and empirically grounded account of how policy evolves. My findings are based on over 100 interviews conducted with employees of Chinese, Indian and ‘western’ case-study firms, as well as government officials, NGOs and other stakeholders. My aim is to give adequate attention to both state and firm perspectives on regulatory policy making. To this end, the thesis first reviews the literature on policy making in the African state as well as theories of institutional change. It then draws on evolutionary economics and organisational theory, to develop a framework for understanding firm behaviour that emphasises the role of organisational routines and objectives. I develop and define the concept of organisational learning as the process through which organisational routines and objectives change over time. I find that policy development in Zambia, in its formal expression, appears framed around a ‘partnership approach’ to regulation. This approach is based on a view of government as enabler of private investment, emphasising state-firm consultations and consensus in policy development. This approach contrasts but co-exists with an alternative expression of state power through the Presidency, which maintains strong informal links with the foreign mining companies. I find significant yet nuanced variation in organisational routines and aims across the companies under study. This includes the tendency among western companies to seek operational stability by engaging with local stakeholders directly, whilst Chinese investors prefer to operate through close relationships with the Presidency, relying on the Zambian state to ‘broker’ its wider social relations. Over time there is some evidence of organisational learning taking place among the mining companies, including through convergence in regulatory standards and practices. Yet differences persist because routines and aims – conditioned by a firm’s institutional background – change slowly over time, even in the presence of inefficiencies. Zambia’s mining sector was during the period under study subject to various pressures for policy reform, stemming from discontent with limited tax contributions and pervasive negative environmental and safety impacts. These reform proposals, however, failed to move ahead despite support from some of the mining companies. I show how Zambia’s accommodating and pro-investor regulatory framework sits uneasily with an interventionist political culture and a diverse mining sector. The consensus among the regulated companies – on which effective partnership regulation relies – proves elusive in a ‘presidential’ state that readily accommodates different articulations of state-firm relations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haglund, Dan"],"dc:date":"2010-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Evidence suggests that objective measures, rather than subjective tools such as questionnaires, are more likely to detect associations between physical activity and health in children. To date, a number of studies of children and adolescents across diverse cultures around the globe have collected accelerometer measures of physical activity accompanied by a broad range of predictor variables and associated health outcomes. The International Children\u0027s Accelerometry Database (ICAD) project pooled and reduced raw accelerometer data using standardized methods to create comparable outcome variables across studies. Such data pooling has the potential to improve our knowledge regarding the strength of relationships between physical activity and health. This manuscript describes the contributing studies, outlines the standardized methods used to process the accelerometer data and provides the initial questions which will be addressed using this novel data repository. Methods: Between September 2008 and May 2010 46,131 raw Actigraph data files and accompanying anthropometric, demographic and health data collected on children (aged 3-18 years) were obtained from 20 studies worldwide and data was reduced using standardized analytical methods. Results: When using greater than or equal to 8, 10 and 12 hrs of wear per day as a criterion, 96%, 93.5% and 86.2% of the males, respectively, and 96.3%, 93.7% and 86% of the females, respectively, had at least one valid day of data. Conclusions: Pooling raw accelerometer data and accompanying phenotypic data from a number of studies has the potential to: a) increase statistical power due to a large sample size, b) create a more heterogeneous and potentially more representative sample, c) standardize and optimize the analytical methods used in the generation of outcome variables, and d) provide a means to study the causes of inter-study variability in physical activity. Methodological challenges include inflated variability in accelerometry measurements and the wide variation in tools and methods used to collect non-accelerometer data.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sherar, L.

We consider a scalar elliptic equation in a two- or three-dimensional domain with a highly heterogeneous (multiscale) diffusion coefficient. This coefficient is allowed to have large jumps not only across but also along subdomain interfaces and in the interior of the subdomains. In other words, the subdomain partitioning does not need to resolve any jumps in the coefficient. Under suitable assumptions, we derive bounds for the condition numbers of one-level and all-floating FETI that are robust with respect to strong variations in the contrast in the coefficient, and that are explicit in some geometric parameters associated with the coefficient variation. In particular, robustness holds for face, edge, and vertex islands in high-contrast media. As a central tool we prove and use new weighted Poincar, and discrete Sobolev type inequalities that are explicit in the weight.

This general epistemological issue haunts biology where it has a specific focus in evolutionary arguments. It arises because of the incompatibility between definitive logical systems of \u0027contradiction or unity\u0027, which can only apply to inert material systems, and natural evolutionary processes of cumulative energetic transformation. This incompatibility makes any attempt to apply definitive logic to evolutionary change unrealistic and paradoxical. It is important to recognise, because discrete perceptions of self and group, based on the supposition that any distinguishable identity can be completely cut free, as an \u0027independent singleness\u0027, from the space it inescapably includes and is included in, are a profound but unnecessary source of psychological, social and environmental conflict. These perceptions underlie Darwin\u0027s definition of \u0027natural selection\u0027 as \u0027the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life\u0027. They result in precedence being given to striving for homogeneous supremacy, through the competitive suppression of others, instead of seeking sustainable, co-creative evolutionary relationship in spatially and temporally heterogeneous communities. Here, I show how \u0027natural inclusion\u0027, a new, post-dialectic understanding of evolutionary process, becomes possible through recognising space as a limitless, indivisible, receptive (non-resistive) \u0027intangible presence\u0027 vital for movement and communication, not as empty distance between one tangible thing and another. The fluid boundary logic of natural inclusion as the co-creative, fluid dynamic transformation of all through all in receptive spatial context, allows all form to be understood as flow-form, distinctive but dynamically continuous, not singularly discrete. This simple move from regarding space and boundaries as sources of discontinuity and discrete definition to sources of continuity and dynamic distinction correspondingly enables self-identity to be understood as a dynamic inclusion of neighbourhood, through the inclusion of space throughout and beyond all natural figural forms as configurations of energy. Fully to appreciate and communicate the significance of this move, it is necessary to widen the linguistic, mathematical and imaginative remit of conventional scientific argument and explication so as to include more poetic, fluid and artistic forms of expression.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rayner, Alan D"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108246,"sim:weight":0.28977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86312,"sim:weight":0.2796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109076,"sim:weight":0.255606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108655,"sim:weight":0.253779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.252061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.251682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108947,"sim:weight":0.248703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86055,"sim:weight":0.190929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We have used this reconstruction to investigate how the anatomy and morphometry of the nasal passageway influence the olfactory ability of the hagfish. We found that the long, broad section of the passageway preceding the nasal chamber will delay the response to an odor by 1-2 s. Diffusion of odorant to the olfactory epithelium, on which the olfactory sensitivity of an animal depends, will be favored by the relatively large surface area of the olfactory epithelium (similar to 140 mm(2)) and a modest expansion in the nasal chamber. Oscillating flow (0.3-0.4 Hz) within the narrow (65-130 mu m) sensory channels of the nasal chamber is laminar (Reynolds number similar to 5) and quasi-steady (Womersley number generally less than one). Distribution of flow over the olfactory epithelium may be aided by: (a) a narrowing before the nasal chamber; (b) partial blockage of the nasal passageway by a protrusion on the central olfactory lamella; and (c) the inward inclination of the olfactory lamellae.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holmes, W M","Cotton, R","Xuan, V B","Rygg, A D","Craven, B A","Abel, R L","Slack, R","Cox, Jonathan P L"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.111918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108347,"sim:weight":0.10981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The key is the combination of vision algorithms and physics laws. Shape from shading is used to capture the change of the water\u0027s surface, from which a vertical velocity gradient field is calculated. Such a gradient field is used to constrain the tracking of horizontal velocities by minimizing an energy function as a weighted combination of mass-conservation and intensity-conservation.

Difficile","bibo:abstract":"Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a serious problem within the healthcare environment where the bacterium causes symptoms ranging from mild diarrhoea to life-threatening colitis. In addition to its principal virulent factors, Toxin A and Toxin B, some C. difficile strains produce a binary toxin (CDT) composed of two subunits namely CDTa and CDTb that are produced and secreted from the cell as two separate polypeptides. Once in the gut, these fragments have the potential to combine to form a potent cytotoxin whose role in the pathogenesis of CDI is presently unclear. This thesis is a step towards understanding structural and functional aspects of the binary toxin produced by C. difficile. The first half of this thesis (chapter I and II) provides a brief introduction to the method of structure determination of proteins molecules, i. e. X-ray crystallography and a detailed overview of C. difficile and the three known toxins from C. difficile namely – Toxin A, Toxin B and the binary toxin. Chapter II further focuses on C. difficile binary toxin and other related toxins. These toxins, known as the ADP-ribosylating toxins (ADPRTs) form a big family of potent toxins which includes Cholera, Pertussis and Diphtheria toxins and are capable of transferring the ADP-ribose part of NAD/NADPH to a varity of substrates in the target cell which ultimately results in cell death. The second half of the thesis comprises of experimental procedures that were carried out during the course of this study and their results. Cloning and expression methods for recombinant CDTa and CDTb in bacterial system followed by their purification are described with the abnormal behaviour exhibited by CDTb (chapter III). We show for the first time that purified CDTa and CDTb can combine to form an active CDT which is cytotoxic to Vero cells (Chapter IV). The purification processes described yielded milligram quantities of binary toxin fragments of high purity that led to the successful crystallisation of the proteins (chapter IV) for further functional and structural studies. High resolution crystal structures of CDTa in its native form (at pH 4.0, 8.5 and 9.0) and in complex with the ADP ribose donors -NAD and NADPH (at pH 9.0) have been determined (chapter V). The crystal structures of the native protein show ‘pronounced conformational flexibility’ confined to the active site region of the protein and ‘enhanced’ disorder at low pH while the complex structures highlight significant differences in ‘ligand specificity’ compared with the enzymatic subunit of a close homologue, Clostridium perfringens Iota toxin (Ia). These structural data provide the first detailed information on protein-donor substrate complex stabilisation in CDTa which may have implications in understanding CDT recognition. Crystallisation of CDTb yielded preliminary crystals. The optimisation of these crystallisation conditions is underway. The thesis concludes with some thoughts and discussion on future directions of this research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sundriyal, Amit"],"dc:date":"2010-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26920,"sim:weight":0.238089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930158,"sim:weight":0.151911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.145298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929813,"sim:weight":0.113891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.101943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The major side effect of ALA-PDT is the pain experienced during the treatment. Management of treatment-related pain still remains a considerable challenge in patients. Further optimization of the treatment protocol including light source, dose and duration therefore seems crucial to try and alleviate pain. Previous data from this laboratory have demonstrated that ALA-treated human skin fibroblasts become highly sensitive to Ultraviolet A (UVA, 320-400nm)-induced cytotoxicity. In the present study, we provide further evidence that ALA-PDT with UVA is also effective in photokilling of human skin keratinocyte HaCaT cells despite their known resistance to UVA. The UVA-mediated damage in ALA-treated skin cells may be due to rapid release of potentially harmful transit labile iron (LI) in cells that in conjunction with increased generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) by endogenously accumulated Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) further exacerbate the oxidative damage in skin cells leading to cell death. We therefore hypothesized that by using UVA as the light source and by fractionating the dose applied into two short pulses with 1h dark interval, the ALA-treated skin cells could be further sensitized to UVA-induced damage, since the first dose of UVA would trigger the formation of ROS and extensive release of LI which in turn would intensify the damage caused by the second challenge dose of UVA. By using a series of UVA split-dose combinations, we could demonstrate that applying short pulses of UVA radiation to ALA-treated skin cells is a fast and efficient way to promote cell death. Furthermore the results of this project highlighted the importance of the first UVA dose in determining the efficiency of cell killing following the second UVA dose. The critical role of iron in exacerbating the UVA-induced damage of ALA-treated cells was confirmed with experiments showing that iron loading of cells with hemin prior to ALA-treatment could further sensitise the keratinocytes to very low doses of UVA. The damaging effects of short pulses of low UVA doses following ALA-treatment can be exploited to provide a rapid mean to improve the effectiveness of ALA-PDT of skin lesions while reducing considerably the therapy time and the discomfort/pain associated with prolonged high intensity visible light treatments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Radka, Tina"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is thought that a region of East-Southeast Asia with year-round transmission acts as a source of antigenic diversity for influenza A and seasonal epidemics in temperate regions make little contribution to antigenic evolution. We use a mathematical model to examine how different transmission regimes affect the evolutionary dynamics of influenza over the lifespan of an antigenic cluster. Our model indicates that, in non-seasonal regions, mutants that cause significant outbreaks appear before the peak of the wild-type epidemic. A relatively large proportion of these mutants spread globally. In seasonal regions, mutants that cause significant local outbreaks appear each year before the seasonal peak of the wild-type epidemic, but only a small proportion spread globally. The potential for global spread is strongly influenced by the intensity of non-seasonal circulation and coupling between non-seasonal and seasonal regions. Results are similar if mutations are neutral, or confer a weak to moderate antigenic advantage. However, there is a threshold antigenic advantage, depending on the non-seasonal transmission intensity, beyond which mutants can escape herd immunity in the non-seasonal region and there is a global explosion in diversity. We conclude that non-seasonal transmission regions are fundamental to the generation and maintenance of influenza diversity owing to their epidemiology. More extensive sampling of viral diversity in such regions could facilitate earlier identification of antigenically novel strains and extend the critical window for vaccine development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, Ben","McHardy,  A.

These measurements have been interpreted by comparison with three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau (GL) calculations for nanowires with our sample parameters. We find that the measured superheating field and the critical field for surface superconductivity are strongly influenced by the temperature-dependent coherence length, xi(T) and penetration depth lambda(T) and their relationship to the nanowire diameter. As the temperature is increased toward T-c this drives a change in the superconductor-normal transition from first order irreversible to first order reversible and finally second order reversible. We find that the geometrical flux confinement in our type-I nanowires leads to the formation of a one-dimensional row of single-quantum vortices. While GL calculations show a quite uniform distribution of vortices in thin nanowires, clear vortex bunching is found as the diameter increases, suggesting a transition to a more classical type-I behavior. Subtle changes in minor magnetization loops also indicate that slightly different flux configurations can form with the same vorticity, which depend on the sample history.","bibo:AuthorList":["Engbarth, Miles A","Bending, Simon J","Milosevic, M V"],"dc:date":"2011-06-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2810790,"sim:weight":0.470408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1562287,"sim:weight":0.446811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11790,"sim:weight":0.278126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9733,"sim:weight":0.265392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28947,"sim:weight":0.260425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26706,"sim:weight":0.238224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66463,"sim:weight":0.225814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24010,"sim:weight":0.207053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.194757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5845139,"sim:weight":0.18471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27227,"sim:weight":0.184213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.177194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26270,"sim:weight":0.164226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.15899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85497,"sim:weight":0.148486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27093,"sim:weight":0.126135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85659,"sim:weight":0.101086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The ILA supplies the afferent arteriole and ranges in diameter from \u003e100 µm near its origin at the arcuate artery to \u003c30 µm at its most distal segment. Methods and Results: Vasodilatory responses to elevated extracellular K(+) (15 mmol/L) and vasoconstrictor responses due to K(IR) blockade by Ba(2+) (10-100 µmol/L) were assessed in in vitro perfused hydronephrotic rat kidneys. The distal ILA (26±1 μm) exhibited K(+)-induced dilation and Ba(2+)-induced vasoconstriction; whereas, neither response was observed in the proximal ILA (108±3 µm). The intermediate ILA (55±1 µm) exhibited a modest K(+)-induced vasodilatation, but no Ba(2+)-induced vasoconstriction. The K(+)-induced dilations were blocked by Ba(2+), but not by ouabain. Ba(2+)-induced depolarization, measured in ILA segments from normal kidneys, decreased with the increasing diameter. Patch clamp studies demonstrated that the K(IR) current (I(KIR)) density also was inversely correlated with ILA segment diameter. Myocytes from afferent arterioles and distal ILAs exhibited similarly large I(KIR), whereas, this current was absent in proximal ILA myocytes. Finally, we found that Ba(2+) attenuated myogenic vasoconstriction, suggesting an involvement of I(KIR). The previously shown pattern of myogenic reactivity of the ILA (distal \u003e intermediate \u003e proximal) mirrors the distribution of I(KIR) reported in the present study, further supporting a role for I(KIR). Conclusions: Our findings indicate differences in the magnitude of I(KIR) along the ILA and suggest that the influence of K(IR) on reactivity increases as vessel diameter decreases from proximal to distal regions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chilton, Lisa","Smirnov, Sergey V","Loutzenhiser, Kathy","Wang, Xuemei","Loutzenhiser, Rodger"],"dc:date":"2011-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":712184,"sim:weight":0.125542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.0737946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0604986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The idea at the centre of the paper is a distinction between ‘learning-in-action’ and ‘learning inaction’. The phrase ‘learning-in-action’ represents the value of action learning and much of what we know about the productive relationship between learning and practice. For example, we know that action learning can provide a generative learning model for improvements in practice. Membership of an action learning set can assist individuals in the development of strategic actions, which then can be tested and potentially transformed in practice. However, there is another dynamic that is having an effect on learning and the transformation of practice within action learning. This is called ‘learning inaction’ because participants in learning sets also have (conscious and unconscious) knowledge, fantasies and perceptions about when it is emotionally and politically expedient to refrain from action, when to avoid collective action, and the organizational dynamics that underpin a failure to act. Organizational members are often aware of the political limits of learning within organizations without having to be told; we collude with others in order to create limitations on learning and we are often aware of what is and is not going to be seen as a legitimate result of our attempts to learn. We know these things at the same time as we are engaged in action learning. These developments in theory are related to practice through a focus on four action learning sets within the UK Health Service.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vince, Russ"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The fate of Russian literature became a hotly debated topic after 1991 and among academics and literary critics fears about its quality were widespread. In the immediate post-Soviet period, all eyes were focused on Russia’s writers, and in the light of the new-found political freedom, many commentators, both Western and Russian, eagerly anticipated the emergence of new, even greater Russian literature. When this ‘new’ Russian literature failed to appear in the forms that the intelligentsia expected, and poor quality, mass-produced ‘trash’ gained supremacy in the book market, many declared Russian literature dead and turned away to explore other aspects of post-Soviet life. As a result, since the mid-1990s, there has been comparatively less written about Russian literature and the predictions of the early part of the first post-Soviet decade have not, to a greater or lesser extent, been revisited. This thesis seeks to provide further information about the ways in which the Russian literary scene has changed between 1996 and 2008, after the intense scrutiny of the outside world diminished and commentators became occupied with other aspects of post-Soviet life and leisure time. In an attempt to understand the way in which the changing political and economic landscape has affected the role that literature plays in Russia, this thesis draws on a number of case studies to provide a picture of the Russian literary scene between 1996 and 2008. Chapter One explores the changing face of the book market through the experiences of three publishing houses: Eksmo, Raduga and Feniks, each of which has different origins and has navigated the uncharted waters of an emerging market economy with relative degrees of success. Chapter Two focuses on the ‘thick’ literary journals. The ‘thick’ journals played an active role in the Soviet Union, particularly in the latter part of the 1980s, when the circulation of each publication soared as readers sought to keep abreast of the latest developments socially, politically and culturally. Novyi mir (New world) and Znamya (Banner) are the case studies in Chapter Two, and their changing fortunes are explored in the context of the Soviet era and in comparison to the ‘glossy’ journal, Afisha (Billboard), which has been published in Russia since 1999. No study of Russian literature would be complete without some consideration of the influence of politics on the sorts of texts that are published. Chapter Three questions the extent to which the Putin regime represented a return to a ‘cult of personality’, a phrase that started to reappear on the pages of Russia’s newspapers when Putin came to power. Texts by three authors: Dmitrii Bykov (1967- ); Viktor Teterin (1981- ); and Maksim Kononenko (1971- ) are used in order to explore how far literature and politics remain intertwined even in an era when there is so-called democracy operating within Russia. The fourth chapter investigates how the role of the writer has changed since 1996, and the ways in which popular literary genres have risen to prominence in spite of the intelligentsia’s attempts to preserve the quality of literature. The experiences of writers Boris Akunin (1956- ) and Oksana Robski (1968- ), along with their respective series The Adventures of Erast Fandorin (1998 to the present) and Ca$ual (2005) and Ca$ual 2 (2007) will be examined in Chapter Four. All translations from Russian, with the exception of The Adventures of Erast Fandorin (1998- ) and Ca$ual (2005), are my own. A modified version of the British Standard system of transliteration without diacritics is used. In the text, surnames ending in ‘yi’ and ‘ii’ are rendered as ‘y’, and the surnames of prominent figures, such as Yeltsin, and well-known Russian terms such as glasnost appear in the familiar, rather than in the more strictly transliterated forms. However, when quoting directly from other sources, parity has been retained with the original, even if this means rendering the same term differently owing to differences in the system of transliteration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shelton, Joanne M"],"dc:date":"2010-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It argues that education is rarely directly implicated in the incidence of violent conflict but identifies three main mechanisms through which education can indirectly accentuate or mitigate the risk of conflict: through the creation and maintenance of socio-economic divisions, including horizontal inequalities between ethnic groups; through processes of political inclusion and exclusion; and through accommodation of cultural diversity. It further suggests that designing conflict-sensitive education systems is particularly problematic because the implications of these three principal mechanisms often pull in different directions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brown, Graham"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Knowledge of health risks of smoking and passive smoking was high; radio was the main source of such information. Most people work and \u0026#47; or spend time in places where smoking is permitted. There was very strong support (97%) for comprehensive smoke-free legislation, particularly among Christians and Muslims. Despite the advertising ban, a third of respondents (35%), particularly in urban areas, had noticed advertising of tobacco or tobacco products, on the radio (72%) and television (28%). Among smokers, 76% had attempted to quit in the last 6 months, with the main sources of advice being friends and spouses. Use of nicotine replacement therapy was very rare. Low levels of health awareness were seen in females compared with males (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR); 0.51, 95% CI 0.39-0.69, p \u0026lt; 0.001).

This latter mechanism is modeled in finite element calculations which serve to illustrate the creation of hysteresis in a range of circumstances that go from conventionally hysteretic systems, a sandstone, to systems like a wood fiber. An essential ingredient in the behavior of these systems, the interaction between the mechanical variables and the fluid variables, is accorded special attention.

Until recently, the MHC of passerine birds was not well-described. However, the genome sequencing of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) has partially redressed this gap in our knowledge of avian MHC genes. Here, we contribute further to the understanding of the zebra finch MHC organization by mapping SNPs within or close to known MHC genes in the zebra finch genome. MHC class I and IIB genes were both mapped to zebra finch chromosome 16, and there was no evidence that MHC class I genes are located on chromosome 22 (as suggested by the genome assembly). We confirm the location in the MHC region on chromosome 16 for several other genes (BRD2, FLOT1, TRIM7.2, GNB2L1, and CSNK2B). Two of these (CSNK2B and FLOT1) have not previously been mapped in any other bird species.

The dispersion relation is derived and the neutral stability curves are obtained for a wide range of horizontal flow rates. The presence of the horizontal flow alters the morphology of the neutral curves from that which occurs when there is no flow and travelling modes may arise.

We reformulate the problem in terms of articulating the sought-after properties, which may include both mathematical equivalence and algebraic form.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bradford, Russell","Davenport, James H.","Sangwin, C."],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1512635,"sim:weight":0.24025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87405,"sim:weight":0.235212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147733,"sim:weight":0.208177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86312,"sim:weight":0.19771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23669,"sim:weight":0.196852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999162,"sim:weight":0.193265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671624,"sim:weight":0.17609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931886,"sim:weight":0.101163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Time-accurate measurements of membrane deformation were combined with the flow field measurements. Analysis of the fluctuating deformation reveals chordwise and spanwise modes, which are due to the shedding of leading-edge vortices as well as tip vortices. At higher angles of attack, the second mode in the chordwise direction becomes dominant as the vortex shedding takes place. The dominant frequencies of the membrane vibrations are similar to those of two-dimensional membrane airfoils. Measured frequency of vortex shedding from the low aspect ratio rigid wing suggests that membrane vibrations occur at the natural frequencies close to the harmonics of the wake instabilities. Vortex shedding frequency from rigid wings shows remarkably small effect of aspect ratio even when it is as low as unity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rojratsirikul, Pinunta","Genc, M.

It follows the introduction of extra load into the column through the axial restraint of the surrounding cooler structure and the consequential buckling. Key to this understanding is the post-failure behaviour and re-stabilisation of the column, which is discussed with reference to a finite element model and an analytical model. Through bi-directional control of the temperature, the finite element model allows the snap-back behaviour to be modelled in detail and the effects of varying slenderness and load ratio are investigated. The analytical model employs structural mechanics to describe the behaviour of a heated strut, and is capable of explaining both elastic and fully plastic post-buckling behaviour. Through this detailed explanation of what happens when a heated column buckles, the consequences for steel-framed building design are discussed. In particular, the need to provide robustness is highlighted, in order to ensure that alternative load paths are available once a column has buckled and re-stabilised. Without this robustness, the dynamic shedding of load onto surrounding structures may well spread failure from a fire\u0027s origin and lead to progressive collapse.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shepherd, Paul G.","Burgess,  I.

Coupling has been extended to dibrominated aryl and alkyl compounds as well as showing that aryl-alkyl coupling is possible. Dibrominated alkyls were found to give low molecular weight oligomers although no reaction occurred for 1,2-isomers. The growth of oligomers in THF may be solubility limited.

The torque activation profiles were varied in order to obtain matching simulations for two jumping performances (one for height and one for distance) by an elite male high jumper, resulting in a simulated peak height of 1.98 m and a simulated horizontal distance of 4.38 m. The peak height reached/horizontal distance travelled by the mass centre for the same corresponding initial conditions were then maximised by varying the activation timings resulting in a peak height of 2.09 m and a horizontal distance of 4.67 m. In a further two optimizations the initial conditions were interchanged giving a peak height of 1.82 m and a horizontal distance of 4.04 m. The four optimised simulations show that even with similar approach speeds the initial conditions at touchdown have a substantial effect on the resulting performance. Whilst the takeoff phase is clearly important, unless the approach phase and the subsequent touchdown conditions are close to optimal then a jumper will be unable to compensate for touchdown condition shortcomings during the short takeoff phase to achieve a performance close to optimum.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, Cassie","King, Mark A","Yeadon, Maurice R"],"dc:date":"2011-08-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

International schools are one of many vehicles for the delivery of international education and are growing in number and variety. In addition, the value placed by society on an international education and those curricular programs that promote international education continue to develop. International schools are, therefore, becoming an important and growing area of education. In general terms the amount of research on such schools is limited when compared to national education systems and national schools. The growth in the number of international schools has been accompanied by a growth in the variety of such schools and the diversity of foundations, governance models and missions that support them. This diversity and my experience in international school leadership, allied to my interest in school improvement and school effectiveness as it pertains to the field of international schools, led to an interest in how models of governance impact on international school leadership and – through the leadership – on school improvement and development. This research enquiry is a case study, based on evidence produced through three different research methods; individual school studies, a questionnaire and expert interviews. The use of three methods of data gathering allowed for a complex area to be examined and the results to be triangulated. The results of the case study serve to illuminate the area and to suggest future avenues of research. One area of particular interest that was identified through the study was the interaction within the leadership structures of the schools and the relationships between the head of school, governors and model of governance. It would appear from the results of the study that those models of governance that relied on high numbers of elected parents of students currently attending the school produced a much higher turnover of heads and chairs of boards than did others. The interaction between head, chair of the school board and overall board members also appeared to affect the length of time people served in these posts. Following discussion of such issues, the implications of governance model and rate of turnover for the leadership, development and improvement of international schools are further examined and discussed. The process of conducting this enquiry, while time consuming and demanding, has been of huge benefit to me both personally and professionally.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses data from a UK major food importer and retailer to correlate carbon emissions from transport, and transport-related storage, with food miles by creating farm-specific mode-weighted emission factors. Findings – The correlation is found to be poor for a wide range of products and locations and it is clear that the mode of transport is as important as the distance, with sourcing from parts of the Mediterranean resulting in emissions greater than those from the Americas. Practical implications – It is concluded that it is difficult to justify the use of food miles when attempting to influence purchasing behaviour. Because of this result, processes and tools have been developed that relay information on true transport-related carbon emissions to customers and bulk purchasers that allow them to make informed decisions. Originality/value – This paper questions the value of using the concept of food miles as a driving force for changing purchasing behaviour by either the customer or the purchasing department of a retailer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coley, David A","Howard, Mark","Winter, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176853,"sim:weight":0.392923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85837,"sim:weight":0.224314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585490,"sim:weight":0.209513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26013,"sim:weight":0.197295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26012,"sim:weight":0.197295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58828,"sim:weight":0.179581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56573,"sim:weight":0.17685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.173928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

DSCs were fabricated on conducting glass substrates that were patterned by laser ablation of the fluorine-doped tin oxide coating to form parallel contact strips separated by uncontacted strips of the same width. The relative collection efficiency was measured as a function of the gap between the contact strips, which determines the lateral distance traveled by electrons to reach the contacts. To avoid complications arising from nonlinear recombination kinetics, current measurements were performed using small amplitude perturbations of the electron density close to open circuit and the maximum power point to minimize electron density gradients in the film. One and two-dimensional solutions of the continuity equation for electron transport and back reaction predict that the relative collection efficiency should fall as spacing between the contact strips exceeds the electron diffusion length and electrons are lost by back electron transfer during transit to the contacts. Measurements of the relative collection efficiency were fitted to the predicted dependence of the collection efficiency on the spacing between the contact strips to obtain the value of the electron diffusion length. The diffusion length is found to increase with voltage both at open circuit and at the maximum power point.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dunn, Halina K","Westin, Per-Oskar","Staff, Daniel R","Peter, Laurence M","Walker, Alison B","Boschloo, Gerrit","Hagfeldt, Anders"],"dc:date":"2011-07-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.314473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573481,"sim:weight":0.301749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108299,"sim:weight":0.265869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22874,"sim:weight":0.234849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1562015,"sim:weight":0.230942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108364,"sim:weight":0.226683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108788,"sim:weight":0.221758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176856,"sim:weight":0.207022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26619,"sim:weight":0.202686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85232,"sim:weight":0.191402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108329,"sim:weight":0.18453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109133,"sim:weight":0.182438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.180057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26735,"sim:weight":0.178556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108116,"sim:weight":0.1781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108676,"sim:weight":0.172458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22904,"sim:weight":0.170025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.164287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108874,"sim:weight":0.163702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12226,"sim:weight":0.151176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Some authors have proposed a valuable single-parameter method, the Event-Related Synchronization and Desynchronization (ERS/ERD) approach, for the identification of motor-related power modulation in each EEG frequency band. Under evolving experimental conditions (such as learning or adaptation), though, the repetition of a motor scheme becomes time-variant, and the employment of single-parameter descriptors no longer represents the optimal choice. This occurrence is typically found in motor learning and adaptation studies. In this work we compared the performance of the ERS/ERD method with the multi-parametric Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT). Results confirmed the statistically significant equivalence of the two methods in providing indexes of neural synchronization and desynchronization. Moreover, HHT allowed the tracking of frequency shifts in the alpha and beta EEG bands. The two methods were tested on an EEG dataset recorded during a motor adaptation test.","bibo:AuthorList":["Molteni, E.","Ferrari, M.","Preatoni, Ezio","Cimolin, V.","Cerutti, S.","Bianchi, A.

Reaction of anthranilamide with DMFDMA at 150 degrees C for short periods gives mainly quinazolin-4-one. However, prolonged reaction with dimethylformamide di(primary-alkyl)acetals leads to subsequent alkylation at N3. 3-Substituted anthranilamides give 8-substituted 3-alkylquinazolin-4-ones. Condensation of anthranilamides with dimethylacetamide dimethylacetal provides 2,3-dimethylquinazolin-4-ones. In these reactions, the source of the N3-alkyl group is the O-alkyl group of the orthoamides. By contrast, reaction with the more sterically crowded dimethylformamide di(isopropyl)acetal diverts the alkylation to the oxygen, giving 4-isopropoxyquinazolines, along with N3-methylquinazolin-4-ones where the methyl is derived from N-Me of the orthoamides. Reaction of anthranilamide with the highly sterically demanding dimethylformamide di(t-butyl)acetal gives largely quinazolin-4-one, whereas dimethylformamide di(neopentyl)acetal forms a mixture of quinazolin-4-one and N3-methylquinazolin-4-one. The observations are rationalised in terms of formation of intermediate cationic electrophiles (alkoxymethylidene-N,N-dimethylammonium) by thermal elimination of the corresponding alkoxide from the orthoamides. These are the first observations of orthoamides as direct alkylating agents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nathubhai, Amit","Patterson, Richard","Woodman, Timothy J.","Sharp, Harriet E. C.","Chui, Miranda T.

In a culture that emphasises social conformity, it demonstrates the diverse and innovative ways individuals negotiated a shared tradition in a contemporary postmodern context in which a variety of cultural messages compete for attention. Traditional Buddhist mourning rituals that promote family and social solidarity now take their place alongside a medicalised system of dying, commercialised mourning, bereavement counselling and increasing emphasis on individualism and personal choice. Five categories of responses are identified to reflect the different ways the individuals concerned sought to reconcile social and familial obligations associated with traditional approaches with their need to find individual and personal meaning in their loss. Some participants felt obliged to conform to traditional forms from which they took little comfort, while others found them to be supportive and meaningful. Some took an improvisory approach, putting their own personal stamp on received wisdom. Others turned to alternative forms of support, either to supplement or replace traditional approaches. Their responses reflected the complex, dynamic, fluid and ambiguous relationship between the individual and their social and cultural resources, demonstrating the contribution of individuals to shaping culture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Valentine, Christine A"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5225643,"sim:weight":0.341336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.293991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108300,"sim:weight":0.271945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653231,"sim:weight":0.23815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108526,"sim:weight":0.23461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.221126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.219339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.215703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.211828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108935,"sim:weight":0.209073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.207149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.194494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176792,"sim:weight":0.187978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.186852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57364,"sim:weight":0.169131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86074,"sim:weight":0.164187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In fact the great success of photonic crystal fibre is largely due to the ability to structure it on scales comparable to the wavelength of light. It is this micron size structure that allows the creation of an (out of plane) optical bandgap in silica and allows hollow core fibre to guide light in an air core freeing the guided mode from the properties of bulk silica.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis thesis focuses on the propagation and compression of high peak power optical solitons in hollow core fibre. As the Kerr nonlinear response of air is approximately a thousand times less than that of silica, the air core of hollow core fibre can support much higher peak powers than conventional optical fibre without the manifestation of nonlinear effects, making it ideal for the delivery of high peak power laser pulses. Coupled with this, hollow core fibre has a large region of anomalous dispersion in its transmission window allowing optical pulses to be transmitted as temporal solitons freeing them from the effects of dispersion. The author started his Ph.D. in 2006, three years after the first demonstration of soliton propagation in hollow core fibre and as the first demonstrations of soliton compression in hollow core fibre were being undertaken. Work by the author to build upon these early demonstrations is presented in this thesis in the following manner:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eChapters 1, 2 and 3 are theory chapters. Chapter 1 explains the background waveguide theory and theory of nonlinear optics that is used throughout the thesis.

Theoretical models of care predict that selection should favour biparental care if it substantially improves the survival of the offspring. Although various ecological factors have been proposed to necessitate biparental care, experimental evidence is scant given the challenges of manipulating ecological factors in the natural habitat of animals. We carried out one such experiment in a small shorebird, the Kentish plover, Charadrius alexandrinus, that breeds in an extreme desert environment. Nest cover and thus exposure to solar radiation vary between nests, and we show that parents at exposed nests spent more time incubating than those at nests shaded by a bush (covered nests). Experimental removal and supplementation of nest cover gave results consistent with the observational data; at experimentally exposed nests both males and females increased incubation effort and relieved each other more frequently whereas at experimentally covered nests we observed the opposite. We conclude that exposure to extreme solar radiation influences biparental care and this necessitates parental cooperation in the Kentish plover. Furthermore, since parental care often coevolves with mating strategies, we conjecture that where the environment puts less pressure on the parents and provides the opportunity for reduced care, both mating systems and parental care can diversify over evolutionary time.","bibo:AuthorList":["AlRashidi, M","Kosztolanyi, A","Shobrak, M","Kupper, C","Szekely, Tamas"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2805362,"sim:weight":0.493207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2802319,"sim:weight":0.351004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108971,"sim:weight":0.140329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108684,"sim:weight":0.132939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108770,"sim:weight":0.115986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.10984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108766,"sim:weight":0.0863737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Despite 50 years of research, there are still many unanswered questions about its conceptualisation and operationalisation. The authors argue that traditional measures of SDB are inadequate and that the context in which the research is being conducted should be reflected in the measures employed. Hence, the authors develop and validate a multi-dimensional scale that may be used to measure the degree of SDB present in responses to giving surveys. Design/methodology/approach - Following initial scale development procedures a convenience sample of 820 donors to a national charity was employed to refine the resultant scale items. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability tests were conducted to establish the dimensionality of the new scale and its reliability. Using a separate sample of 1,500 active donors, the scale was then subject to confirmatory procedures to test its predictive validity. Findings - The findings support the assertion that SDB is a multi-dimensional construct consisting of six dimensions. However, in the context of postal surveys it is found that self-deception and the degree of intrinsic benefit accruing to a donor are the primary determinants of the level of SDB an individual will exhibit. The authors also highlight the significance of the SDB issue since in the survey reported here, 65 per cent of respondents were found to over-report their giving. Originality/value - This is one of the first published studies that has been able to explore the predictive validity of a SDB scale. The work has expanded our understanding of the determinants of SDB and provided an instrument that may now be employed to reduce a significant proportion of this error in giving surveys.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee,  Z.","Sargeant,  A."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":388776,"sim:weight":0.172353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.163002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.153966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.150566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86024,"sim:weight":0.150153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.149503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We are going to investigate this situation and provide analytical tools as well as their limitations. For power and exponential type multiplier functions with essential zeros we will show by using several numerical approaches that the unbounded inverse of the injective multiplication operator does not influence the local degree of ill-posedness. We provide a conjecture, verified by several numerical studies, how these multiplication operators influence the singular values of A \u003d M о J.\r\n\r\nFinally we analyze the influence of those multiplication operators M on the possibilities of Tikhonov regularization and corresponding convergence rates. We investigate the role of approximate source conditions in the method of Tikhonov regularization for linear and nonlinear ill-posed operator equations. Based on the studies on approximate source conditions we indicate that only integrals of m and not the decay of multiplier functions near zero determines the convergence behavior of the regularized solution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Freitag, Melina A","Hofmann, B"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":70092,"sim:weight":0.312265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24050,"sim:weight":0.28215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85525,"sim:weight":0.250718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147077,"sim:weight":0.250455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21941,"sim:weight":0.227209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573449,"sim:weight":0.222592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.219721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21493,"sim:weight":0.16087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.157307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85358,"sim:weight":0.147943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26023,"sim:weight":0.141892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85751,"sim:weight":0.140464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The use of traditional vernacular techniques has raised the profile of earthen architecture but wider impact is likely to come from commercially produced, thin-walled, earth masonry as a replacement for blockwork, brickwork or timber framed non-structural internal walls. Earth masonry is susceptible to changes in moisture and this paper investigates the potential for early-age cracking from changes in moisture content during the most critical period for these materials, during construction. It is shown that internal stresses generated by moisture driven expansion after rendering may exceed masonry flexural (flexure induced tensile) capacity leading to premature wall failure. This failure mechanism was observed in a test panel and has potential to occur in real walls. Recommendations on how to minimise the risk of early-age cracking are presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heath, Andrew","Walker, Peter","Jaquin, Paul","Lawrence, Mike"],"dc:date":"2012-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In a response to this, the aim of this research is to consider the influence of strategic management, and in particular the role of business strategy, in shaping socially and environmentally responsible purchasing and supply management activities. In examining this theme, this research draws heavily upon recent conceptualisations of the relationship between strategic management and corporate social responsibility, and empirically assesses this relationship with a focus on such practices within the supply chain. Using a novel data collection approach to capture firms’ actual social and environmental supply management activities, these data draw on interviews with 178 UK-based firms and observations of 340 separate buyer-supplier relationships. Primary data were supplemented with secondary data to capture both industry and firm characteristics. This methodology minimises social desirability bias and common source bias. The findings suggest that responsible purchasing and supply management is strongly driven by business strategy in the business to consumer market. In contrast, in the business to business market such initiatives are largely influenced by firms’ financial resources and economic obligations. In both the business to consumer and business to business sector, however, business strategy and financial resources are contingent on the industry environment. Hence, the industry environment plays a significant, albeit indirect, role in shaping socially and environmentally responsible purchasing and supply management activities. This research offers one of the first insights into how strategic management, and in particular how business strategy, influences firms’ investments in socially and environmentally responsible purchasing and supply management initiatives. Through conceptual and empirical investigations this research highlights this relationship and notes the importance of integrating business strategy with general supplier practices, with a focus on the implementation of corporate social responsibility in individual buyer-supplier relationships.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hoejmose, Stefan U"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.255483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.246169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.24015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.235139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58501,"sim:weight":0.202376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As a consequence, public service organisations, especially those considered as poorly-performing organisations, have been subjected to unprecedented pressure to improve their performance and sustain performance improvement as a continuous process. However, efforts of public managers to improve the performance of their organisations have been undertaken without “comprehensive theories and rigorous evidence on this issue” (Boyne, 2006: 366). This thesis takes up the challenge of providing robust evidence on the factors associated with the performance improvement of public organisations. We propose that the notion of organisational capabilities offers a promising way to meet this challenge. From this standpoint, this research sought to identify the organisational capabilities whose development and use explain a public service organisation’s ability to improve its performance and sustain good performance in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe empirical analysis was conducted in a population of hospital trusts in England.

The use of knockout mouse models has given an insight into the role of SHIP-1 in murine T cells, but these are compromised by loss of function during development which impinges upon mature T cell function. In addition, some work has been undertaken to investigate the role of SHIP-1 in human leukaemic T cell lines, but it is not clear how these findings might translate to SHIP1’\r\ns function in normal cells.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore the work in this thesis was undertaken to investigate the role of SHIP-1 in primary human T lymphocytes. Initial experiments demonstrated that SHIP-1 was active both in unstimulated cells and in response to a variety of stimuli. Using a lentiviral method to deliver shRNA against SHIP-1 and a constitutively active form of SHIP-1 it was found that whilst constitutive activation of SHIP-1 led to cell death, silencing of SHIP-1 expression resulted in viable cells which failed to proliferate. Furthermore, silencing of SHIP-1 revealed its crucial role in the regulation of basal PI3K signalling, actin polymerisation, cell morphology and basal motility. Interestingly, there was no additional defect in chemotaxis, in agreement with findings that SHIP-1 and TAPP PH domain probes did not localise to specific regions of the cell membrane during chemotaxis. In addition, silencing of SHIP-1 caused an abnormal profile of cytokine production and in particular, CD4+ T cells were skewed towards becoming Tregs.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe observations in this study suggest that whilst the role of SHIP-1 in primary human T cells has some similarities to its role in both murine T cells and leukaemic cell lines, there are also significant differences which it will be crucial to take into account when designing drugs to target SHIP-1.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe final results section comprises work completed for Novartis, the sponsor of this PhD.

In particular, urban regeneration partnerships such as New Deal for Communities have been designed to promote local resident participation and also to reorient local services to be more closely aligned with resident needs, and thereby to reduce social exclusion. This has presented opportunities for residents to influence local public services; this type of participation outcome has received little attention however. This thesis argues that urban regeneration partnerships can be understood as a type of governance network which create opportunities for resident participation, and that a more detailed understanding of ‘network’ aspects of governing can explain some of the processes and outcomes of resident participation in this context.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe research was carried out through an ethnographic case study of a New Deal for Communities programme, in East Manchester.

Populations of two little-studied South American waders, the Two-banded Plover Charadrius falklandicus and the Rufous-chested Dotterel Charadrius modestus, were monitored over a four-year period at a single island site: in chapters two, three and four this thesis presents information on the diel pattern ofincubation sharing by males and females of both species (the two species showed opposite diel sex-roles), data on morphology including sexual dimorphism (male-biased in both species), breeding systems data including estimates of mate fidelity, and for Two-banded Plovers, demographic estimates including annual survival rates of adults and hatching success of nests. These are among the first detailed studies of the breeding behaviour and life-histories of anysouthern South American waders. Concurrent with the single-site wader study, an inter-islandnatural experimental approach was used to investigate the effects of non-native mammalian predators, firstly on the expression of anti-predator behaviour in the Two-banded Plover (chapter five) and secondly on the relative abundance of populations of an endemic insect, the Falkland Camel Cricket Parudenus falklandicus (chapter six). The latter chapters both infer strong effects of non-native mammalian predators: firstly, Two-banded Plovers expressed much larger flushing distances in response to an approaching (human) stimulus at sites where feral cats Felis catus were present, although flushing distances were shorter when background exposure to humans was relatively high (I interpret these effects as generalisation and habituation respectively). Secondly, the relative abundance of Camel Crickets in a given habitat type was substantially higher in the absence of Norway Rats Rattus norvegicus, regardless of whether the rats were naturally absent orhad been deliberately eradicated. Following the apparently strong effect of rats on insects in the Falkland Islands, in chapter seven I use literature from other island groups to review the effects of invasive rodents on island invertebrate populations; I conclude that negative effects are widespread and non-randomly distributed among invertebrate species, with large invertebrates particularly susceptible to rodent impacts. Finally, in chapter eight, potentially productive areas for future research and synthesis are suggested.","bibo:AuthorList":["St Clair, James J H"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108770,"sim:weight":0.212085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.210923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86207,"sim:weight":0.210595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108390,"sim:weight":0.203602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.189186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.184215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108684,"sim:weight":0.17406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108766,"sim:weight":0.123343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25053,"sim:weight":0.121226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A decrease in relative dielectric permittivity and rise in conductivity, with increasing frequency, was observed at all stages over the time-scale presented. When plotted in the complex plane, the impedance featured a bulk response comprising two depressed semicircles and a low frequency spur, the latter being associated with the electrode/sample interface.

This reduction could be caused by a number of effects that can act to increase or decrease the level of emissions. Decomposition analysis has been used to separate the contributions of changes in output, industrial structure, energy intensity, fuel mix and electricity emission factor to the reduction in carbon emissions. The primary reason for the fall in emissions was found to be a reduction in energy intensity. The manufacturing sector was also split into two subsectors: the energy-intensive (EI) subsector, and the non-energy-intensive (NEI) subsector. The NEI subsector, somewhat surprisingly, was found to have made greater relative reductions in its energy-related carbon emissions over the study period. This was principally due to much greater relative improvements in energy intensity. There is evidence that the EI subsector had made greater relative improvements in energy intensity in the period preceding 1990, and so this may have limited improvements post 1990.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hammond, Geoffrey P","Norman, Jonathan B"],"dc:date":"2012-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":386659,"sim:weight":0.358087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53435,"sim:weight":0.34635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Putelat et al. (2008) demonstrated that equations governing the sliding of two slabs could be approximated by spring-block equations, and studied relaxation oscillations for two slabs driven by uniform relative motion at their outer surfaces, employing this approximation. The present work revisits this problem. The equations of motion are first formulated exactly, with full allowance for wave reflections. Since the sliding is restricted to be independent of position on the interface, this leads to a set of differential-difference equations in the time domain. Formal but systematic asymptotic expansions reduce the equations to differential equations. Truncation of the differential system at the lowest non-trivial order reproduces a classical spring-block system, but with a slightly different \"equivalent mass\" than was obtained in the earlier work. Retention of the next term gives a new system, of higher order, that contains also some explicit effects of wave reflections. The smooth periodic orbits that result from the spring-block system in the regime of instability of steady sliding are \"decorated\" by an oscillation whose period is related to the travel time of the waves across the slabs. The approximating differential system reproduces this effect with reasonable accuracy when the mean sliding velocity is not too far from the critical velocity for the steady state. The differential system also displays a period-doubling bifurcation as the mean sliding velocity is increased, corresponding to similar behaviour of the exact differential-difference system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Putelat,  Thibaut","Willis,  John R.","Dawes, Jonathan H.

Currently, in the UK, there are three main GHG methodologies that potentially affect biofuel producers. Each has a different approach to measure GHG emissions from biofuel production, and each provides a different result, causing difficulties for policy makers.

But while\r\ncoercivity estimates are well known for many variational problems\r\narising from partial differential equations, they are still an open problem in the context of boundary integral operators arising from acoustic scattering problems,\r\nwhere rigorous coercivity results have so far only been established for combined integral operators on the unit circle and sphere. The fact that coercivity holds, even in these special cases, is perhaps surprising, as formulations of Helmholtz problems are generally thought to be indefinite.\r\nThe main motivation for investigating coercivity in this context is that it has the potential to give error estimates for the Galerkin method which are both explicit in the wavenumber $k$ and valid regardless of the approximation space used, thus they apply to hybrid asymptotic-numerical methods recently developed for the high frequency case.\r\nOne way to interpret coercivity is by considering the numerical range of the operator. The numerical range is a well established tool in spectral theory and algorithms exist to approximate the numerical range of finite dimensional matrices. We can therefore use Galerkin projections of the boundary integral operators to approximate the numerical range of the original operator. We prove convergence estimates for the numerical range of Galerkin projections of a general bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space to justify this approach. By computing the numerical range of the combined integral operator in acoustic scattering for several interesting convex, nonconvex, smooth, and polygonal domains, we numerically study coercivity estimates for varying wavenumbers. We find that coercivity holds, uniformly in the wavenumber $k$, for a wide variety of domains. Finally, we consider a trapping domain, for which there exist resonances (also called scattering poles) very close to the real line, to demonstrate that coercivity for a certain wavenumber $k$ seems to be strongly dependent on the distance to the nearest resonance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Betcke, Timo","Spence, Euan"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Moreover, the coercivity is uniform in the wavenumber k \u003d ω/c, where ω is the frequency and c  is the speed of sound.

Additionally, to the authors\u0027 knowledge, it is the only second-kind integral operator for which convergence of the Galerkin method in L2(Γ) is proved without smoothness assumptions on Γ except that it is Lipschitz. The coercivity of the star-combined operator implies frequency-explicit error bounds for the Galerkin method for any approximation space. In particular, these error estimates apply to several hybrid asymptoticnumerical methods developed recently that provide robust approximations in the high-frequency case.

China’s entrance to the WTO in 2001 brought and will continue to bring significant impacts on China’s economic, political and social development. Under pressure from the developed countries, China reformed its IPRs protection in order to accede to the WTO. There was heated debate on whether stronger IPRs protection was beneficial for developing countries’ technological progress. This research investigated the impact of IPRs protection reform arising from WTO accession on technology diffusion in China. Fieldwork was the main method of this research. Semi-structured interview, self-completion questionnaire, official statistics and other sources such as television programs, interviews with government officials were used to collect data. The research found that its entrance to the WTO urged China to reform its IPRs protection. IPRs reform had both positive and negative impacts on technology diffusion. The impact of IPRs reform on technology diffusion in China varied in different industries, sizes and legal status of firms. Other relevant policies, such as the “Open Door” policy, economic development policies, research and development (R\u0026D) policies, foreign investment policies, China’s big market and industry development policies also influenced the impact of IPRs on technology diffusion. The importance of this research was based on the fact that it was the first research on the impact of IPRs reform on technology diffusion in China which disseminated unique and original information. Currently most Chinese policy-makers intend to implement stronger IPRs policy, without a comprehensive knowledge of the disadvantages of IPRs in technology diffusion. This research will help future policy making as it provided information on the limitations of the current IPRs system, which has not been a matter of concern to the Chinese policy-makers so far.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meng, Wei"],"dc:date":"2009-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109132,"sim:weight":0.234586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.196393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.190265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85356,"sim:weight":0.161246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.161012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108496,"sim:weight":0.146862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929894,"sim:weight":0.090997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although initially defined as a tumor suppressor, WT1 has been found to be overexpressed in some cancers.

Recent studies have shown an abundance of bidirectional transcription across metazoan genomes suggesting that non-coding antisense transcripts may have important roles in cell function. WT1-AS transcripts are capable of positively modulating WT1 protein levels in vitro, but relatively little is known about the functions of these antisense transcripts in vivo. The aim of this thesis was to characterize the role of a highly conserved region, Mcr2, located upstream of human and mouse WT1. Our data suggests that Mcr2 is not translated into protein and is transcribed in an antisense orientation. Mcr2 was found partially conserved in fish and well conserved in terrestrial vertebrates. By analysing novel mouse strains with genetically modified Mcr2 we have identified that Mcr2 may have a role in both fertility and embryonic survival, as well as regulating liquid homeostasis in the adult mouse.","bibo:AuthorList":["Menchaca, T.

Many flowering plants are polyploids and seeds developed from crosses between individuals of different ploidies usually show abnormal features and often abort. The success or failure of interploidy crosses is very important to understanding the evolution of plants as well as to agriculture, but much remains to be learned about the nature of hybridisation barriers. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain postzygotic barriers, including negative interactions between diverged sequences, global genome rearrangements, and widespread epigenetic reprogramming. Some recent advances in our understanding of the process of hybridisation are derived from different experimental studies on a series of A. thaliana ecotypes. Crosses between diploid (2x) and tetraploid (4x) individuals of the same ecotype can result in F1 lethality, and this dosage-sensitive incompatibility plays a major role in polyploidy speciation research. We have performed interploidy crosses between different diploid maternal A. thaliana ecotypes and tetraploid paternal Col-0 ecotype and identified a genetic variation in F1 lethality. We also found that maternal parents of some ecotypes such as Tsu-1 suppressed the F1 lethality caused by paternal-excess interploidy cross of Col-0 ecotype. A preliminary mapping exercise produced advanced backcross populations that are suitable for mapping maternal modifiers and for the identification of modifier genes. Furthermore, we studied the killer effect caused by Col-0 and identified three additive QTL that affect the rate of postzygotic lethality in F1 during interploidy crosses. This information will facilitate the identification of paternal genes that cause F1 lethality and contribute to reproductive isolation.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe moa-1 (mosaic aneuploidy 1) mutant of A. thaliana was obtained in a screen of chemically (EMS) mutagenised seeds of Landsberg erecta (Ler). moa-1 has various phenotypic differences to wild type; the preliminary karyotype analysis showed that the cells of individual moa-1 mutant plants have a variable number of chromosomes (usually between 11-18).

Recent studies showed that glucose restriction extends the lifespan of C. elegans while excessive glucose shortens the lifespan of the worms. The first step of the glucose metabolism is the transport of glucose across the plasma membrane by the glucose transporters. The work described in this thesis aims to identify glucose transporters in C. elegans and to provide a primary investigation of the in vitro and in vivo function of the identified glucose transporter. Nine putative transporters have been cloned and expressed. Out of the nice cloned putative transporters in the C. elegans genome, H17B01.1 (H17) only is identified as a fully functional glucose transporter using an oocyte expression system in which glucose transport activity is directly measured. The two transcripts of H17 are both capable of transporting glucose with high affinity, as well as transporting trehalose. Heterologous expression of H17 in mammalian CHO-T cells suggests that the protein is localised both on the plasma membrane and in the cytosol. In vitro studies of H17 show that the protein does not respond to insulin stimulation when expressed in mammalian CHO-T cell and rat primary adipocyte systems. In vivo functional studies using H17 RNAi indicate that the worm’s lifespan is not affected by the H17 knockdown. However, glucose metabolism of C. elegans (as measured by glucose oxidation to CO2 and incorporation into fat reserves) is influenced by the decreased expression of H17, especially in the daf-2 mutant strain, e1370. However, the increase of glucose metabolism caused by H17 knockdown observed in daf-2 mutant is inhibited in the age-1 and akt-1 mutant strains. The findings reported in this thesis suggest that the H17 glucose transporter may play an important role glucose metabolism in C. elegans and that this transport and metabolism is influenced by insulin receptor activity and serine kinase cascades.","bibo:AuthorList":["Feng, Ying"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.120811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.100058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108070,"sim:weight":0.0924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0820551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.0701941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Specifically, the focus has been on: ideas, interests and struggles for resources between political leaders and bureaucrats believed to be taking place at the expense of the poor; ill-informed and unrealistic development policies and strategies; anti-development behaviour and tendencies of the peasants and their alleged conservatism and resistance to modernity, and weak incentive structures of the economy. There is little focus on the character and dynamics of the (historical) institutional context in which these economic conditions, struggles and policy initiatives emerge and take place.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMotivated by the disappointing results of anti-poverty initiatives and weaknesses of previous studies, this study uses historical institutional impact analysis guided by institutionalist theory to analyse the problem. The central argument is that the existence and functioning character of institutions are necessary conditions for any human development activity. So, acceptance of the crucial importance of historically oriented institutional context analysis in understanding poverty alleviation initiatives and outcomes is imperative. The study draws on primary and secondary data collected through documentary review and interview methods to explain the ways in which institutional reforms result in an institutional order tolerant of poverty and which create conditions that perpetuate it. It does this by exploring the mode of historical institutional development and by examining the functioning character of the institutional order in respect of poverty alleviation. The study argues that achieving success in poverty alleviation related reforms is dependent on proper understanding of institutional realities of Tanzanian society and the functioning character of the existing institutional order. It proposes a reform process in which institutional legacies and their impact on society become the focus of the reform process itself.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe findings indicate that, while reforms and policy changes have taken place and new patterns of behaviour introduced, the logics of institutions central to development and poverty alleviation have not, been fundamentally altered and new patterns of behaviour have simply perpetuated it. Specifically, the findings suggest: first, that institutional reforms pursued by the government are inadequate due to misconception of institutional problems of Tanzanian society; second, that the reforms have created new conditions which perpetuate poverty; and, third, that fundamental character of the functioning of the Tanzanian institutional order will need to change before such anti-poverty measures can hope to succeed. Thus, the study offers a correction to ill-informed poverty analysis by providing an alternative account of the root cause of poverty while insisting that a better understanding of the failure of poverty alleviation requires a strong focus on the historical institutional realties of the country.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Sansa, Godfrey"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108670,"sim:weight":0.372136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.209487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Building on previous work published in this journal by the authors, this study was undertaken to improve the operating range, accuracy and usability of the original model as well as introducing the ability to model twin skin exhaust sections with an air gap. Convective heat transfer relationships for nine stainless steel exhaust bend sections of varying wall thicknesses and radiuses were experimentally characterised over a range of steady state conditions. In each case a correlation between observed Reynolds number (Re) and Nusselt number (Nu) was developed. Based on measured experimental data, a generic model was built using Matlab/Simulink capable of predicting the relationship between Nusselt number and Reynolds number for previously unseen pipe geometries falling within the experimental design range. To further develop the usefulness of the model, fifteen twin skin test sections, intended to represent a range of geometries applicable to production automotive gasoline exhaust systems, were also fabricated and characterised. Within the model, both skins of each pipe section were split into five axial and radial elements with the inner and outer skins linked via the modelling of free convection and radiation between them. The predicted Reynolds-Nusselt relationships for each bend section and twin skin configuration were validated using transient experimental data over a portion of the US06 drive cycle. The final model demonstrated improved accuracy of exhaust gas temperature predictions, compared with previous model iterations, with typical errors of less than 1% and a mean error over the US06 cycle of +0.2%.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bannister, Christopher D","Brace, Christian J","Taylor, J","Brooks, T","Fraser, N"],"dc:date":"2011-05-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85046,"sim:weight":0.223819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85528,"sim:weight":0.221691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931561,"sim:weight":0.22011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85283,"sim:weight":0.218935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108096,"sim:weight":0.179981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316480,"sim:weight":0.167509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57302,"sim:weight":0.164462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53534,"sim:weight":0.163317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651854,"sim:weight":0.14107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176817,"sim:weight":0.135692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9563,"sim:weight":0.115264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The four studies included in this thesis were designed to contribute to our understanding of why participation in leisure time\r\nexercise declines during adolescence. In particular, the studies aimed to test a proposed pathway of effects between negative body or weight related self perceptions\r\nand engagement in volitional exercise through the application of self determination theory (SDT; Deci \u0026amp; Ryan, 2000). The roles of extrinsic goal content, need satisfaction and motivation on leisure time\r\nexercise (LTE) were tested at both a crosssectional\r\nand longitudinal level, and analysed in detail through a qualitative study. A final experimental study was then conducted to test the degree to which some of these observed constructs are open to change, and to explore whether focusing adolescents on exercising for goals of physical appearance in a single exercise session (PE) would be facilitative of involvement in PE through heightening its relevance, or inhibitive of self determined\r\nmotivation through the pathway of effects predicted for extrinsic goals by SDT.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWeight related\r\nphysical self perceptions\r\n(WRPSPs)\r\nwere found to compromise need satisfaction and motivation to predict poorer LTE and quality of life one year later, suggesting that the reduction of, or distraction from WRPSPs\r\nwould form a useful basis for exercise interventions. Adolescents showed resilience to extrinsic goals and motives for exercise, which were found to have a positive additive effect on behaviour, motivation and perceived value of activities when present in combination with intrinsic goals and motives for exercise. These findings indicated that a hierarchy of goals exists, such that goals for individual bouts of exercise are less important in determining the outcomes an adolescent will experience, than goals for exercise overall. The findings divert somewhat from SDT to suggest that when combined with a basis of intrinsic motivation towards exercise, the introduction of a highly relevant, yet extrinsic goals may be useful in initiating (although not necessarily maintaining) effortful goal directed behaviour in adolescence.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Gillison, Fiona B."],"dc:date":"2007-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108547,"sim:weight":0.239279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.146285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This work reveals that microstructural network models more closely represent a porous ferroelectric microstructure since they are able to take into account the complex polarization distribution in the material due to the presence of high and low permittivity regions. The modelling approach enables the prediction of the distribution of poled and unpoled material within the structure. The hydrostatic figures of merit and permittivity were determined for a variety of porous lead zirconate titanate microstructures and found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The decrease in piezoelectric activity with porosity was observed to be associated with the complex polarization state within the material.

Using a clinico-serological approach DM and PM can be defined into more homogeneous subsets. Myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) are directed against cytoplasmic or nuclear components involved in key regulatory intra-cellular processes including protein synthesis, translocation and gene transcription.

This epithelium is called the trophectoderm in mammals, the superficial layer in Xenopus and the enveloping layer in zebrafish. This project investigates what promotes differentiation of this cell type. In Xenopus embryos aPKC and Notch signalling were found to be unable to promote differentiation of the superficial layer. In contrast, BMP signalling can promote expression of a number of transcriptional regulators, including members of the Grhl and Msx families and differentiation of the superficial layer. This pathway is initiated in the underlying deep cells, but not all target genes are activated so differentiation does not occur in these cells. The role of BMP signalling in mouse development was investigated by using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) as the model. BMP4 is sufficient to induce mESCs to form a polarised epithelial cell type and that these epithelial cells appear trophoblast in fate. BMP signalling activates Grhl and Msx genes in mESCs, as it does in Xenopus embryos. This suggests that similar target genes are activated by BMP signalling in the first epithelium of Xenopus and mouse. Based on this data it is tempting to propose that BMP signalling acts in a conserved manor to promote differentiation of the first epithelium in diverse vertebrates.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wei, Jun"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.205557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Roaccutane (13-cis-retinoic acid, 13-cis-RA) is a synthetic retinoid used for the treatment of severe cystic acne, although its use has been controversially associated with adverse psychiatric events including depression. In this thesis, the presence of retinoid receptors in the rat hippocampus was verified and a similar profile of expression was observed in the rat raphe nuclei for the first time. The expression of retinoid receptors in brain regions that are implicitly associated with depression pathology provides proof of concept for retinoids to influence depressive behaviour. The ability of 13-cis-RA treatment to induce a pro-depressive profile in animal models of depression-related behaviour was tested. In the resident-intruder paradigm, adult rats treated for 7 or 14 days with 13-cis-RA (1mg/kg, i.p.) showed reduced aggressive behaviour, with a concomitant increase in flight submit and flight escape behaviours, compared with vehicle-treated controls. These findings are indicative of increased depression-related behaviour. However, chronic treatment did not alter depression-related behaviour in the forced swim test and sucrose consumption anhedonia paradigms The molecular mechanisms mediating 13-cis-RA-induced depression were investigated by examining monoaminergic gene expression, protein levels and neurotransmitter levels in rat brain tissue and plasma and an in vitro model. The majority of serotonergic components (SERT, 5-HT1AR, 5-HT1BR and MAOA) were not altered by chronic 13-cis-RA treatment, with the possible exception of TPH2 gene/protein expression and increased 5-HT levels in platelets. In fact, the expression of D2 dopamine receptor was significantly elevated in the RN46A-B14 cell line (10μM 13-cis-RA, 48 h) and was similarly elevated at the protein level in the juvenile rat hippocampus (1mg/kg/day, i.p., 6 weeks), suggesting dopaminergic pathways may be of importance.

Unlike for other living organisms, fertilisation involves the fusion of two sperm cells to two cell types of female gametophyte, the egg and central cell. This fertilization process is called double fertilisation. Fusion of the egg and the sperm yields a zygote whereas the interaction of the central cell and the sperm gives the nutritive endosperm. This fertilization process has been studied extensively for many years. However, despite these studies, relatively little is known at the molecular level about either of the plant gametes. This is primarily due to the difficulties in plant gamete isolation. Both plant gametes reside within enclosed tissues, pollen grains and embryo sacs. In this study, sperm isolation techniques were successfully developed for Brassica oleracea and Arabidopsis thaliana which ultimately utilised fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to obtain pure cell samples. Proteomic studies utilising two-dimensional protein electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS) were carried out on both semi-purified and FACS-purified sperm cells. In parallel with the proteomic studies a bioinformatics approach was taken which used sperm transcriptome data of maize, Plumbago zeylanica, rice and tobacco to identify homologues in Arabidopsis. Transcriptional analyses, RT-PCR and GFP translational fusion experiments were used to investigate these Arabidopsis sperm cell-expressed gene candidates. As a result, two sperm cell-expressed genes (At1g10090 and At5g39650) were identified and these are being analysed to confirm their functions in the reproductive process. Moreover, the sperm cell-expressed gene candidates derived from the bioinformatics were also screened for roles in plant reproduction by a reverse genetics approach (Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutagenesis plant screening) and eight genes were identified. In addition, for the first time, sperm cell size dimorphism was identified for Arabidopsis in this study utilising a GFP-labelled sperm line and confocal microscopy. Overall the techniques for sperm cell-expressed gene candidate selection were proven to be effective and will certainly facilitate further sperm cell-specific gene identification studies. Further the Arabidopsis sperm purification technique successfully developed in this project will surely be useful for any plant sperm cell studies in the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sriboonlert, Ajaraporn"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26919,"sim:weight":0.163059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26918,"sim:weight":0.161961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84807,"sim:weight":0.159264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.142234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80376,"sim:weight":0.141632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.137937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.137651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24544,"sim:weight":0.133412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This has been addressed repeatedly in research studies focusing on different aspects of uncertainty; unfortunately, this interest has not yet been adopted in practice. One reason can be found in the inadequate representation of uncertainty. This paper introduces an experiment, which engages different approaches to displaying cost forecasting information to gauge the consideration of uncertainty in the subsequent decision-making process. Three different approaches of displaying cost-forecasting information including the uncertainty involved in the data were tested, namely a three point trend forecast, a bar chart, and a FAN-diagram. Furthermore, the effects of using different levels of contextual information about the decision problem were examined. The results show that decision makers tend to simplify the level of uncertainty from a possible range of future outcomes to the limited form of a point estimate. Furthermore, the contextual information made the participants more aware of uncertainty. In addition, the fan-diagram prompted 75.0% of the participants to consider uncertainty even if they had not used this type of diagram before; it was therefore identified as the most suitable method of graphical information display for encouraging decision makers to consider the uncertainty in cost forecasting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kreye, Melanie N","Goh, Yee Mey","Newnes, Linda","Goodwin, Paul"],"dc:date":"2012-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1555308,"sim:weight":0.283406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585490,"sim:weight":0.271043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.246649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.198677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59026,"sim:weight":0.198122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108738,"sim:weight":0.184288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.16297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In such circumstances, we are able to give upper and lower bounds on the arbitrage-free prices of the relevant options and show that these bounds are tight. Moreover, pathwise inequalities are derived, which provide the trading strategies with which we are able to realize any potential arbitrages. These super- and subhedging strategies have a simple quasi-static structure, their associated hedging error is bounded below, and in practice they carry low transaction costs. We show that, depending on the risk aversion of the investor, they can outperform significantly the standard delta/vega-hedging in presence of market frictions and/or model misspecification.

Intense positive lightning discharges can also cause sprites which occur either above or prior to the electron beam.

For example, Drosophila endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) mutants lose epithelial polarity and show increased cell proliferation, suggesting that ESCRT proteins could function as tumor suppressors. In this study, we show for the for the first time to our knowledge that ESCRT proteins are required to maintain polarity in mammalian epithelial cells. Inhibition of ESCRT function caused the tight junction protein claudin-1 to accumulate in intracellular vesicles. In contrast E-cadherin and occludin localization was unaffected. We investigated the cause of this accumulation and show that claudin-1 is constitutively recycled in kidney, colon, and lung epithelial cells, identifying claudin-1 recycling as a newly described feature of diverse epithelial cell types. This recycling requires ESCRT function, explaining the accumulation of intracellular claudin-1 when ESCRT function is inhibited. We further demonstrate that small interfering RNA knockdown of the ESCRT protein Tsg101 causes epithelial monolayers to lose their polarized organization and interferes with the establishment of a normal epithelial permeability barrier. ESCRT knockdown also reduces the formation of correctly polarized three-dimensional cysts. Thus, in mammalian epithelial cells, ESCRT function is required for claudin-1 trafficking and for epithelial cell polarity, supporting the hypothesis that ESCRT proteins function as tumor suppressors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dukes, Joseph D","Fish, Laura","Richardson, Judith D","Blaikley, Elizabeth","Burns, Samir","Caunt, Christopher J","Chalmers, Andrew D","Whitley, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1584827,"sim:weight":0.464582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.0967763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.0732963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0669038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.0645735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is responsible for the hydrolysis of estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate to estrone and dehydroepiandrosterone, respectively, both of which can be subsequently reduced to steroids with estrogenic properties (i.e. estradiol and androstenediol) that can stimulate the growth of tumors in hormone-responsive tissues of the breast, endometrium and prostate. Hence, the action of steroid sulfatase is implicated in physiological processes and pathological conditions. It has been five years since our group last reviewed the important role of this enzyme in steroid synthesis and the progress made in the development of potent inhibitors of this important enzyme target. This timely review therefore concentrates on recent advances in steroid sulfatase research, and summarises the findings of clinical trials with Irosustat (BN83495), the only steroid sulfatase inhibitor that is being trialed in postmenopausal women with breast or endometrial cancer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Purohit, A","Woo, Lok W L","Potter, Barry V L"],"dc:date":"2011-07-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The preference of these cations for non-centrosymmetric coordination environments has previously been rationalised in terms of direct hybridisation of metal s and p valence orbitals, thus lowering the internal electronic energy of the N-2 ion. This explanation in terms of an on-site second-order Jahn-Teller effect remains the contemporary textbook explanation. In this tutorial review, we review recent progress in this area, based on quantum chemical calculations and X-ray spectroscopic measurements. This recent work has led to a revised model, which highlights the important role of covalent interaction with oxygen in mediating lone pair formation for metal oxides. The role of the anion p atomic orbital in chemical bonding is key to explaining why chalcogenides display a weaker preference for structural distortions in comparison to oxides and halides. The underlying chemical interactions are responsible for the unique physicochemical properties of oxides containing lone pairs and, in particular, to their application as photocatalysts (BiVO(4)), ferroelectrics (PbTiO(3)), multi-ferroics (BiFeO(3)) and p-type semiconductors (SnO). The exploration of lone pair systems remains a viable a venue for the design of functional multi-component oxide compounds.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walsh, Aron","Payne,  D. J.","Egdell,  R.

We find that (i) the diverse range of crystal structures such as the monoclinic, cubic, and tetragonal phases can all be derived from the zinc-blende structure with tetrahedral coordination. (ii) The energy stability of different structures is determined primarily by the local cation coordination around anions, which can be explained by a generalized valence octet rule. Structures with only Cu(3)Sn and Cu(2)Sn(2) clusters around the anions have low and nearly degenerate energies, which makes Cu and Sn partially disordered in the cation sublattice. (iii) The direct band gaps of the low-energy compounds Cu(2)SnS(3) and Cu(2)SnSe(3) should be in the range of 0.8-0.9 and 0.4 eV, respectively, and are weakly dependent on the long-range structural order.

For example, dynamic heat sources arising from seals, bearings and other rubbing stator components may cause rotor thermal bend instability. In active magnetic bearing (AMB) systems, the rotor may experience forward and backward whirl rubs with touchdown bearings (TDBs). In abnormal cases, rotor transient and bounce interactions with such bearings may involve highly localized and short duration contacts. This paper discusses certain contact phenomena that may occur in passive and active systems. For example, the rub induced spiral behavior arises from a combination of unbalance and a thermal input that moves slowly around the rotor, typically in passive rotor-bearing systems. However, the instability can be regarded as if arising from a closed-loop feedback system. Hence it is possible to analyze the phenomenon using techniques that have been developed for active control systems. Rotors levitated by AMBs are truly active, but there are fundamental issues that may arise when contact with TDBs occurs. AMB control and contact interactions are discussed together with the benefits for making the TDB an active element. The reason for this lies in the potential ability to control the contact dynamics and associated mechanical and thermal stresses. A prototype system is described.","bibo:AuthorList":["Keogh, Patrick S."],"dc:date":"2012-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The impedance of the TinO2n-1 can be resolved into two different contributions, namely the grain bulk (RB) and grain boundaries (RGB). The ac conductivity increases with frequency and temperature, following a universal power law. The high relative permittivity (105-106), which is relatively frequency independent from 0.1Hz to 100kHz, is attributed to the presence of insulating grain boundaries (RGBRB) creating an Internal Barrier Layer Capacitor (IBLC) effect. Above 100kHz, the grain boundaries begin to contribute to the ac conductivity and the permittivity drops sharply.","bibo:AuthorList":["Regonini, Domenico","Dent, Andrew C.

The fairness that our algorithm provides matches that offered by the widely accepted Proportional Fair (PF) scheduler. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a sum rate that is almost equivalent (i.e. 90%) to the sum rate achieved by the PF scheduler, while only requiring minimal exchange of information between nodes.

In three studies, UK adults’ understanding and use of credit cost and duration information were investigated from a bounded rationality perspective. Study 1, part of a representative survey of UK adults (N \u003d1000), found that when presented with annual percentage rate (APR) participants significantly overestimated the total cost (TC) of a 12-month loan. In Study 2, loan duration and APR were varied in an independent groups experiment (N \u003d242). Bank customers’ TC estimates were sensitive to both loan duration and APR but TC was again substantially overestimated. Study 3 was an independent groups experiment investigating the effect of APR and TC information on credit decisions (N \u003d241). APR often influenced decisions between loans varying in duration and monthly repayment, but this effect was moderated by TC information. It was concluded that: (1) people generally misunderstand the relation between APR and TC; and (2) although APR information can have a large effect on credit decisions, its effect is either attenuated or amplified by TC information. The findings are interpreted in terms of a ‘take the best APR’ heuristic and a dual mental account model of instalment credit. Recommendations for improving credit information provision and financial education are offered.","bibo:AuthorList":["McHugh, Sandie","Ranyard, Rob","Lewis, Alan"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176865,"sim:weight":0.270059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108674,"sim:weight":0.208307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108169,"sim:weight":0.173205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108782,"sim:weight":0.164533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109134,"sim:weight":0.145646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108207,"sim:weight":0.14332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27310,"sim:weight":0.121405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316086,"sim:weight":0.121322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108688,"sim:weight":0.120458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108236,"sim:weight":0.11714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85823,"sim:weight":0.110014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109019,"sim:weight":0.0982476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85709,"sim:weight":0.0894061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The velocity of longitudinal acoustic waves in porous silicon layers electrochemically etched in (100), (110), and (111) oriented wafers has been measured by acoustic spectroscopy in the gigahertz frequency range. This non-destructive method was used for porous silicon layers with porosity of 25-85% obtaining velocities in the range of about 1 to 7 km s(-1). The implication of constant Poisson\u0027s ratio of porous silicon is examined. The effect of velocity dispersion due to multiple scattering is considered. The c(11) stiffness constant can be obtained from the velocity measurement in the [100] direction of a cubic crystal. We show that, using the results for velocity in [110] or [111] directions and Keating\u0027s relation, the stiffness constants c(12) and c(44) can be obtained. The velocity dependence on porosity was fitted as v\u003dv(0)(1 - phi)(kappa), where v(0) is the velocity in bulk silicon, phi is porosity, and kappa is a fitting parameter. It is shown that with other conditions being equal: (i) the porosity dependence of the acoustic velocity is related to the doping level of the wafer from which the porous silicon was etched (kappa depends on wafer resistivity); (ii) acoustic velocities in different crystallographic directions have the same dependence on porosity (kappa is independent of wafer orientation). This requires that all three stiffness constants c(11), c(12) and c(44) have the same dependence on porosity: cij \u003d c(ij)(0)(1 - phi)(m); and (iii) the morphology of porous layers depends on the HF concentration in the etchant (j is used as an indicator for the disorder of the porous structure).","bibo:AuthorList":["Aliev, Gazimagomed N.","Goller, Bernhard","Snow, Paul A."],"dc:date":"2011-08-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9611690,"sim:weight":0.43204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.293707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109133,"sim:weight":0.177522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.169646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26735,"sim:weight":0.155699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.150147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108050,"sim:weight":0.130977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108364,"sim:weight":0.122669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.111505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108676,"sim:weight":0.108544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108874,"sim:weight":0.104263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25054,"sim:weight":0.0953391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Independent prescribers are responsible for the initial assessment of patients with diagnosed and undiagnosed conditions. Public policy discourse and the views expressed by health care professionals have conceptualised diagnostic decision making as being at a \u0027higher level\u0027 and more difficult than prescribing decision making. This paper presents five themes related to this premise. Firstly diagnostic decision making is put into the broader context of clinical reasoning which underpins all types of clinical decisions including both diagnostic and prescribing decisions. Secondly, the nature of diagnostic decision making is discussed as to whether it is indeed separable from the prescribing decision making process. Thirdly, the conception that all diagnostic decisions are inherently more difficult is contested when difficulty in decision making is more appropriately applied to all types of clinical decisions which involve greater complexity and uncertainty. The fourth topic concerns whether this perception of diagnoses as being more difficult is a response by the medical profession to the threat of independent prescribing, reflecting their wish to maintain professional power and dominance over other professions. The final section considers how expertise in diagnoses could be developed in nurse and pharmacist independent prescribers. To develop their expertise in making accurate diagnoses, medicine uses the model of learning basic science mechanisms followed by engagement with patient clinical problems followed by years of clinical experience. However this may be just one way of achieving diagnostic expertise. Other approaches, such as the use of deliberate practice and feedback, may be more suitable to the diverse range of knowledge and experiences of nurse and pharmacist prescribers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Weiss, Marjorie C."],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.392923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1649312,"sim:weight":0.268855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.253266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.247484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.238667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108487,"sim:weight":0.237115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.204915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.204705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61005,"sim:weight":0.168354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this study was to examine the attitudes and beliefs of employees in the public sector about common health problems and work using the Flags system as a conceptual framework to identify problems and potential solutions. Method: 63 employees took part in 14 focus groups in two public sector organisations. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed thematically using NVivo. Results: The study confirmed the importance of heath-focused clinical factors (Yellow flags), perceptions of work (Blue flags), and more objective characteristics of work and organisational policies (Black flags), which emerged as major themes. The social and moral norms surrounding sickness absence and presenteeism were frequently discussed, including the impact of absence on colleagues, guilt, legitimising illness, and trust. There were interactions between the different Flags, often mediated by managers via their relationships with employees and their role in implementing organisational policy. Conclusions: The Flags system was useful as a conceptual framework in this context for identifying a number of obstacles to working with health problems, many of which were potentially modifiable on worker, workplace, or wider systems levels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buck, Rhiannon","Poretous, Carol","Wynne-Jones, Gwenllian","Marsh, Katie","Phillips, Ceri","Main, Chris"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":55959,"sim:weight":0.301997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5941,"sim:weight":0.250351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56397,"sim:weight":0.248247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.203393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.201118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.195881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108027,"sim:weight":0.191367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651882,"sim:weight":0.190015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The results of this study show that both alpha 7 and beta 2* nAChR can afford neuroprotection against OA-induced neurotoxicity. Protection mediated by alpha 7 nAChRs was independent of Ca(2+) and involved the intracellular signaling pathway Janus Kinase-2/Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt. When Ca(2+) entry was promoted through the alpha 7 nAChR by using the alpha 7-selective positive allosteric modulator PNU 120596, protection was lost. By contrast, protection mediated by beta 2* nAChRs was Ca(2+) dependent and implicated the signaling pathways PI3K/Akt and extracellular regulated kinase 1/2. Both alpha 7 and beta 2* nAChR activation converged on downregulation of GSK-3 beta and reduction of tau phosphorylation in cells undergoing cell death induced by OA. Therefore, targeting nAChR could offer a strategy for reducing neurodegeneration secondary to hyperphosphorylation of protein tau.","bibo:AuthorList":["del Barrio, L","Martin-de-Saavedra, M D","Romero, A","Parada, E","Egea, J","Avila, J","McIntosh, J M","Wonnacott, Susan","Lopez, M G"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5847048,"sim:weight":0.161327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26655,"sim:weight":0.115636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.096619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.0940976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87060,"sim:weight":0.0878367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

MWCO can be determined by performing a single run of pressure filtrations with a mixture of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) in aqueous solution using one of two PEG oligomer mixtures: PEG 200 to PEG 1000 for nanofiltration membranes or PEG 1000 to PEG 6000 for low MWCO ultrafiltration membranes. Analysis is via a repeatable and accurate reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method through a cheap chemical-bonded silica-based C8 column which finely resolves each of the PEG oligomers. Detection is via a low temperature evaporative light scanning detection (ELSD) method that resolves peaks to a molecular weight difference of just 44gmol-1 (corresponding to the CH2-O-CH2 structural unit difference between the oligomers), allowing the most precise ever one-filtration determination of MWCO. MWCO testing of commercially available membranes (from Koch, Filmtec and Hydranautics) confirmed the method gives MWCO in the expected range. Consequently, this new and refined method can effectively replace the previously required time consuming and costly multiple filtrations of individual PEG oligomers and other compounds for the determination of membrane MWCO for aqueous applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rohani, Rosiah","Hyland, Margaret","Patterson, Darrell"],"dc:date":"2011-10-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":699631,"sim:weight":0.135981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108317,"sim:weight":0.121932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23277,"sim:weight":0.0933456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.0926677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23056,"sim:weight":0.0840751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57332,"sim:weight":0.0779529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340647,"sim:weight":0.0665014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26546,"sim:weight":0.0645189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is further assumed that the foulant already on the surface acts as a seed, attracting more foulant in a micro-growth manner such that the growth rate is first order in with a rate constant k 1. Adopting the concept of removal mechanism similar to that used in adsorption science, the removal rate of the coverage is set to be proportional to the coverage with a rate constant of k 2. The three assumptions are combined to obtain the relationship d/dt \u003d k 1 (1 - ) - k 2 . The fouling layer grows on the covered surface and the fouling rate can be expressed as R f where R f can be any established fouling rate expression. Experimental data, including data obtained during induction periods have been successfully correlated for systems including crude oil fouling, water scaling and whey protein fouling. The physical meanings of the model parameters are discussed. The model supports experimental observations in which shorter induction periods are found with higher surface temperatures. The effects of the surface material and the flow velocity are also analysed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yang, Mengyan","Young, Andrew","Niyetkaliyev, Amir","Crittenden, Barry"],"dc:date":"2012-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109207,"sim:weight":0.214556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.185643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108488,"sim:weight":0.172021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29466,"sim:weight":0.167163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385581,"sim:weight":0.163911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.163647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108243,"sim:weight":0.1612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108096,"sim:weight":0.137648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.126641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.120486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The flow is bounded by horizontal top and bottom walls. The resulting equations are of mixed type: hyperbolic when the shear is weak and the behavior of the system is internal-wave like, and elliptic for strong shear. This ellipticity, or ill-posedness is shown to be a manifestation of large-scale shear instability. This paper gives sharp nonlinear stability conditions for this nonlinear system of equations. For initial data that are initially hyperbolic, two different types of evolution may occur: the system may remain hyperbolic up to internal wave breaking, or it may become elliptic prior to wave breaking. Using simple waves that give a priori bounds on the solutions, we are able to characterize the condition preventing the second behavior, thus providing a long-time well-posedness, or nonlinear stability result. Our formulation also provides a systematic way to pass to the Boussinesq limit, whereby the density differences affect buoyancy but not momentum, and to recover the result that shear instability cannot occur from hyperbolic initial data in that case.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boonkasame, Anakewit","Milewski, Paul"],"dc:date":"2012-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":708791,"sim:weight":0.328136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29436,"sim:weight":0.299598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":666427,"sim:weight":0.281115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5838568,"sim:weight":0.256834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23553,"sim:weight":0.235812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":666582,"sim:weight":0.220355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.196914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":675752,"sim:weight":0.196039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29453,"sim:weight":0.189038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2381185,"sim:weight":0.184482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27227,"sim:weight":0.134859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29461,"sim:weight":0.13107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We have previously shown that two-layer flows with Richardson number greater than one are nonlinearly stable, in the following sense: when the system is well-posed at a given time, it remains well-posed through the nonlinear evolution. Here, we give a general necessary condition for the nonlinear stability of systems of mixed type.

The closure maximizes the rate of mixing, treating the dynamical hydraulic equations and entropy conditions as constraints. This closure may also be viewed as yielding an upper bound on the mixing rate by internal shocks. It is shown that the maximal mixing rate is accomplished by a shock moving at the fastest allowable speed against the upstream flow. Depending on whether the active constraint limiting this speed is the Lax entropy condition or the positive dissipation of energy, we distinguish precisely between internal hydraulic jumps and bores. Maximizing entrainment is shown to be equivalent to maximizing a suitable entropy associated to mixing. By using the latter, one can describe the flow globally by an optimization procedure, without treating the shocks separately. A general mathematical framework is formulated that can be applied whenever an insufficient number of conservation laws is supplemented by a maximization principle.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jacobson, Tivon","Milewski, Paul A","Tabak, Esteban G."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2305498,"sim:weight":0.219244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23896,"sim:weight":0.192959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29453,"sim:weight":0.187903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269863,"sim:weight":0.186291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85525,"sim:weight":0.18627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30695,"sim:weight":0.177277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30664,"sim:weight":0.164184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29461,"sim:weight":0.153629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.148362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108372,"sim:weight":0.145536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At first glance, one expects this tendency to respond to the deep fascination that human beings have for centuries felt with storytelling and, therefore, to serve some motivational and humanistic purposes. However, this integration has been seen as serving merely linguistic purposes by most language educators, who regard literary texts simply as wonderful sources of input which expose students to a rich variety of language forms and uses as well as discourse types in motivating and meaningful\r\ncontexts. Additionally, work on fictional texts is\r\njustified as long as it facilitates the development of\r\nreading comprehension skills and critical thinking techniques for text analysis.\r\nThough these pedagogical goals are perfectly valid, the treatment of literary texts cannot be restricted to the attainment of language learning objectives. Foreign language teachers should not forget the educational implications of all the decisions they make in the classroom. Therefore, if they transmit the idea to learners that reading literary texts should be justified by some\r\ninstrumental motivation such as vocabulary learning or text analysis, they are validating current teaching practices at schools which disregard the aesthetic goals for reading literature and, instead, emphasise the achievement of more objective goals that have nothing to do with the true nature\r\nof literary reading. These teaching practices usually lead to the same unfortunate outcomes: the widespread dislike for literary reading, the failure to associate the reading of fiction with pleasure, and the subsequent lack of literary reading habits.\r\nThe purpose of the study reported in this article was, in broad terms, to explore the value of an alternative role of literary reading in foreign language classrooms. It specifically aimed at empowering students to develop a better appreciation of the literary experience and to read\r\nliterature with greater competence and pleasure by\r\nencouraging them to adopt a reader-based approach to fictional texts and a predominantly aesthetic stance during the reader-text transaction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sanchez, Hugo S"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research uses sociocultural perspectives to frame the connection among person and collective in terms of the emergence of collective agency. Teachers’ collective agency comprises collaborative action that transforms institutionally-defined artifacts into collectively-derived tools for teaching practice. Data include a detailed transcript of a 39-minute sequence pivotal to the enactment of reform principles by teaching staff in a US public secondary school. The analysis, which draws on views of language and semiotic mediation that complement sociocultural perspectives, traces one interactive move in the realignment of social relations in the collective that contributed to the uptake and transformation of an artifact introduced as part of the reform initiative. Findings of the study provide a dynamic view of the development of collective agency as specific alignments among person, collective, and institution in the enactment of reform. Implications for practice include highlighting conditions and patterns of interaction conducive to the mutual adaptation of institutionally-derived forms and collectively-mediated actions. The study contributes a novel approach to illuminating the institutional dynamics of educational change in the everyday interactions that constitute professional work in schools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Eddy Spicer, David H."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1584852,"sim:weight":0.261257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.212949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.208054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.177653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The system consists of a moulded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) grating adhesively bonded to square pultruded GFRP box sections as structural formwork for a concrete slab. Holes cut into the top flange of the box sections at a variable spacing allow concrete ‘studs’ to form at the grating/box section interface. During casting, GFRP dowels are inserted into the holes to further connect the grating and box sections. Following component tests on the concrete-filled grating and shear connectors, six (300 x 150) mm and 3000 mm long slab specimens were designed and tested under five-point bending. From the resulting load-deflection curves, it was determined that all specimens behaved elastically and fully compositely until the initial peak was reached. No slip was observed between the concrete and GFRP box sections until the longitudinal shear failure occurred at the initial peak. The load capacity carried on increasing at a reduced stiffness in a progressive manner, with significant residual strength and slip observed. All specimens failed by the separation of the webs and flange at the upper corners of the box sections due to the large curvature induced. Full-scale experimental results demonstrated that the controlled longitudinal shear failure provided deformability to the overall system and a robust interaction between the concrete and FRP formwork was achieved.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gai, Xian","Darby, Antony","Ibell, Timothy","Evernden, Mark"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Prior research in the area of scaffolding in primary school classrooms has focused on pupils operating in their native language and their interactions with the teacher and each other. The nature of scaffolding in the construction of knowledge has been identified and explored at an interactional level of talk. While these studies have informed educational practice in schools and teacher training contexts, there has been little research which puts the social, cultural and linguistic context at the heart of scaffolding. This thesis is based on a socio- cultural theory of learning and as such recognizes the influence of the context on the scaffolding of construction of teaching knowledge. This research was a qualitative study utilizing ethnographic techniques. Data emerged over time from recorded feedback sessions, recorded input sessions, self-evaluations, assignments, respondent validations and research diary. It became apparent early on in the study that scaffolding was taking place at both a micro-level, as manifested in the interaction between trainer and trainee, and at a macro-level, as manifested in the context of the training. The context of training included the second language context, the discourses of teaching and training, and the relationship between theory and practice. This study is significant in that it highlights the relationship between context and talk in scaffolding the construction of teaching knowledge. Hitherto, this relationship has not been emphasized in reports on scaffolding. The mutually beneficial relationship of macro and micro-scaffolding points to a teacher training pedagogy which acknowledges both macro-conditions for scaffolding, as well as micro-scaffolding techniques at an interactional level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Engin, Marion"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.252602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.238478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.210981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108693,"sim:weight":0.199054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.196175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.195401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.182734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the employed experimental setup, the wave regimes of spiral, unstructured and crisscross waves as well as smooth film could be observed at disc rotational speeds of 50-200 rpm and flow rates of 5-20 mL/s with a calculated average thickness of 160-450 μm. The glass discs were coated with anatase TiO2 by a sol-gel procedure followed by heat treatment at 500 ° C for 1 h. The reactor was irradiated by a low pressure mercury UV lamp producing an irradiance of 12-23 W/m2 on the disc surface. The reactant was saturated with oxygen and the effect of spinning speed, flow rate and the resulting wave regime on the degradation rate and kinetics of methylene blue and its reaction intermediates determined. Reactions followed pseudo-second-order kinetics, suggesting dimerisation and/or mass transfer limitations given that the two reactions with the highest conversion observed at 15 mL/s and 100 and 200 rpm, were pseudo-first-order. The spinning disc reactor was, however, not photon transfer limited. The wave regimes showed no impact on the reaction rate, since the flow was mainly laminar with no interfacial mass transfer of oxidant required.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boiarkina, Irina","Pedron, Simon","Patterson, Darrell A."],"dc:date":"2011-11-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In this study, a cell penetrating peptide, containing the core HIV-1 Tat 48-57 sequence, conjugated with a porphyrin photosensitiser has been shown to be effective for PCI. Herein we report an investigation of the photophysical and photobiological properties of a water soluble bioconjugate of the cationic Tat peptide with a hydrophobic tetraphenylporphyrin derivative. The cellular uptake and localisation of the amphiphilic bioconjugate was examined in the HN5 human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line. Efficient cellular uptake and localisation in endo/lysosomal vesicles was found using fluorescence detection, and light-induced, rupture of the vesicles resulting in a more diffuse intracellular fluorescence distribution was observed. Conjugation of the Tat sequence with a hydrophobic porphyrin thus enables cellular delivery of an amphiphilic photosensitiser which can then localise in endo/lysosomal membranes, as required for effective PCI treatment. PCI efficacy was tested in combination with a protein toxin, saporin, and a significant reduction in cell viability was measured versus saporin or photosensitiser treatment alone. This study demonstrates that the cell penetrating peptide-photosensitiser bioconjugation strategy is a promising and versatile approach for enhancing the therapeutic potential of bioactive agents through photochemical internalisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Julie T.-W.","Giuntini, Francesca","Eggleston, Ian M.","Bown, Stephen G.","MacRobert, Alexander J."],"dc:date":"2012-01-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Assuming rigid lid vertical boundary conditions, the conditions imposed at the surface and at the top of the troposphere were expanded in a Taylor series around two isobaric surfaces in an approach similar to that used in the theory of surface–gravity waves in deep water and capillary–gravity waves. By adopting the asymptotic method of multiple time scales, the equatorial Rossby, mixed Rossby–gravity, inertio-gravity, and Kelvin waves, as well as their vertical structures, were obtained as leading-order solutions. These waves were shown to interact resonantly in a triad configuration at the O(ε) approximation. The resonant triads whose wave components satisfy a resonance condition for their vertical structures were found to have the most significant interactions, although this condition is not excluding, unlike the resonant conditions for the zonal wavenumbers and meridional modes. Thus, the analysis has focused on such resonant triads. In general, it was found that for these resonant triads satisfying the resonance condition in the vertical direction, the wave with the highest absolute frequency always acts as an energy source (or sink) for the remaining triad components, as usually occurs in several other physical problems in fluid dynamics. In addition, the zonally symmetric geostrophic modes act as catalyst modes for the energy exchanges between two dispersive waves in a resonant triad. The integration of the reduced asymptotic equations for a single resonant triad shows that, for the initial mode amplitudes characterizing realistic magnitudes of atmospheric flow perturbations, the modes in general exchange energy on low-frequency (intraseasonal and/or even longer) time scales, with the interaction period being dependent upon the initial mode amplitudes. Potential future applications of the present theory to the real atmosphere with the inclusion of diabatic forcing, dissipation, and a more realistic background state are also discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Raupp, Carlos F.

That requires a subtle analysis of lax natural transformations between Poset-valued functors on a Lawvere theory, of locally ordered endofunctors and comonads on locally ordered categories, and of coalgebras, oplax maps of coalgebras, and the relationships between such for locally ordered endofunctors and the cofree comonads on them","bibo:AuthorList":["Komendantskaya, Ekaterina","Power, John"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930791,"sim:weight":0.453951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932125,"sim:weight":0.36723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931642,"sim:weight":0.351541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513401,"sim:weight":0.338615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85430,"sim:weight":0.186003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393453,"sim:weight":0.115126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1578933,"sim:weight":0.10862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A novel wingbox design and production process is used to illustrate this. The aerospace industry has not benefited from the significant reductions in production cost and cycle time that can result from greater assembly efficiency, part-to-part interchangeability and the use of flexible automation. This is largely due to the very high accuracies required across large scale assemblies. The use of metrology can reduce process steps, reduce the reliance on costly hard tooling, reduce the requirement for manually intensive and time consuming re-working at late stages of assembly, and allow low cost flexible automation to place tools to the required accuracies. The generic MADA process is presented together with guidelines for the design of structures to enable MADA.","bibo:AuthorList":["Muelaner, Jody E","Maropoulos, Paul G."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Initially tests were carried out to determine the angular uncertainties on an individual R-LAT transmitter-receiver pair. A method is presented of determining the uncertainty of dimensional measurement for a three dimensional coordinate measurement machine. An experimental procedure was developed to compare three dimensional coordinate measurements with calibrated reference points. The reference standard used to calibrate these reference points was a fringe counting interferometer with the multilateration technique employed to establish three dimensional coordinates. This is an extension of the established technique of comparing measured lengths with calibrated lengths. The method was found to be practical and able to establish that the expanded uncertainty of the basic iGPS system was approximately 1 mm at a 95% confidence level. Further tests carried out on a highly optimized version of the iGPS system have shown that the coordinate uncertainty can be reduced to 0.25 mm at a 95% confidence level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Muelaner, Jody E.","Wang, Zheng","Martin, Oliver","Jamshidi, Jafar","Maropoulos, Paul G."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2804976,"sim:weight":0.825689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53514,"sim:weight":0.301289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653331,"sim:weight":0.269685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57340,"sim:weight":0.250089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26528,"sim:weight":0.233606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54114,"sim:weight":0.22412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58909,"sim:weight":0.196644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.191208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59004,"sim:weight":0.184225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84861,"sim:weight":0.178289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56595,"sim:weight":0.168727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.136575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We consider this model in a setting which is continuous in time and discrete in space, and focus on time-constant, independent and identically distributed potentials with polynomial tails at infinity.

Our main result is that the periods, in which the profile of the solutions remains nearly constant, are increasing linearly over time, a phenomenon known as ageing. We describe this phenomenon in the weak sense, by looking at the asymptotic probability of a change in a given time window, and in the strong sense, by identifying the almost sure upper envelope for the process of the time remaining until the next change of profile. We also prove functional scaling limit theorems for profile and growth rate of the solution of the parabolic Anderson model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morters, Peter","Ortgiese, Marcel","Sidorova, Nadia"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As a measure of school quality, we look at the\r\nperformance of pupils at the nationwide standard test (the so-called Cito test) in the final year of\r\nprimary education. Since competition is likely to be endogenous to the quality of schools, we\r\nuse the distance between the school and the town centre as an instrument for the level of\r\ncompetition faced by a school. The intuition is that schools located close to the town centre,\r\nwhich are easily accessible to a large number of parents, face more competition than schools\r\nlocated further away from the town centre. Using a large range of data on pupil, school and\r\nmarket characteristics, we find that school competition has a small positive significant effect on\r\npupil achievement. An increase in competition by one standard deviation (comparable to 5\r\nadditional schools in the market) increases pupil achievement at the Cito test by five to ten\r\npercent of the mean standard deviation, so about less than one point.

Using ordinary least squares (OLS) and twin fixed\r\neffects (FE) estimation approaches, we find that early (pre-18) conduct disorder problems\r\nsignificantly affect both human capital accumulation and violent and criminal behaviour over\r\nthe life course. For instance, within pairs of identical twins we find that conduct disorder\r\nreduces the probability of high school graduation with 4 to 13 percent points and increases the\r\nprobability of being arrested with 7 to 16 percent points.

This principle of proper mass spans sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities and has been observed in a wide variety of vertebrate species. Yet, it is unknown if this concept extrapolates to entire neural pathways or how selection on a behavioral capacity might otherwise shape circuit structure. We investigate these questions by comparing the songs and neuroanatomy of 49 species from 17 families of songbirds, which vary immensely in the number of unique song components they produce and possess a conserved neural network dedicated to this behavior. We find that syllable repertoire size is strongly related to the degree of song motor pathway convergence. Repertoire size is more accurately predicted by the number of neurons in higher motor areas relative to that in their downstream targets than by the overall number of neurons in the song motor pathway. Additionally, the convergence values along serial premotor and primary motor projections account for distinct portions of the behavioral variation. These findings suggest that selection on song has independently shaped different components of this hierarchical pathway, and they elucidate how changes in pathway structure could have underlain elaborations of this learned motor behavior.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, J M","Szekely, Tamas","Buki, J","DeVoogd, T J"],"dc:date":"2011-09-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8929444,"sim:weight":0.209403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86113,"sim:weight":0.187565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.184007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87204,"sim:weight":0.174728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.167924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.160678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999700,"sim:weight":0.154086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69994,"sim:weight":0.140542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One hundred and sixteen children aged 8-14 years with SpLD, and 312 same age typically developing children with their parents (one or both), respectively, completed the child and parent versions of the KINDL(R) questionnaire. Values were analyzed with ANOVA and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Significant mean differences were found between children with SpLD and their mother\u0027s proxy ratings. So, mothers reported significantly lower scores in the dimension of everyday functioning in school, but significantly higher scores regarding the child\u0027s physical and emotional well-being. For typically developing children, significant differences between children and parents\u0027 proxy ratings were found in physical well-being and self-esteem with both parents reporting higher scores. Concerning ICC, correlations were few and low in the SpLD group but more robust in the typically developing child-parent proxy ratings with values ranging from 0.22 to 0.46. In the case of SpLD, the child\u0027s problem area, which is reflected in the KINDL(R) dimension of everyday functioning in school, seems to be an issue of controversial value that may be differentially perceived by children and their mothers. Further, it can be argued that as mothers seemed to perceive in a more negative way the child\u0027s QoL at school, they were at the same time attempting to counterbalance their reactions by overestimating the child\u0027s physical and emotional well-being. Besides differences, there is a tendency even low for mothers and children with SpLD to converge toward similar perceptions regarding the child\u0027s physical and emotional well-being and satisfaction with friends that is showing some rather common understanding of the child\u0027s overall well-being and his/her relationships with peers. In the control group, agreement between children and parents seems to be more even and evident.

Following a comparison with existing methods in a simulated environment, dimension expansion is studied on a classic test-bed data set historically used to study nonstationary models. Following this, we explore the use of dimension expansion in modeling air pollution in the United Kingdom, a process known to be strongly influenced by rural/urban effects, amongst others, which gives rise to a nonstationary field.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bornn, Luke","Shaddick, Gavin","Zidek, James V"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58797,"sim:weight":0.161524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67390,"sim:weight":0.130322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.11883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The investigation uses a single-sector case study methodology to explore the scope of supply strategy content, the interaction between supply strategy content and context, and supply strategy process within four aerospace sector companies. The research also uses an extant Integrative Framework to subsequently identify the ‘modes’ of supply strategy process that best describe supply strategy process in the case studies. While the scope of supply strategy content suggested by the supply management literature is theoretically broad, supply strategy process is represented in the literature as chiefly derived from business / corporate strategy. Recognising that details of the processes / practices that create supply strategy and the scope of content within supply strategies have been under-explored empirically, this investigation seeks to contribute to a developing understanding of supply strategy content and process ‘in practice’ and in particular, the role of actors in supply strategy process - which is largely absent in related studies. The research contributes to existing knowledge by finding that the opportunity / autonomy actors have to enact supply strategy process is broadly determined by contextual factors. Furthermore, the investigation finds that supply strategy process, actors and context all have a moderating effect on the scope of supply strategy content. It is also shown that different actors engage in the formulation and implementation stages of strategy process. Finally, the investigation identifies one dominant ‘mode’ of supply strategy process and distinctive combinations of ‘secondary’ modes in each case study. For practitioners, this investigation illustrates that the opportunity and facility to think / act strategically in supply is dependant upon more than just resolve and motivation; it is the product of a complex interaction of strategy context, content, process and actors.

The model equation supports line solitary waves which are spatially localized in the direction of propagation and constant in the transverse direction, and lump solitary waves which are spatially localized in both directions. Branches of both line and lump solitary waves are computed via a numerical continuation method. The stability of each type of wave is examined. The transverse instability of line solitary waves is predicted by a similar instability of line solitary waves in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The spectral stability of lumps is predicted using the waves\u0027 speed energy relation. The role of wave collapse in the stability of these waves is also examined. Numerical time evolution is used to confirm stability predictions and observe dynamics, including instabilities and solitary wave collisions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Akers, Benjamin","Milewski, Paul A"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This article contributes to organizational culture change theory in education by conceptualizing different perspectives on organizational culture—external reality, interpretation, organization, competing subcultures, and process. It then analyzes aspects of an 8-year culture change process in a school staff group using the different perspectives to illustrate their utility. In the paper, we describe the methodology, outline the case study, explain each perspective, and explore the culture change process from that perspective.

We use a nonlinear elastic model that has been used to describe the dynamics of ice sheets. Particular attention is paid to forced and unforced dynamics of waves having near-minimum phase speed. For the unforced problem, we find that wavepacket solitary waves bifurcate from nonlinear periodic waves of minimum speed. When the problem is forced by a moving load, we find that, for small-amplitude forcing, steady responses are possible at all subcritical speeds, but for larger loads there is a transcritical range of forcing speeds for which there are no steady solutions. In unsteady computations, we find that if the problem is forced at a speed in this range, very large unsteady responses are obtained, and that when the forcing is released, a solitary wave is generated. These solitary waves appear stable, and can coexist within a sea of small-amplitude waves.","bibo:AuthorList":["Milewski, Paul A","Vanden-Broeck, J -M","Wang, Zhan"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In general this requires the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem for an unsymmetric integro-differential operator in six independent variables, modeling transport, scattering, and fission, where the dependent variable is the neutron angular flux. In engineering practice this problem is often solved iteratively, using some variant of the inverse power method. Because of the high dimension, matrix representations for the operators are often not available and the inner solves needed for the eigenvalue iteration are implemented by matrix-free inner iterations. This leads to technically complicated inexact iterative methods, for which there appears to be no published rigorous convergence theory. For the monoenergetic homogeneous model case with isotropic scattering and vacuum boundary conditions, we show that, before discretization, the general nonsymmetric eigenproblem for the angular flux is equivalent to a certain related eigenproblem for the scalar flux, involving a symmetric positive definite weakly singular integral operator (in space only). This correspondence to a symmetric problem (in a space of reduced dimension) permits us to give a convergence theory for inexact inverse iteration and related methods. In particular this theory provides rather precise criteria on how accurate the inner solves need to be in order for the whole iterative method to converge. We also give examples of discretizations which have a corresponding symmetric finite-dimensional reduced form. The theory is illustrated with numerical examples for several test problems of physical relevance, using GMRES as the inner solver.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scheben, Fynn","Graham, Ivan G"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1573416,"sim:weight":0.458837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573383,"sim:weight":0.421892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573385,"sim:weight":0.420825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573384,"sim:weight":0.395495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573377,"sim:weight":0.370449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316487,"sim:weight":0.245043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.229976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85525,"sim:weight":0.22013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.177755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26023,"sim:weight":0.159992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Three forest harvesting residues were examined (whole tree thinnings, roundwood and brash bales), and each have their own energy and emission profile. The whole forest rotation was examined, including original site establishment, forest road construction, biomass harvesting during thinning and final clear-fell events, chipping and transportation. Generally, higher yielding sites give lower GHG emissions per ‘oven dried tonne’ (ODT) forest residues, but GHG emissions ‘per hectare’ are higher as more biomass is extracted. Greater quantities of biomass, however, ultimately mean greater displacement of conventional fuels and therefore greater potential for GHG emission mitigation. Although forest road construction and site establishment are “one off” events they are highly energy-intensive operations associated with high diesel fuel consumption, when placed in context with the full forest rotation, however, their relative contributions to the overall energy requirements and GHG emissions are small. The lower bulk density of wood chips means that transportation energy requirements and GHG emissions are higher compared with roundwood logs and brash bales, suggesting that chipping should occur near the end-user of application.","bibo:AuthorList":["Whittaker, Carly","Mortimer, Nigel","Murphy, Richard","Matthews, Robert"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999568,"sim:weight":0.380799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53435,"sim:weight":0.348605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386065,"sim:weight":0.225432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5843844,"sim:weight":0.213818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.15757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821124,"sim:weight":0.144493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.121337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.121337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It has long been thought to act by disrupting a thalamic focus via blockade of T-type channels and, thus, generation of spike–wave activity in thalamocortical pathways. However, there is now good evidence that generalized absence seizures may be initiated at a cortical focus and that ethosuximide may target this focus. In the present study we have looked at the effect ethosuximide on glutamate and GABA release at synapses in the rat entorhinal cortex in vitro, using two experimental approaches. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies revealed an increase in spontaneous GABA release by ethosuximide concurrent with no change in glutamate release. This was reflected in studies that estimated global background inhibition and excitation from intracellularly recorded membrane potential fluctuations, where there was a substantial rise in the ratio of network inhibition to excitation, and a concurrent decrease in excitability of neurones embedded in this network. These studies suggest that, in addition to well-characterised effects on ion channels, ethosuximide may directly elevate synaptic inhibition in the cortex and that this could contribute to its anti-absence effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greenhill, Stuart D","Morgan, Nicola H.","Massey, Peter V","Woodhall, Gavin L.","Jones, Roland S G"],"dc:date":"2012-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1573435,"sim:weight":0.399375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584828,"sim:weight":0.320151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573434,"sim:weight":0.262062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573437,"sim:weight":0.217961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268784,"sim:weight":0.172507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80232,"sim:weight":0.159081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.150635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two-folds are generic in piecewise smooth systems of three or more dimensions. We derive the local dynamics of all possible two-folds in three dimensions, including nonlinear effects around certain bifurcations, finding that they admit a flow exhibiting chaotic but nondeterministic dynamics. In cases where the flow passes through the two-fold, upon reaching the singularity it is unique in neither forward nor backward time, meaning the causal link between inward and outward dynamics is severed. In one scenario this occurs recurrently. The resulting flow makes repeated, but nonperiodic, excursions from the singularity, whose path and amplitude is not determined by previous excursions. We show that this behavior is robust and has many of the properties associated with chaos. Local geometry reveals that the chaotic behavior can be eliminated by varying a single parameter: the angular jump of the vector field across the two-fold.","bibo:AuthorList":["Colombo, Alessandro","Jeffrey, Mike R"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26329,"sim:weight":0.217314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332856,"sim:weight":0.198632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268818,"sim:weight":0.180596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85026,"sim:weight":0.172117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2309348,"sim:weight":0.143477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Such systems are characterized by discontinuous jumps in the right-hand sides of differential equations across a phase space boundary and are often used as physical models of stick-slip motion and relay control. Sliding bifurcations of periodic orbits have recently been shown to underlie the onset of complex dynamics including chaos. In contrast to previously analyzed cases, in this work a periodic orbit is assumed to graze the boundary of a repelling sliding region, resulting in its abrupt destruction without any precursive change in its stability or period. Necessary conditions for the occurrence of such catastrophic grazing-sliding bifurcations are derived. The analysis is illustrated in a piecewise-smooth model of a stripline resonator, where it can account for the abrupt onset of self-modulating current fluctuations. The resonator device is based around a ring of NbN containing a microbridge bottleneck, whose switching between normal and super conducting states can be modeled as discontinuous, and whose fast temperature versus slow current fluctuations are modeled by a slow-fast timescale separation in the dynamics. By approximating the slow component as Filippov sliding, explicit conditions are derived for catastrophic grazing-sliding bifurcations, which can be traced out as parameters vary. The results are shown to agree well with simulations of the slow-fast model and to offer a simple explanation of one of the key features of this experimental device.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jeffrey, Mike R","Champneys, A.

The imposition of a small behavioral cost (a single mouse point-and-click operation) on the switch between instructions and device encouraged more chunking and better subsequent test performance.

It is known that by measuring nonlinear parameters, the relative accumulated fatigue damage can be evaluated. However, there is still a need to measure two crack propagation states to assess the absolute residual fatigue life. A procedure based on the measurement of a third-order acoustic nonlinear parameter is presented to assess the residual fatigue life of a metallic component without the need of a baseline. The analytical evaluation of how the cubic nonlinear-parameter evolves during crack propagation is presented by combining the Paris law to the Nazarov-Sutin crack equation. Unlike other developed models, the proposed model assumes a crack surface topology with variable geometrical parameters. Measurements of the cubic nonlinearity parameter on AA2024-T351 specimens demonstrated high sensitivity to crack propagation and excellent agreement with the predicted theoretical behavior. The advantages of using the cubic nonlinearity parameter for fatigue cracks on metals are discussed by comparing the relevant results of a quadratic nonlinear parameter.

Despite\r\na lack of overall purity, samples containing IEPs from Thermosinus\r\ncarboxydivorans and Petrotoga mobilis were shown to have RT activity but\r\ncharacterisation of these IEPs was not carried out. However, an IEP from\r\nBacillus caldovelox proved to be an excellent candidate for characterisation as\r\nsuccessful purification was achieved. Enzyme engineering was also performed,\r\nfusing a Sac7d domain onto the C-terminus of this protein. These enzymes\r\nwere shown to have optimum RT activity at 54ºC with activity still being\r\ndisplayed at 76ºC. Other studies on these enzymes showed that, unlike the\r\nretroviral RTs, the IEPs displayed no DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity.\r\nThe Sac7d fusion protein was also studied in terms of possible enhancements\r\nto the RT activity of an IEP. However, preliminary studies showed that,\r\nalthough this domain did not prove to be detrimental to the enzyme, it had little\r\neffect on improving the processivity of the RTs.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\nAlthough this class of RT looks promising in terms of use as an alternative\r\nthermophilic RT, the IEPs studied in this report did incur major limitations during\r\ncDNA synthesis, which included lower than expected optimum reaction\r\ntemperatures, very low fidelity and an inability to synthesise cDNA using\r\ncomplex RNA templates.","bibo:AuthorList":["Voina, Natasha J"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84807,"sim:weight":0.197246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.183254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85935,"sim:weight":0.177855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929813,"sim:weight":0.177465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.167347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.162204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25913,"sim:weight":0.153991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.137561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.124218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22887,"sim:weight":0.123553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Sugars represent a major source of carbon supporting heterotrophic growth in Archaea and are oxidized via a conserved set of central metabolic pathways, including modified versions of the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nSulfolobus solfataricus is a hyperthermophilic archaeon from the kingdom crenarchaeota. It is a strict aerobe that grows optimally at 80-85C, pH 2-4, and utilises numerous carbon sources including the four most-commonly occurring sugars in nature, D-glucose, D-galactose, D-xylose and L-arabinose. In S. solfataricus, glucose and galactose are metabolised through the non-phosphorylative ED pathway in which a single set of enzymes are utilised for the catabolism of both sugars, leading to the proposal of a metabolically promiscuous pathway. The first section of this pathway includes three enzymes, glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), gluconate dehydratase (GD) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconate (KDG) aldolase, two of which, GDH and KDG aldolase, are found to have activity with pentose as well as hexose sugars, although the third enzyme, GD, is hexose specific. KDG-aldolase cleaves hexose substrates into pyruvate and glyceraldehyde, and pentoses into pyruvate and the C-2 compound glycoaldehyde. Glyceraldehyde is converted into a second molecule of pyruvate, but the fate of glycoaldehyde is currently unknown.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nIn this thesis, the complete pathway for D-xylose and L-arabinose catabolism is elucidated. Through the detection of enzyme activities in the native organism and subsequent characterisation of recombinantly produced enzymes, the results presented show that a separate C5 dehydratase exists, completing the first part of a non-phosphorylative C5 pathway, and that the subsequent enzymes required for glycolaldehyde metabolism (glycolaldehyde oxidoreductase, glycolate oxidase and malate synthase) are present and active during growth on C5 sugars.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nIn addition to the metabolic investigations, rational design and site-directed mutagenesis were used to explore the structural basis of substrate promiscuity of glucose dehydrogenase; in doing so, the enzyme was successfully engineered to oxidise the sugar D-ribose while retaining its activity with its natural substrates. These same techniques have been used to explore the relationship between structure, stability and catalytic activity of the S. solfataricus malate synthase, and the data have been fitted to a quantitative kinetic model that explores how temperature influences the activity of an enzyme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nunn, Charlotte E M"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26920,"sim:weight":0.198979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26544,"sim:weight":0.133601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109192,"sim:weight":0.130716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26064,"sim:weight":0.112107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.110757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However content which is created by librarians and information professionals need not be affected by issues such as publisher agreements, business models for peer-reviewing, etc. There is therefore an opportunity for those involved in the provision of library services to be pro-active in allowing content developed within the organisation to be made freely available for reuse by others. Training and user support materials provide one area in which a willingness to share resources should provide benefits to those working in the public sector in particular, in light of the significant reductions in funding we are currently seeing. In addition to conventional text-based resources the widespread availability of mobile devices and the growing ubiquity of WiFi networks are making it possible to share access to live events or to record such events and make recordings freely available to others. This paper provides a summary of recent experiences in the provision of amplified events in order to maximise access to events and the ideas discussed at events. We are now starting to see such events move beyond experimentation by early adopters and the provision of an event amplification infrastructure becoming increasingly by professionals who are seeking ways of developing their professional skills beyond traditional physical attendance at events.

Whether transcripts containing cancer-specific AS events are likely to be translated into functional proteins or simply reflect noisy splicing, thereby determining their clinical relevance, is not known. Here we show that consistent with a noisy-splicing model, cancer-specific AS events generally tend to be rare, containing more premature stop codons and have less identifiable functional domains in both the human and mouse. Interestingly, common cancer-derived AS transcripts from tumour suppressor and oncogenes show marked changes in premature stop-codon frequency; with tumour suppressor genes exhibiting increased levels of premature stop codons whereas oncogenes have the opposite pattern. We conclude that tumours tend to have faithful oncogene splicing and a higher incidence of premature stop codons among tumour suppressor and cancer-specific splice variants showing the importance of considering splicing noise when analysing cancer-specific splicing changes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen, L.","Tovar-Corona, J.

Diffusion times in water are long, even over comparatively short distances (millimetres). Therefore, transport from the external environment to the olfactory epithelium must be controlled by processes that rely on convection (i.e. the bulk flow of fluid). These include the beating of cilia lining the olfactory chamber and the relatively inexpensive pumping action of accessory sacs. Flow through the chamber may also be induced by an external flow. Flow over the olfactory epithelium appears to be laminar. Odorant transfer to the olfactory epithelium may be facilitated in several ways: if the olfactory organs are mounted on stalks that penetrate the boundary layer; by the steep velocity gradients generated by beating cilia; by devices that deflect flow into the olfactory chamber; by parallel arrays of olfactory lamellae; by mechanical agitation of the chamber (or olfactory stalks); and by vortices.

Researchers work with Research Support Offices in both Universities and the NHS. The 2006 government health research strategy, Best Research for Best Health heralded dramatic changes for both the funding of, and support for, clinical and applied health research in England with the creation of new, quality driven, competitive funding streams and a new infrastructure to support research and researchers. One of the results of these changes was to drive NHS and University Research Support Offices closer together, with some institutions forming close partnerships, including joint offices to deliver support for clinical and applied health research. Little is known about the models of partnership working between the universities and the NHS and the factors that drove the decisions to create partnership Research Support Offices. Therefore it is important to map current arrangements and describe the factors that contribute to those arrangements. Firstly a survey of University Research Support Offices based in universities with a medical school was undertaken to provide a snapshot of the structures and functions of those Research Support Offices. Then semistructured interviews were undertaken with a sample of staff working in joint NHS/University and separate NHS and University Research Support Offices to gain a deeper understanding of why the Research Support Offices were structured and functioned in the ways that they did. The main findings from this work were: there are no common structures, functions, or systems and few common processes in place to support clinical and applied health researchers across England; advice and help for navigating the complex regulatory environment currently underpinning clinical and applied health research in England is fragmented; three models of working between NHS and university Research Support Offices were identified; joint offices, collaborative offices and separate offices. The drivers for joint working between NHS and University Research Support Offices are compelling. However, the barriers to working closely can be immense if not carefully considered. Those contemplating working in partnership need to ensure that they understand what the partnership aims to deliver and all partners need to commit to a shared vision. In addition, practical issues such as the systems to be used, the physical location of staff and employment issues need to be addressed in advance before meaningful joint working can occur.","bibo:AuthorList":["Perkins, Mary J"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

After nominally zero field cooling in the Earth\u0027s field we find that the vortices appear to be in a stable glassy state in our highly disordered samples. After applying a cancellation field of a few Oersted at low temperature, however, the system enters a new regime at very low magnetic induction when the only image contrast is due to vortices that are intermittently trapped on strong pinning centres. This state shares many of the signatures of the re-entrant vortex liquid phase that has been theoretically predicted in these highly anisotropic materials at very low vortex densities. Analysing the trapping times for vortices in the fluctuating state we estimate that the pinning potential of typical strong pinning centres is about 900K under our experimental conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first direct experimental evidence for the existence of a dynamic liquid-like vortex state in this highly anisotropic material at very low magnetic induction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Crisan,  A.","Bending, Simon J.","Li,  Z.

The SDA features a cooled, removable heat transfer surface with well defined heat and mass transfer characteristics. Measurements of heat flux were combined with computational fluid dynamics simulations to yield reliable estimates of the surface temperature and shear stress. Fouling studies were performed with model solutions of 5 wt.% tripalmitin in a paraffin oil operating in the \u0027cold start\u0027 mode, wherein the experiment starts with the surface colder than the steady state, simulating one mode of operating a standard \u0027cold finger\u0027 experiment. Local heat flux measurements allowed the thermal fouling resistance to be monitored: deposit mass coverage and composition were also measured. The cold surface promotes the rapid formation of an initial gel layer, followed by a period of linear fouling, and finally falling rate fouling behaviour. The linear fouling rate was relatively insensitive to temperature and shear rate, while the fouling rate in the falling rate regime was found to depend on the temperature driving force for crystallisation kinetics. The solids fraction within the deposit layer increased over the duration of a 12 h fouling test, indicating rapid ageing. The rheological properties of the deposits were highly sensitive to solids fraction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Huang, Jen Yi","Chew, Y M John","Wilson, I D"],"dc:date":"2012-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85528,"sim:weight":0.239345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85046,"sim:weight":0.215174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.189061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108096,"sim:weight":0.173934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29461,"sim:weight":0.170247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24739,"sim:weight":0.163867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.140232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27099,"sim:weight":0.138893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is particularly so in the Antarctic. Measurements of summertime and wintertime polar 2-day waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region were made using identical meteor radars at the conjugate geographical latitudes of Rothera (68!S, 68!W) in the Antarctic and Esrange (68!N, 21!E) in Arctic Sweden. This allows accurate quantification of the differences in the nature and seasonal variability of the 2day\r\nwave between the two polar regions. A clear seasonal variability is evident with the maximum amplitudes occurring during the summer months in both hemispheres. However, significant differences are found in the behaviour of the summertime wave between the two polar regions. In particular, wave activity is shorter lived but of larger amplitude in the Antarctic. These differences are suggested to be partly due to the different background winds of the two polar regions and possible differences in the component zonal wavenumbers in the northern and southern hemispheres.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThese radar studies have excellent spatial, height and time resolution but cannot resolve the component zonal wavenumbers of the 2-day wave. Therefore, Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) measurements of atmospheric temperature were used to investigate the climatology and interhemispheric differences of the different zonal wavenumbers (westward propagating zonal wavenumbers 2, 3 and 4) that compose the 2-day wave “complex”. This study demonstrates that the wave is dominated by different\r\nwavenumbers in the northern and southern hemisphere and that some of the interhemispheric\r\ndifferences observed in ground-based studies can be explained by the seasonal variability of these different zonal wavenumbers.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThese satellite studies led to participation in a multi-technique international collaboration to study the short-term variability of the summertime 2-day wave.

Such devices are an exciting and relatively new form of photovoltaic (PV) technology, which can help bring solar power to the mass market using low energy processing methods, and materials that are cheap, and have several novel characteristics, such as being lightweight, flexible, and potentially even translucent. The modelling technique and many of the results found here are also applicable to other organic devices, such as organic light-emitting displays (OLEDs), as the underlying device physics is very similar.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing an introduction and discussions on the theoretical basis of the work and its computational implementation, the work described in the thesis falls into three main sections:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, an evaluation is performed as to the accuracy of the First Reaction Method (FRM), a means of reducing the computational complexity of KMC simulations. Although\r\nthis method is widely used, its accuracy when used to model OPV devices has never been satisfactorily evaluated, leading it to be questioned by some authors. Hence, its accuracy under a range of scenarios relevant for OPV simulations was tested and quantified. The findings presented here confirm its validity within the field and disorder ranges that are applicable to OPV device operation, and also give some insight into low-field geminate separation dynamics.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, the KMC methodology, with the FRM approximation, is applied to the investigation\r\nof the role of device morphology in determining OPV efficiency. Morphology optimisation has frequently been identified as being key to future device design, and the KMC methodology is unique in its ability to examine this. Furthermore, as the popularity\r\nof using self-assembled bicontinuous nanostructures in OPVs grows, it is useful to evaluate their potential impact on OPV efficiency, using the insight gained from investigating\r\nmorphology in general. Among the main conclusions reached from this work, it was determined that one of the key limiting factors in the efficiency of devices is the\r\nangle of the heterojunctions to the field, which is a feature of the device morphology. It was also found that, because of this, bicontinuous structures are unlikely to greatly improve OPV efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThirdly, modelling was performed in an attempt to reproduce the quantitative experimental\r\ncharacteristics of PFB:F8BT devices. This was achieved through first modelling individual charge mobility in the two polymers in question, and quantifying the effects of different forms of disorder. Having found disorder descriptions that could reproduce the single carrier mobility of both PFB and F8BT, as deduced by Blakesley et. al. using drift-diffusion modelling, this disorder description was applied to single layer devices, in order to deduce the injection barrier. Finally, the disorder and injection barriers deduced\r\nwere combined with optical modelling to reproduce full photovoltaic behaviour. This was generally found to be successful, and therefore potentially gives some real insight\r\ninto the nature of polymer disorder, whilst also validating the KMC model used in this thesis. An additional implication of this work is that the KMC model can, in the future, be applied to experimental data which cannot be satisfactorily modelled using drift-diffusion simulations.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Kimber, Robin"],"dc:date":"2011-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A method to locate reflecting objects using a form of spectral analysis is described.","bibo:AuthorList":["Benton, Christopher","Mitchell, Cathryn N"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44627,"sim:weight":0.302397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930023,"sim:weight":0.293251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710880,"sim:weight":0.276414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23406,"sim:weight":0.212687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28767,"sim:weight":0.204041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":712145,"sim:weight":0.168086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69556,"sim:weight":0.163631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26528,"sim:weight":0.140337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71069,"sim:weight":0.137946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71065,"sim:weight":0.131459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26814,"sim:weight":0.130938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To gain novel insight, 10 healthy men ingested carbohydrate with (C+P) and without (C) protein in a randomized order and double-blind manner during 2 hr of interval cycling followed by resistance-type exercise and into early postexercise recovery. Blood samples were obtained hourly throughout 9 hr of postexercise overnight recovery for analysis of key hormones. Muscle samples were taken from the vastus lateralis before and after exercise and then again the next morning (7 a. m.) to calculate mixed-muscle protein fractional synthetic rate (FSR). Overnight plasma hormone concentrations were converted into overall responses (expressed as area under the concentration curve) and did not differ between treatments for either growth hormone (1,464 +/- 257 vs. 1,432 +/- 164 pg/ml.540 min) or total testosterone (18.3 +/- 1.2 vs. 17.9 +/- 1.2 nmol/L . 540 min, C and C+P, respectively). In contrast, the overnight cortisol response was higher with C+P (102 +/- 11 nmol/L . 540 min) than with C (81 +/- 8 nmol/L . 540 min; p \u003d .02). Mixed-muscle FSR did not differ between C and C+P during overnight recovery (0.062% +/- 0.006% and 0.062% +/- 0.009%/hr, respectively) and correlated significantly with the plasma total testosterone response (r \u003d.7, p \u003c .01). No correlations with FSR were apparent for the response of growth hormone (r \u003d -.2, p \u003d .4), cortisol (r \u003d .1, p \u003d .6), or the ratio of testosterone to cortisol (r \u003d .2, p \u003d .5). In conclusion, protein ingestion during and shortly after exercise does not modulate the endocrine response or muscle protein synthesis during overnight recovery.","bibo:AuthorList":["Betts, James A.","Beelen,  M.","Stokes, Keith A.","Saris,  W.

A rim seal is fitted at the periphery and a superposed sealant flow is used to prevent ingress. The aim of this PhD research was to design a new rotor-stator testing facility, from which both flow physics and future heat transfer characteristics in relation to ingress could be measured and analysed, along with a detailed investigation into the sealing characteristics of turbine rim-seals there from. The rig was constructed as an engine representative model of a gas turbine wheel-space, from which data correlations could tentatively be scaled and applied to actual engine design. The novel testing facility was designed in great detail for both sealing effectiveness research and to investigate the thermal effects of hot gas ingress; insight never previously achieved. An extensive commissioning process was undertaken to ensure that the correct, albeit benign, fluid-dynamic conditions were created inside the single stage turbine rig. Effectiveness data are presented for single-clearance rim-seals in a variety of ingress conditions from which a fundamental understanding is developed for both rotationally-induced and externally-induced ingress. A newly developed orifice model is validated against the experimental data, resulting in theoretical predictions of the sealing effectiveness characteristics of various rim-seals. It is suggested that these predictions could be scaled to engine representative conditions where they could act as a future design tool for secondary air system engineers. The theory is then extended to the application of double clearance-seal configurations, whereby the beneficial aspects are shown both theoretically and experimentally, leading on to the suggestion of a possible optimisation process resulting in an ultimate double seal. It is postulated that this would be the highest performance that can ever be achieved with a double clearance configuration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sangan, Carl M"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Such models are useful in forcing the designer to state their intentions precisely, and for testing (design) properties. However, we identify two problems in the direct utilization of event-based design-time models in the governance of live (running) systems: (i) over-specification of constraints on agent autonomy and (ii) generation of design-time model artefacts. In this paper we present a methodology to tackle these two problems and extract the run-time model from the design-time one.

Once placed, fresh mortar is dewatered by brick and during this time the volume fraction water content of the mortar is reduced. An equation is derived relating this change in water content to the bulk resistance of the mortar. Experimental measurements on hydraulic lime mortars placed in contact with brick prisms confirm the theoretical predictions. Further, the results indicate the time at which dewatering of a mortar bed of given depth is completed.

The Mandatory Life Sentence (MLS) replaced it. The MLS is to this day a political sentence. This thesis examines the MLS in terms of law, policy, practice and management, and, considers through the discourse of prisoners and staff how men who murder experience life imprisonment and the concept of release. My research draws on in depth interviews with 18 prisoners who had experience of life in open conditions and 10 professionals. This thesis contributes to our understanding of the impact of long-term imprisonment, indeterminacy and the management of a murderous identity within open conditions and the community. Analysis of the data indicates that prisoners ascription of identities is based on their perceptions of the nature of the offence, risk, guilt and the appropriateness of the MLS. The prisoners through the implementation of spoiled, co-existing and intersecting identities mediated the impact of the MLS. The research also indicates that prisoner experience of life in closed prison did little to prepare them for the reality of open prison and life in the community. As they near the end of the sentence identities produced to cope with imprisonment become redundant. On or near release the challenge for them became how to implement and/or manage co-existing identities. My study considers how the MLS can be perceived as differentiating the prisoner from other indeterminate prisoners historically in terms of policy, in staff and prisoner’s perceptions of practice and the MLS prisoner’s reflections on their own identities. The findings also bring into question current policy and practice within open conditions and the opportunities available for MLS prisoners nearing release.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clifford, Jenney L"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It has been assumed that the answers to these problems can be identified, codified and passed on to others, resulting in a kind of professionalism by protocol. But, as Dreyfus \u0026 Dreyfus (2005) have pointed out, there is a qualitative shift in the practice of experts when compared to novices and beginners.

In order to understand the evolution of mating frequency, we need to determine the consequences of increased mating frequency for offspring. We conducted an experiment in Drosophila melanogaster in which we manipulated the mating frequency of mothers and examined the survival and fecundity of the mothers and their daughters. We found that mothers with the highest mating frequency had accelerated mortality and more rapid reproductive senescence. On average, they had 50% shorter lives and 30% lower lifetime reproductive success (LRS) than did mothers with the lowest mating frequency. However, mothers with the highest mating frequency produced daughters with 28% greater LRS. This finding implies that frequent mating stimulates crossgenerational fitness trade-offs such that maternal fitness is reduced while offspring fitness is enhanced. We evaluate these results using a demographic metric of inclusive fitness. We show that the costs and benefits of mating frequency depend on the growth rate of the population. In an inclusive fitness context, there was no evidence that increased mating frequency results in fitness costs for mothers. These results indicate that cross-generational fitness trade-offs have an important role in sexual selection and life-history evolution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Priest, Nicholas","Galloway, L F","Roach, D A"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Days during the solar maximum years 2002, 2003 and 2004 have been chosen to display results when the ionospheric delays are large and variable.

This realisation, coupled with an increased drive towards ensuring the sustainability of the energy supply system, has lead many, including the United Kingdom government to investigate the options for moving away from traditional fossil fuel-burning generation methods towards “lowcarbon”\r\ngenerators, such as renewables and nuclear power. Specifically, wind power, the more mature systems (with the exception of hydro power) of the available renewable energy supply, and nuclear power, a technology seen as producing large amounts of electricity with very few associated greenhouse emissions, have been promoted but also pitted against each other by analysts and policy makers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis work aims to provide a balanced analysis of wind power and nuclear power with respect to their effects on the natural environment. As such, modeling has been undertaken of a Generation III+ nuclear reactor, an onshore wind farm located in southern Scotland and an offshore wind farm near the Thames estuary while environmental indicators have been created to permit the comparative assessment of these three electricity generation technologies, in a U.K. context. These indicators thus facilitate an assessment of the energy requirements, the associated greenhouse gas emissions, the natural resource requirements, as well as the displaced carbon dioxide emissions from operation of each power plant. A parametric analysis has also been conducted to show the range of likely variations in each indicator’s values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe results of this research show that all three technologies demonstrate similar performance with respect to their energetic and environmental impacts. More specifically, the wind farms demonstrate better energy gain ratios than the nuclear power plant when they are credited for not depleting non-renewable fuel sources. The wind farms also are shown to pay back their energy investments faster than the nuclear power plant. On the other hand, the nuclear power plant is found to produce slightly lower greenhouse gas emissions than either onshore or offshore wind farms. With respect to the assessment of natural resource depletion, it is estimated that both wind farms need more land per unit of electricity produced than the nuclear power plant, but all three power plants permanently sequester similar amounts of water. The wind farms and the nuclear power plant are found to have similar performance with respect to their material requirements, while the calculation of the avoided emissions factors for all technologies are of similar orders of magnitude.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll results are shown to be highly sensitive to the assumptions made about the prospective lifecycles, and as such caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions about any comparative advantages.

This correlation is not a by-product of changes in nucleotide content, lifespan, body size, absolute brain size or genome size; is independent of phylogenetic effects; and is not restricted to brain expressed genes. This is the first report of a relationship between this fundamental and complex trait and changes in protein AA usage, possibly reflecting the high selective demands imposed by the process of encephalization across mammalian lineages.","bibo:AuthorList":["Castillo, Atahualpa","Gutierrez, Humberto","Monzon, Jimena","Urrutia, Araxi O"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15433,"sim:weight":0.297211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65748,"sim:weight":0.261026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24013,"sim:weight":0.198213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85444,"sim:weight":0.180241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.134976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.130976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.124253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is a complex bacterial zoonosis involving vertebrate hosts and hard ticks of the genus Ixodes. The causative agents, bacteria of the LB group of spirochaetes, form a species complex comprising 17 named species. As is the case for most microbial pathogens, epidemiological and ecological studies require appropriate genotyping. Although the use of single loci may provide rapid results, there are serious disadvantages, in particular when inferring evolutionary relationships or geographic population structure. A novel multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) system of the LB group spirochaetes has been developed based on housekeeping genes to overcome these problems. Here, the system is optimized and tested using extracted spirochaetal DNA directly from ticks and then utilized to obtain insights into the migration and spread of individual species as well as to investigate the evolutionary origins of the species complex. Species belonging to the LB group of spirochetes display different patterns and levels of host specialisation which makes this an ideal system to study the impact of host associations on spread of zoonotic tickborne\r\ndiseases. For example, Borrelia valaisiana and B. garinii are transmitted exclusively by birds while B. afzelii is transmitted by rodents. I demonstrate that the migration of the LB species is dependent on, and limited by, the migration of their respective hosts. I also show the presence of B. afzelii strains in England and, through the use of the MLSA scheme, demonstrate that the strains are highly structured. A close evolutionary relationship between B. afzelii and its rodent host species is shown. Furthermore, through phylogenetic analyses, some evidence of a coevolutionary relationship between the LB group species and their major group of vector species, the Ixodes persulcatus species complex, is presented and a Eurasian origin for the species group is suggested.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Vollmer, Stephanie"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2812777,"sim:weight":0.266662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2812587,"sim:weight":0.219411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":135024,"sim:weight":0.188602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.180681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.167185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86227,"sim:weight":0.119085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The influence of the thickness of both Co and Pt layers on the coercivity and switching behavior has been systematically investigated. The coercivity was found to depend strongly on the thickness of the Co layer and clear perpendicular magnetic anisotropy was observed in multilayer stacks with Co thickness ranging from 3 to 7 A. Upon increasing the Co thickness further the magnetization reverts to the in-plane direction and both the coercivity and the remanence drop rapidly, with the former becoming dominated by shape anisotropy. Increasing the thickness of the Pt buffer layer leads to improved perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with higher coercive fields. In contrast, the thickness of the Pt capping layers does not appear to have any systematic influence on the anisotropy in the range of 22-62 A. The coercivity can be further affected by the number of repeat Co layers in the stack due to exchange and magnetic coupling between adjacent Co layers. Upon increasing the thickness of the intermediate Pt spacer layer beyond 27 A, a transition from a coherent single-unit-like reversal to a sequential layer-by-layer reversal was observed. Structures with sharp switching fields and medium coercivity (50-150 Oe) have Co thickness fractions in the range 5 7 of the total stack height and should be well optimized for studying current-driven domain motion at low current densities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Ke","Wu,  M.

An over-arching theme that emerged from the study was owners’ concerns about guest suitability, particularly with regard to the ‘dirty work’ and/or ‘risky work’ they could present. A key influencing factor here was that the hotel also constituted the owner’s ‘home.’ For the ‘suitable ‘guest, hoteliers could demonstrate considerable scope for hospitableness through philanthropic and personalized emotion management. Hence what seemed to emerge was an image of the small hotel owner as an autonomous flexible emotion manager, relatively free to engage in human connectedness with the guest and capable of eschewing the strictures of customer sovereignty that can envelop corporate counterparts.

Iron depletion with SIH and its UVA-activated caged-derivative (i.e. 2NPE-SIH) led to significant cell death in all cell models presumably as a result of inhibition of G1/S progression in cell cycle. PIH and 2NPE-PIH on the other hand only caused transient growth retardation in cells due to delayed S Phase but with no apparent toxicity. The growth inhibitory/retardation effects of SIH/PIH or UVA-activated caged-SIH/PIH were related to their iron-chelating properties, as their saturation with iron could reverse their antiproliferative activity in the analysed skin cells. Taken together the results suggested that 2NPE-PIH which possesses very high iron chelating potential, but low antiproliferative activity (i.e. upon uncaging by UVA) is more suitable for skin photoprotection. In contrast, 2NPE-SIH which remains inactive inside the cells until its strong iron binding activity and high antiproliferative properties are activated by UVA, may offer a highly selective and dose-controlled alternative for treatment of hyperproliferative skin disorders such as skin cancer.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Aroun, Asma"],"dc:date":"2010-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.1167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.076257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0750286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.0716793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Little is known about the diversity and genetic population structure of I. ricinus across Europe. Genetic diversity of these tick populations may have implications on disease transmission. I. ricinus primers were designed for a number of mitochondrial genes and a Multilocus Sequence Typing-like Scheme (MLST) was devised. This was termed mitochondrial MLST (mtMLST). MLST has so far mainly been used for typing microbes, and the development of a MLST scheme for an arthropod vector is novel. Understanding the geographic structure of I. ricinus populations, in combination with studies regarding the migration of tick-borne microbial infections, e.g. Lyme borreliosis, is likely to illuminate important processes in the evolution and spread of tick-borne diseases.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Dinnis, Ruth Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":676173,"sim:weight":0.372165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2804529,"sim:weight":0.371136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2812447,"sim:weight":0.219411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":135024,"sim:weight":0.11269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86227,"sim:weight":0.0878432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

First, to what extent was the EU’s vision of ‘active ageing’ adopted in EU15 nations between 1995 and 2005? Second, what was the nature of policy reforms in these nations over this time period? Finally, which sub-groups within the older age cohort (here defined as between 50-74)1 were subject to active ageing policies in these countries? The methodology employed was cross-national policy analysis of EU15 nations’ policies for employment and retirement, encompassing the retention and re-engagement of older individuals in the labour market. The policy areas included are unemployment benefits, active labour market policies, state pension ages, early retirement routes and incentives for the deferral of pension receipt, in line with the EU targets and guidelines regarding ‘active ageing’. In addition, model biographies (divided according to age and contribution records) were employed to address the differential policy treatment of individuals within the older age cohort in terms of the various eligibility criteria and policy options available over the ten year period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe data indicates that though EU15 nations have made progress towards the EU policy prescriptions for active ageing, there is variation in a number of respects. First, nations differed in terms of their policy contexts, and as a result had lesser or greater distances to travel towards the EU vision of active ageing. Second, and related, these policy contexts to a degree directed subsequent national reforms and retrenchment, thus resulting in different policy approaches. Finally, at the micro-level, there is variation with regard to the policy treatment of individuals within the age cohort in EU15 nations. As a result, the active ageing policy logic is applied to older individuals differently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn terms of its contributions to knowledge, this thesis therefore provides more nuanced accounts of both the recommodification and reserve army of labour literatures. The recommodification of labour argument suggests that nations are moving away from decommodifying welfare arrangements to focus on the recommodification of labour yet the data demonstrate a great deal of variation in EU15 nations, in terms of their original policies for decommodification, their subsequent retrenchment and the type of policies introduced that recommodify labour. With regard to the reserve army of labour literature, the shift towards active ageing policies is part of a cyclical process whereby older workers are drawn into and ejected from the labour markets in periods of low and high unemployment respectively. The data however indicate that as the political economy of ageing literature suggests, ageing is not a homogenous experience and differential policy treatment within age cohorts maintains and exacerbates divergence at the micro level. Thus whilst the recommodification and reserve army of labour literatures suggest all individuals are being drawn into the labour market, the data emphasises differences at the micro level in terms of policy treatment, in line with the political economy of ageing literature\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Hamblin, Kate A"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108279,"sim:weight":0.293994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56993,"sim:weight":0.182975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.177737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The devices were investigated for the detection of excitations of both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic spins in the magnetoresistance. Electron spin antiresonance was electrically detected, where spin flips are propelled by two transitions: one activated by snake orbit oscillations in the slanted magnetic field, the other by the microwaves. The double resonance forms a dark state which blocks spin flips, decreases Overhauser shift and freezes snake orbit drift, therefore changing the conduction in the 2DEG. The antiresonance is quantitatively described in the coherent population trapping framework. Collective and localised spin wave modes in dysprosium and cobalt gratings were detected as well in the 2DEG. Such effects were investigated as a function of microwave power, temperature, tilt angle of the applied magnetic field, and by varying the structural and material parameters to change the strength of dipolar interactions. The data reveal two types of spin waves. Dipolar magnetisation waves propagate across the grating through the magnetostatic interaction between stripes. An analytical expression of their dispersion curve was derived and a good fit of the ferromagnetic resonance broadening was obtained. The second type are dipolar edge spin waves which manifest through a series of sharp resonances at lower magnetic field. These waves are confined near the pole surfaces in spin wave ”wells”. The eigenfrequencies of the quantised modes were calculated and a qualitative explanation of the low field resonances was obtained.

We now extend this investigation to equine mesenteric arteries and investigate the cellular mechanisms. Invitro exposure of the large lateral cecal mesenteric artery to 4-min periods of 3.2 MHz continuous wave ultrasound at acoustic powers up to 145 mW induced reversible repeatable contraction. The magnitude of the response was linearly dependent on acoustic power and, at 145 mW, the mean increase in wall stress was 0.020 0.017 mN/mm2 (n\u003d 34). These results are consistent with our previous study and the effect was hypothesised to be thermally mediated. A 2C temperature rise produced an increase in intracellular calcium, measured by Fluo-4 fluorescence. Inhibition of the inward-rectifier potassium ion channel with BaCl2 (4 M) increased the response to ultrasound by 55% 49%, indicating a similar electrophysiologic basis to the response to mild hyperthermia. In small mesenteric arteries (0.5-1.0 mm diameter) mounted in a perfusion myograph, neither ultrasound exposure nor heating produced measureable vasoconstriction or a rise in intracellular calcium and we conclude that temperature-sensitive channels are absent or inactive in these small vessels. It, therefore, appears that response of blood vessels to ultrasound depends not only on the thermal properties of the vessels and surrounding tissues but also on the electrophysiology of the smooth muscle cells.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martin,  Eleanor M.","Duck, F A","Winlove,  C.

Both training conditions included education in relation to opioid guidelines. Following education, 1 condition included training aimed at improving psychological flexibility and the other included training in practical knowledge and skills related to pain management. Eighty-one general practitioners (GPs) took part in the study, each having been randomly assigned to 1 of the training conditions. It proved easy to recruit GPs to the training. Overall, GPs demonstrated increased knowledge of opioid prescribing for chronic pain and decreases in concerns related to prescribing following training. However, there were no changes observed in reported prescribing practices or in secondary measures of well-being. There were also no significant differences between the training conditions, other than a greater increase in intention to use prescribing guidelines in the psychological flexibility condition. Feasibility and acceptability of the training methods were generally rated high. The psychological flexibility condition was rated higher than the comparison condition in terms of interest and satisfaction. Finally, processes of psychological flexibility before and after training significantly correlated with measures of GP well-being, providing partial support for the relevance of these processes as a focus in GP training. Perspective: A training intervention for GPs including education on opioid guidelines for chronic pain and psychological flexibility training increased knowledge of prescribing and reduced concerns but did not change prescribing behavior or well-being.

The problem continues to grow as the use of telecommunications becomes more pop- ular. In order to compensate for increased in demand, telecommunication operating frequencies have to be raised, yielding larger channel capacity. However, raising the operating frequency has the adverse result of intensifying the attenuation effects of the troposphere. At high frequencies, such as V-band, rain is known to cause the most severe attenuation. It has been shown that model data for numerical weather prediction, combined with propagation prediction models, can be used to forecast telecommunication link atten- uation. The forecast of attenuation can be used to improve the effectiveness of fade mitigation techniques. A key problem in determining rain attenuation from rainfall rate is the considerable variability of the raindrop size distribution (DSD). Based on the analysis of disdrometer and numerical weather prediction model data, the aim of this work is to constrain the parameters of the DSD and ultimately generate proba- bilistic forecasts of attenuation. Using disdrometer analysis, a relationship between mean raindrop size and rainfall rate is established, and a link between drop concentration and rainfall rate is also demon- strated. The DSD is shown to vary with season and shows some small relationships with meteorological parameters. It is concluded that, despite some relation of the DSD with rainfall rate and meteorological parameters, there are too many variables to conclusively recreate the DSD.

At 30-40GHz the DSD is shown to have little impact on the attenuation-rainfall rate relationship.

The work focuses on RLCs because they are able to harness a large degree of power and influence vis-à-vis the nation state, which increases their visibility in EU policy.

In response to pressures of both globalisation and localisation, the government introduced a school policy of learning a Taiwanese minority language, in addition to Mandarin, in 2005. The majority of parents, however, are not keen to encourage their children to learn a Taiwanese second language compared to the ‘trend’ of learning English (as a foreign language). This study explores family language policies using a multiple-case-study strategy with twelve families whose children attend a language school in Taichung, Taiwan, with two additional cases from different geolinguistic areas. The main focus is on how parents form their ideologies about language and language learning. The data were gathered using semi-structured interviews. The macro- and micro-factors which underpin the parents’ language ideologies are the central focus of analysis. Amongst these families the process of ideology formation involves more than three languages, English, Mandarin, Minnan and Hakfa (which, in this study, is the only representative of other minority languages spoken in Taiwan). The three Chinese languages appear as ‘mother tongue’ in various combinations amongst the parents in the study. The findings indicate that the influence of macro- and micro-factors on parents’ language ideologies is complex and interactive, rather than linear. Significant macro-factors identified include the local, national and global sociolinguistic environments, government policies and economic factors, notably the labour market. Macro-factors, as well as micro-factors, do not influence parents’ ideologies in isolation from each other. Similar, shared macro-contexts are responded to in diverse ways by the parents in the study, with familial mother tongue, educational experiences and different perceptions of the social roles of language all playing a part. Parents’ language ideologies are, therefore, clearly not structurally determined, but neither do the parents act as ‘free agents’ in their ideological choices which, in turn, have an impact on family language management and language practices. The complexity and fluidity of the Taiwanese language situation and the rapid social, political and economic changes that are taking place in the community make this study particularly valuable in enhancing our understanding of how personal language ideologies evolve.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen, Yi Ling"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The smallest positive real eigenvalue of the problem contains valuable information about the status of the fission chain reaction in the nuclear reactor (i.e. the criticality of the reactor), and thus plays an important role in the design and safety of nuclear power stations. Because of the practical importance, efficient numerical methods to solve the criticality problem are needed, and these are the focus of this thesis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the theory we consider the time-independent neutron transport equation in the monoenergetic homogeneous case with isotropic scattering and vacuum boundary conditions. This is an unsymmetric integro-differential equation in 5 independent variables, modelling transport, scattering, and fission, where the dependent variable is the neutron angular flux. We show that, before discretisation, the nonsymmetric\r\neigenproblem for the angular flux is equivalent to a related eigenproblem for the scalar flux, involving a symmetric positive definite weakly singular integral operator(in space only). Furthermore, we prove the existence of a simple smallest positive real eigenvalue with a corresponding eigenfunction that is strictly positive in the interior of the reactor. We discuss approaches to discretise the problem and present discretisations that preserve the underlying symmetry in the finite dimensional form.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe thesis then describes methods for computing the criticality in nuclear reactors, i.e. the smallest positive real eigenvalue, which are applicable for quite general geometries and physics. In engineering practice the criticality problem is often solved iteratively, using some variant of the inverse power method. Because of the high dimension, matrix representations for the operators are often not available and the inner solves needed for the eigenvalue iteration are implemented by matrix-free inneriterations. This leads to inexact iterative methods for criticality computations, for which there appears to be no rigorous convergence theory. The fact that, under appropriate assumptions, the integro-differential eigenvalue problem possesses an underlying symmetry (in a space of reduced dimension) allows us to perform a systematic convergence analysis for inexact inverse iteration and related methods. In particular, this theory provides rather precise criteria on how accurate the inner solves need to be in order for the whole iterative method to converge. The theory is illustrated with numerical examples on several test problems of physical relevance, using GMRES as the inner solver.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also illustrate the use of Monte Carlo methods for the solution of neutron transport source problems as well as for the criticality problem. Links between the steps in the Monte Carlo process and the underlying mathematics are emphasised and numerical examples are given. Finally, we introduce an iterative scheme (the so-called “method of perturbation”) that is based on computing the difference between the solution of the problem of interest and the known solution of a base problem. This situation is very common in the design stages for nuclear reactors when different materials are tested, or the material properties change due to the burn-up of fissile material.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe explore the relation ofthe method of perturbation to some variants of inverse iteration, which allows us to give convergence results for the method of perturbation. The theory shows that the method is guaranteed to converge if the perturbations are not too large and the inner problems are solved with sufficiently small tolerances. This helps to explain the divergence of the method of perturbation in some situations which we give numerical examples of. We also identify situations, and present examples, in which the method of perturbation achieves the same convergence rate as standard shifted inverse iteration.

Many island species have, however, become extinct following the arrival of humans, and many others remain threatened. This thesis focuses on one of these threatened island species; the St. Helena Plover, Charadrius sanctaehelenae. The objectives of my PhD were threefold: to understand the current status of the St. Helena Plover, to investigate aspects of its environment that may threaten its persistence, and to compare conservation options. Observational data were used to understand how variation in the environment influences the plover’s distribution and demography. This information was used to inform a controlled trial investigating the use of nest exclosures as a way to improve productivity. New understanding of the species’ population ecology was brought together to create a stochastic meta-population model. This model was used to understand the influence of demographic and life history parameters on the population growth rate and to compare alternative conservation options. Indicators of the future status of the St. Helena Plover population appear mixed; with numbers predicted to decline slowly, but with a high chance of species persistence over the timeframe simulated, 50 years. Nest predation by introduced species, predominately cats, was predicted to suppress nest survival and bring productivity at some sites below that required for population stability. The use of nest exclosures did not increase nest survival and led to a decrease in adult survival. Habitat characteristics were more important in determining the species distribution than influencing its demography. The plovers appeared to select breeding habitat to maximise the visibility from the nest and the accessibility of invertebrate prey. Simulations suggested that predator control would have a large beneficial effect on the population growth rate and that concurrent habitat improvement would have greater than additive benefits. Targets for conservation management include Deadwood Plain; predator control as this key site was predicted to lead to the largest increase in the overall population growth rate, and Man and Horse; there may be potential at this site to increase adult survival, which was found to be the most influential demographic parameter.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burns, Fiona E"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.240759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86207,"sim:weight":0.228502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108770,"sim:weight":0.228121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15554,"sim:weight":0.22614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.202294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15174,"sim:weight":0.169589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.156659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To avoid this we present an adaptive multiscale finite element method as an enhancement to the adaptive local-global method of Durlofsky, Efendiev and Ginting.

To gain this information, TEC calculated from instruments measuring Faraday rotation on signals from geostationary satellites were used.

It aims to gain an understanding of what theories and processes constitute preparation for work in Russian schools. In the light of how they have changed as a result of the fall of communism in 1991, the thesis seeks to explore the ways in which students are prepared to enter the world of work. The socio-cultural and activity theory is employed to explore the relationship between students’ engagement in pedagogic practices and macro historical transformations in Russia that have affected it.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThe methodology includes a documentary analysis of teacher-training textbooks, which were used in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and a case study of preparation for work in a secondary school in Perm, Russia, which involved a group of thirty teachers and thirty students. Biographical interviews were conducted with thirty individuals who lived through the economic and social transformations caused by the events of 1991.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThe analysis of the data demonstrates that preparation for work in Russian schools is a combination of two pedagogic processes – vospitanie, which refers to the overall up-bringing of children, and ‘professional orientation’, which provides career guidance. The literature review and documentary analysis have revealed that the events of 1991 have influenced the ideological underpinning of vospitanie and professional orientation, especially in terms of humanisation of pedagogic processes. However, with regard to the conceptual framework, vospitanie and professional orientation have remained relatively intact. These pedagogic concepts emphasise a dialogic relationship between students and teachers. The case study analysis shows that the teachers’ conceptualisation of vospitanie and professional orientation reflect the findings from the documentary analysis, but the teachers have interpreted the theory in the ways that reflect their various, historically formed views of preparation for work. Some of these views, expressed by the teachers who were trained in the Soviet time, do not support the new humanistic approach advocated in the literature; instead, the focus is on differentiation by ability and on academic achievement. Combined with the fact that the case study school does not offer practical vocational experience, this provides some explanation of why only those students who receive support from outside the school are better prepared than others to overcome the challenges of the new market economy. Those students who do not receive relevant support outside the school are developing dispositions towards employment, which are less likely to help them progress in the context of the market economy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Popova, Anna"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108075,"sim:weight":0.380882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.378474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.313367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.311727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.285184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These studies were often carried out in one location and/or during short time intervals. Many animals, however, migrate and spend their life in several geographically distinct locations, and they may either adopt behaviours specific to the local environment or keep consistent behaviours over ecologically distinct locations. Long-distance migratory species offer excellent opportunities to test whether the animals maintain their personalities over large geographical scale, although the practical difficulties associated with these studies have hampered such tests. Here, we demonstrate for the first time consistency in disturbance tolerance behaviour in a long-distance migratory bird, using the common crane Grus grus as an ecological model species. Cranes that hatched in undisturbed habitats in Finland choose undisturbed migratory stop-over sites in Hungary, 1300-2000 km away from their breeding ground. This is remarkable, because these sites are not only separated by large distances, they also differ ecologically: the breeding sites are wooded bogs and subarctic tundra, whereas the migratory stop-over sites are temperate zone alkaline grasslands. The significance of our study goes beyond evolutionary biology and behavioural ecology: local effects on behaviour may carry over large distances, and this hitherto hidden implication of habitat selection needs to be incorporated into conservation planning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vegvari, Z","Barta, Z","Mustakallio, P","Szekely, Tamas"],"dc:date":"2011-12-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84355,"sim:weight":0.185222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108177,"sim:weight":0.147827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.147341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85198,"sim:weight":0.140511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.136615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15554,"sim:weight":0.136386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108766,"sim:weight":0.130163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.108065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While trials have provided good support for treatment effectiveness through follow-ups of as long as seven months, the longer-term impact is not known. The present study of 108 participants with chronic pain examined outcomes three years after treatment completion and included analyses of two key treatment processes, acceptance of pain and values-based action. Overall, results indicated significant improvements in emotional and physical functioning relative to the start of treatment, as well as good maintenance of treatment gains relative to an earlier follow-up assessment. Effect size statistics were generally medium or large. At the three-year follow-up, 64.8% of patients had reliably improved in at least one key domain. Improvements in acceptance of pain and values-based action were associated with improvements in outcome measures. A \"treatment responder\" analysis, using variables collected at pre-treatment and shorter term follow-up, failed to identify any salient predictors of response.

Temperature-related mortality effects, salmonellosis and coastal flooding-induced mental health impacts resulting from climate change are isolated from the effects of socio-economic change for the 2011-2040 and 2071-2100 time periods. The temperature-induced mortality effects of climate change include both positive and negative effects, for winter (cold) and summer (heat) effects, respectively, and have welfare costs (and benefits) of up to 100 billion Euro annually by the later time-period, though these are unevenly distributed across countries. The role of uncertainty in quantifying these effects is explored through sensitivity analysis on key parameters. This investigates climate model output, climate scenario, impact function, the existence and extent of acclimatisation, and the choice of physical and monetary metrics. While all of these lead to major differences in reported results, acclimatisation is particularly important in determining the size of the health impacts, and could influence the scale and form of public adaptation at the EU and national level. The welfare costs for salmonellosis from climate change are estimated at potentially several hundred million Euro annually by the period 2071-2100. Finally, a scoping assessment of the health costs of climate change from coastal flooding, focusing on mental health problems such as depression, are estimated at up to 1.5 billion Euro annually by the period 2071-2100.","bibo:AuthorList":["Watkiss, Paul","Hunt, Alistair"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

All methods of energy production involve resource uncertainties and environmental impacts. A clear example of this is the use of fossil fuels which present three main problems, being: finite resources; significant contribution to environmental pollution; and reliance on imports. Hence there is a clear need to reduce the use of fossil fuels for energy. Bioenergy has the potential to both displace fossil fuels, and reduce the effect of climate change by sequestering carbon dioxide during the production of biomass. It is also possible that bioenergy can reduce the UK’s dependence on energy imports and boost the rural economy. This thesis provides an interdisciplinary assessment of bioenergy production in the UK. Due to the complexities of bioenergy systems several appraisal methods have been used. An initial study examined the barriers to and drivers for UK bioenergy development as a whole. It was found that for projects to be successful, bioenergy schemes need to be both economically attractive and environmentally sustainable. A biomass resource assessment was then completed using the South West of England as a case study. This demonstrates that bioenergy can make a useful contribution to the UK’s energy supply, due to the diverse range of biomass feedstocks currently available. However a range of barriers and constraints will need to be overcome if the UK is to reach its bioenergy potential. To assess the potential environmental impacts of bioenergy production different case studies were selected. Life cycle assessment is widely regarded as one of the best methodologies for the evaluation of burdens associated with bioenergy production. This was applied, alongside net energy analysis, to a small-scale biomass gasification plant which uses wood waste as a feedstock. As an alternative biomass source, the perennial energy crops Miscanthus and Willow were also assessed. Several different scenarios of biomass cultivation, transportation, and energy conversion were then compared, to assess the potential environmental impacts. Biomass gasification offers good potential for reducing fossil fuel use and climate change impacts. Nonetheless embodied energy in the construction phase can be high and other impacts such as particulate emissions, ecotoxicity and land use can be important. Therefore environmental benefits are maximised when both electricity and heat are utilised together, and when waste is used as feedstock. The ultimate applicability of biomass gasification is restricted by the quantity of feedstocks that can be made available for conversion. Perennial energy crops offer several advantages over annual crops including more positive energy balances and reduced agro-chemical inputs. However their cultivation needs to be carefully sited to avoid issues of land use change and the displacement of food crops. This study shows that each bioenergy production pathway needs to be assessed using a range of appraisal techniques, which include: biomass resource assessment, technical and economic feasibility, life cycle assessment and net energy analysis. It concludes that biomass gasification CHP offers an alternative to fossil fuel generation but more technical knowledge is required in the UK if it is to become widely used for biomass energy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Adams, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23944,"sim:weight":0.622382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999568,"sim:weight":0.592826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.256169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67390,"sim:weight":0.239393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.235517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.235517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using the cationic surfactant/polymer system, we built on the previous research by altering the head group area to tail volume ratio of the surfactants being used to allow control over the final mesostructure within the films. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) was used to study the bulk solution while neutron and x-ray reflectivity and grazing incidence diffraction were used to study the films. Using this system we have also developed the previous work, studying the incorporation of sparingly soluble species in films, by studying the encapsulation of hydrophobic and amphiphilic species into the surfactant micelles and therefore into the films as a function of micelle and film structure. We have also studied, using Fluorescence spectroscopy, the subsequent release of these species from the films. The cat-anionic surfactant/polymer system was discovered more recently and therefore has not had as much previous research performed on it. It is of particular interest because it allows films to be formed from a variety of different polymers where the cationic system currently has only been found to form films with one polymer. Using this cat-anionic system we have studied the surfactant interactions in the bulk with SANS, ultra-SANS and spin-echo-SANS to determine the structure over a wide length range. This data is compared to cryo-SEM results. In particular cryo-SEM and USANS have been used to validate modelling from the new technique of SESANS. We then studied the film formation with x-ray and neutron reflectivity. As well as forming from a wider range of polymers, these films are much thicker and more robust, which may be due to the larger scale aggregates formed in solution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wasbrough, Matthew"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The impact of polymers and adhesives","bibo:abstract":"Polymers and composites in general, and surfaces, interfaces and adhesion in particular, are important and interesting areas of science with important technological applications. The polymer industry has shown broadly exponential growth since the middle of the last century and aspires to continued growth. Thus the science has contributed to the growth in prosperity and to the cognate problems, in particular environmental problems. There is a crisis which results from depletion of fossil fuels resources as raw materials and energy sources, and from pollution, especially greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nIn this paper some of the ways are discussed in which these sciences can contribute to reduction of the environmental impact of the associated industries. Much can be done modifying existing procedures for example by replacing the use of organic solvents by aqueous systems, change of blowing agents and pretreatment chemicals.\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nInterest in polymers from renewable resources such as starch, gelatine and natural rubber has intensified and new natural sources are being developed, some by use of fermentation techniques or genetic modification. Novel polymers and co-polymers from polysaccharides and based on polyhydroxyalkonates are being developed. There is much interest in \"biorefineries\", which can produce organic chemicals of significance to the polymer industry from a biomass feedstock. \r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThe management of polymer wastes is a difficult area and recycling while technically feasible, may not be environmentally attractive. In addressing the environmental impact of polymers and composites it is essential to consider the environmental impact from \"cradle to grave\". Such lifecycle analysis may show that some renewable resources or recycling techniques have a greater environmental impact than the technologies which they aspire to replace. \r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThe question remains as to whether these technical solutions, however successfully developed, will be adequate to resolve the environmental crisis described above. In theory, the Laws of Thermodynamics must cause reflection on the concept of indefinite growth within a finite system. In practice, the present global per caput energy usage coupled with projected population growth and global aspirations to a \"North American\" lifestyle must be compared with plausible estimates of material and energy reserves.","bibo:AuthorList":["Packham, David E."],"dc:date":"2012-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.333818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.31834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5843844,"sim:weight":0.271424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85356,"sim:weight":0.18049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Plasticity in the adult bee brain has been demonstrated in previous experiments. This experiment was conducted to identify the potentials and limitations of MicroCT scanning “live” bees as a more comprehensive, noninvasive method for brain morphology and physiology. Benchtop and synchrotron MicroCT were used to scan live bees. For improved tissue differentiation, bees were fed and injected with radiographic contrast. Images of Optic lobes, ocelli, antennal lobes and mushroom bodies were visualized in 2D and 3D rendering modes. Scanning of live bees (for the first time) enabled minimallyinvasive imaging of physiological processes such as passage of contrast from gut to haemolymph and preliminary brain perfusion studies. The use of CT for studying insects (collectively termed Diagnostic Radioentomology “DR”) is increasing. Our results indicate that it is feasible to observe plasticity of the honey bee brain “in vivo” using DR and that progressive, realtime observations of these changes can be followed in individual live bees. Limitations of live bee scanning such as movement errors and poor tissue differentiation were identified, however there is great potential for invivo, noninvasive DR imaging of the honey bee for brain morphology and physiology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greco, Mark K","Tong, J","Soleimani, Manuchehr","Bell, D","Schäfer, M O"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24858,"sim:weight":0.246458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26194,"sim:weight":0.211726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.145274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.106238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The onset conditions for convective instability in the plane porous layer are investigated using a linear stability analysis. Constant heat flux boundary conditions are formulated according to the Amiri-Vafai-Kuzay Model A, where the boundary walls are assumed as impermeable and with a high thermal conductance. The normal mode analysis of the perturbations imposed on the basic state leads to a one-dimensional eigenvalue problem, solved numerically to determine the neutral stability condition. Analytical solutions are found for the limit of small wave numbers, and in the regime where the conductivity of the solid phase is much larger than the conductivity of the fluid phase. A comparison with the corresponding results under conditions of local thermal equilibrium is carried out. The critical conditions for the onset of convection correspond to a zero wave number only when the inter-phase heat transfer coefficient is sufficiently large. Otherwise, the critical conditions correspond to a nonzero wave number.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barletta,  A.","Rees, D.

Many fundamental questions concerning PbO(2) remain unanswered, principally: (i) is the bulk material a metal or a semiconductor, and (ii) what is the source of the high levels of conductivity? We calculate the electronic structure and defect physics of PbO(2), using a hybrid density functional, and show that it is an n-type semiconductor with a small indirect band gap of similar to 0.2 eV. The origin of electron carriers in the undoped material is found to be oxygen vacancies, which forms a donor state resonant in the conduction band. A dipole-forbidden band gap combined with a large carrier induced Moss-Burstein shift results in a large effective optical band gap. The model is supported by neutron diffraction, which reveals that the oxygen sublattice is only 98.4% occupied, thus confirming oxygen substoichiometry as the electron source.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scanlon,  D.

The DDD for individual digits, and composite scores of multiple digits, were calculated at baseline (23 degrees C), and at 10 min following CST. The discriminatory capacity of the mean DDD, and the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful DDD of \u0026lt;-1 degrees C, were assessed for individual digits and composite indices, at baseline and following cold challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eResults: There was a more pronounced decrease of the DDD (indicating reduced distal perfusion) following CST in patients with PRP compared to SSc. The disparity in response to CST between groups narrowed the differences that were present at baseline, reducing the discriminatory capacity of the DDD for all endpoints. Sparing of the thumbs occurs to a greater extent in SSc (P\u0026lt;0.005) compared with PRP (P\u0026lt;0.05) but does not facilitate differentiation between groups. Large variability of the DDD within groups precludes easy differentiation between disease states.

The unprocessed CMOS aluminium electrodes are modified using anodisation and plating techniques which do not require intricate and expensive semiconductor processing equipment and can be performed on the bench-top as a clean-room environment is not required. The resulting transducers are able to detect both the fast electrical activity of neurons and the slow changes in impedance of growing and dividing cells. By using standard semiconductor fabrication techniques and well-established technologies, the approach can form the basis of cell-based biosensors and transducers for high throughput drug discovery assays, neuroprosthetics and as a basic research tool in biosciences.

This study investigates this paradigm by carrying out a streamlined life cycle assessment (LCA) of silica aerogel. This unique, nanoporous translucent insulation material has the lowest thermal conductivity of any solid, retaining up to four times as much heat as conventional insulation, whilst being highly transparent to light and solar radiation. Monolithic silica aerogel has been cited as the \u0027holy grail\u0027 of future glazing technology. Alternatively, translucent granular aerogel is now being produced on a commercial scale. In each case, many solvents are used in production, often accompanied by intensive drying processes, which may consume large amounts of energy and CO2. To date, there has been no peer-reviewed LCA of this material conducted to the ISO 14000 standard. Primary data for this \u0027cradle-to-factory gate\u0027 LCA is collected for silica aerogel made by low and high temperature supercritical drying. In both cases, the mass of raw materials and electricity usage for each process is monitored to determine the total energy use and CO2 burden. Findings are compared against the predicted operational savings arising from retrofitting translucent silica aerogel to a single glazed window to upgrade its thermal performance. Results should be treated as a conservative estimate as the aerogel is produced in a laboratory, which has not been developed for mass manufacture or refined to reduce its environmental impact. Furthermore, the samples are small and assumptions to upscale the manufacturing volume occur without major changes to production steps or equipment used. Despite this, parity between the CO2 burden and CO2 savings is achieved in less than 2 years, indicating that silica aerogel can provide a measurable environmental benefit.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dowson, Mark","Grogan, Michael","Birks, Timothy","Harrison, David","Craig, Salmaan"],"dc:date":"2012-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":11525,"sim:weight":0.208988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11738,"sim:weight":0.157755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11430,"sim:weight":0.157755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.141488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two rubber fins: one with a NACA aerofoil shape, the other with a biomimetic shape, were used in two asymmetric oscillations in a static water tank. The force generation patterns within the parameter space and the response to the change in stroke timing, were dependant on the fin. The biomimetic fin produced peak force at a similar frequency and amplitude regardless of its kinematics and duty cycle. The response of the NACA fin, however, was dependent on the duty cycle. For the NACA fin, the fast-to-centreline kinematics caused larger resultant force over a narrow range of frequencies. For the fast-to-maximum-amplitude stroke, a lower resultant force was achieved, but over a larger range of frequencies. Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) analysis showed the wake pattern of shed vortices.

Small particles are treated grand canonically, their influence being parameterized in terms of their packing fraction in the reservoir nsr. Two Monte Carlo simulation schemes-the geometrical cluster algorithm, and staged particle insertion-are deployed to obtain accurate depletion potentials for a number of combinations of q\u0026le0.1 and nsr. After applying corrections for simulation finite-size effects, the depletion potentials are compared with the prediction of new density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the insertion trick using the Rosenfeld functional and several subsequent modifications. While agreement between the DFT and simulation is generally good, significant discrepancies are evident at the largest reservoir packing fraction accessible to our simulation methods, namely, nsr\u003d0.35. These discrepancies are, however, small compared to those between simulation and the much poorer predictions of the Derjaguin approximation at this nsr. The recently proposed morphometric approximation performs better than Derjaguin but is somewhat poorer than DFT for the size ratios and small-sphere packing fractions that we consider. The effective potentials from simulation, DFT, and the morphometric approximation were used to compute the second virial coefficient B2 as a function of nsr. Comparison of the results enables an assessment of the extent to which DFT can be expected to correctly predict the propensity toward fluid-fluid phase separation in additive binary hard-sphere mixtures with q\u0026le0.1. In all, the new simulation results provide a fully quantitative benchmark for assessing the relative accuracy of theoretical approaches for calculating depletion potentials in highly size-asymmetric mixtures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ashton, Douglas J","Wilding, Nigel B","Roth,  Roland","Evans,  Robert"],"dc:date":"2011-12-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100236,"sim:weight":0.251833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.177838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176882,"sim:weight":0.140441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.140153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.127629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2278959,"sim:weight":0.120627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.111116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This research finds that a governance structure controlled by a few elites from the market or the state inevitably fails to meet the public interest. Strategic decision making theory (SDT) in this research incorporates Barzelay’s institutional processualism (Barzelay, 2003, Barzelay and Gallego, 2006) and Moe’s concept of purposive incentive (1981), in order to explain ‘changing’ governance and the reasons why some actors voluntarily participate in democratic decision making despite ‘collective action problems’. The Korean water sector, the case of this research, illustrates these ideas by showing that governance changes result from intense interaction between interested and purposive actors, critical events, and context. SDT analysis is complemented by an econometric analysis, which shows that the decentralisation of decision making power does not necessarily come with better performance unless proper governance is introduced. Solutions suggested in this thesis are democratic industrial governance and, as an intermediate means, a democratic regulatory agency, which is beyond merely (economic) regulation to remedy ‘market failure’ and economic bureaucrats pursuing long term career path.","bibo:AuthorList":["Min, Kyung-Jin"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.314809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86062,"sim:weight":0.311484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.220987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Mutants of cell wall-binding domain (PFam04122) containing proteins CD1036, CD2735, CD2784, Cwp66, CD2791, Cwp84, CD2795 and the flagella cap (FliD) were created. Mutants were characterised with regard to growth, sporulation, toxin production, adhesion in vitro, and, for the Cwp84 mutant, using the in vivo hamster model. The surface-located cysteine protease, Cwp84, was found to play a key role in maturation of the C. difficile S-layer, yet the Cwp84 mutant still caused disease with a similar pathology to the wildtype.

One key to ultimately understand the molecular basis of sperm function is to comprehensively characterize its biochemical composition. This crucial information has been lacking, as molecular characterization of the sperm cell cannot be assessed by classic gene expression assays since mature spermatozoa are transcriptionaly inert. Whole-cell shotgun proteomic approaches have revolutionized the molecular analysis of sperm form and function. We have utilized improved methodologies to re-analyze the D. melanogaster sperm proteome and characterize five additional Drosophila species sperm proteomes. This methodology, which included a 1D SDS-PAGE prefractionation step, resulted in good reproducibility between biological replicates and high quality sperm proteomes. An interspecific analysis of the sperm proteomes revealed that despite variation in protein composition, Drosophila sperm proteomes have a consistent functional profile and 519 proteins were identified a being conserved across the melanogaster subgroup within a phylogenetic framework. Evolution of the sperm proteome was explored in Mus musculus through the utilization of targeted proteomic datasets completed, which provided subcellular localizations for sperm components. This study resulted in several novel findings, including evidence for accelerated evolution as well as an enrichment of positive selection on genes found in the cell membrane and acrosome. This may be a result of the selective pressures encountered by these membrane proteins during sperm development, maturation and transit through the female reproductive tract where the sperm cell membrane, and eventually the acrosome, are exposed to the extracellular milieu and are available for direct cell-cell interactions. These findings not only reveal the varying evolutionary pressures acting on a single cell type but also highlights the utility of the proteomics technique in clarifying protein interaction and evolutionary history.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wasbrough, E R"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The atmospheric emission between 1,000 and 1,800 nm arises almost entirely from a forest of extremely bright, very narrow hydroxyl emission lines that varies on timescales of minutes. The astronomical community has long envisaged the prospect of selectively removing these lines, while retaining high throughput between them.

In the coil there are two regions, the critical state region and the subcritical region. The model assumes that in the subcritical region the flux lines are parallel to the tape wide face. AC losses of the superconducting pancake coil are calculated using this model. Both calorimetric and electrical techniques were used to measure AC losses in the coil. The calorimetric method is based on measuring the boil-off rate of liquid nitrogen. The electric method used a compensation circuit to eliminate the inductive component to measure the loss voltage of the coil. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical calculations thus validating the anisotropic critical state model for loss estimations in the superconducting pancake coil.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yuan, Weijia","Coombs,  T.

They would also be the natural way to represent smooth interactions in mixed regression models, but for the fact that the tensor product constructions proposed to date are difficult or impossible to estimate using most standard mixed modelling software. This paper proposes a new approach to the construction of tensor product smooths, which allows the smooth to to be written as the sum of some fixed effects and some sets of i.i.d. Gaussian random effects: no previously published construction achieves this. Because of the simplicity of this random effects structure, our construction is useable with almost any flexible mixed modelling software, allowing smooth interaction terms to be readily incorporated into any Generalized Linear Mixed Model. To achieve the computationally convenient separation of smoothing penalties, the  construction differs from previous tensor product approaches in the penalties used to control smoothness, but the penalties have the advantage over several alternative approaches of being explicitly interpretable in terms of function shape. Like all tensor product smoothing methods, our approach builds up smooth functions of several variables from {\\em marginal} smooths of lower dimension, but unlike much of the previous literature we treat the general case in which the marginal smooths can be {\\em any} quadratically penalized basis expansion, and there can be any number of them. We also point out that the imposition of identifiability constraints on smoothers requires more care in the mixed model setting than it would in a simple additive model setting, and show how to deal with the issue. An interesting side effect of our construction is that an ANOVA-decomposition of the smooth can be read off from the estimates, although this is not our primary focus. We were motivated to undertake this work by applied problems in the analysis of abundance survey data, and two examples of this are presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wood, Simon N.","Scheipl, Fabian","Faraway, Julian J."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108991,"sim:weight":0.26225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18442,"sim:weight":0.256532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20346,"sim:weight":0.239284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.227263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19444,"sim:weight":0.224322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.217389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69506,"sim:weight":0.209015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.205361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147453,"sim:weight":0.196544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":240909,"sim:weight":0.187012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21493,"sim:weight":0.183332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

But coverage at sea is much less dense spatially and temporally, especially at high latitudes. Passive underwater acoustics has been established for several decades as a good and reliable tool to monitor the weather. The frequency spectra of different weather types have been well documented and acoustic disdrometers have been developed in several research environments. Nevertheless, many questions remain about the validity of some of these measurements, the best analysis approaches and the combination of different weather processes. This is particularly true in polar regions, where the loud and complex acoustics of ice-related processes adds to the difficulty of the task. This thesis focuses on the analysis of a broadband dataset acquired in an Arctic fjord (Kongsfjord, Svalbard), in summer 2007. Taken at 6 locations from the mouth of the fjord to the glaciers at its termination, measurements cover the combination of varying levels of rain (from none to light rain), wind (from none to 11 km/h), ice (from none to growlers and bergy bits), shipping (from none to a large cruise ship) and animal activity (including whales and diving seabirds). The recordings covered frequencies from 100 Hz to 48 kHz. Principal-Components Analysis identified 3 distinct frequency bands mostly related to noise from wind, rain and ice. Laboratory-based tank experiments were conducted to assess the physical sources of these components (from 100 Hz to 100 kHz), confirming the acoustic role of ice and the relevance of the frequency bands identified by Principal-Component Analysis. These experiments also identified for the first time the role of higher (up to 45 kHz) acoustic frequencies in the identification of ice-related processes such as scraping, colliding and melting. Principal-Component Analysis is shown to be a valuable and rigorous tool for identifying weather processes at sea, especially in complex combinations of wind, rain, ice and other factors. Analyses at frequencies higher than generally used also offer the potential of identifying specific processes associated to the melting of glaciers and icebergs. This has paved the way for field measurements at glaciers around Svalbard in summer 2009. The approach presented here is now considered by the Meteorological Office (UK) for inclusion on operational present-weather sensors attached to moored or drifting buoys in polar and high-latitude regions in general.","bibo:AuthorList":["Collins, Melanie Jane"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27385,"sim:weight":0.340705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24691,"sim:weight":0.300075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.269502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30278,"sim:weight":0.261863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31933,"sim:weight":0.258242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.252098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.233273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30695,"sim:weight":0.231258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31144,"sim:weight":0.230016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29808,"sim:weight":0.224232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30668,"sim:weight":0.222127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.222108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.21967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.213182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24022,"sim:weight":0.213136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32061,"sim:weight":0.209827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31869,"sim:weight":0.203739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29494,"sim:weight":0.200779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32133,"sim:weight":0.196852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27536,"sim:weight":0.19327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Such burn wound infection accounts for the pathogenic bacteria by colonising onto burned areas. Therefore, the need for detection and inhibition of such bacterial colonisation requires a methodology for sensing/killing pathogenic bacteria. This research project aims to design a ‗smart‘ wound dressing system which can respond to the microbiological environment of the wound via a simple colour change and will release antimicrobials only when required. Two strains of pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA 476) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) were used in the study. The non-pathogenic bacterium E.coli (DH5α) was used as a control organism as it does not secrete virulence factors and therefore does not lyse membranes of vesicles. The key contributions of this thesis are outlined below. Firstly, an initial responsive nanocapsule system was studied. The fundamental work with giant unilamellar vesicles proved such a responsive system can provide antimicrobial properties when antimicrobial agents were encapsulated within the vesicles. Secondly, partially polymerised vesicles—polydiacetylene/phospholipid vesicles were then developed to improve vesicle stability. The vesicle system was optimised by varying molar concentration of diacetylene monomers (TCDA) in order to obtain relatively stable vesicles as well as sensitivity to the toxins secreted by the pathogenic strains. Measurements proved that the polydiacetylene/phospholipid vesicles can respond to pathogenic bacteria when fluorescent dye/antimcirobials were encapsulated in the vesicles. Finally, a simple prototype dressing was constructed. Plasma polymerised maleic anhydride (pp-MA) deposited onto non-woven polypropylene was shown to be a good method to stabilise vesicles via covalent bonding. Vesicle adhered to pp-MA non-woven polypropylene showed the ability to inhibit/kill the pathogenic strains, quantified by the Japanese Industry Standard assay and also gave a fluorimetric colour response in the presence of pathogenic bacteria when a fluorescent dye is encapsulated within vesicles. Other simple prototypes were also attempted by using hydrogels (gelatine and collagen) to maintain vesicle stability as well as promote tissue healing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhou, Jin"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2811643,"sim:weight":0.474835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51739,"sim:weight":0.249842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24401,"sim:weight":0.177849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929817,"sim:weight":0.157119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85118,"sim:weight":0.150166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.143013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930803,"sim:weight":0.138329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316476,"sim:weight":0.116646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0908904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This afforded a detailed insight into a rich array of context-specific variables impacting on employee perceptions of safety in the company, referenced to leadership style, incident reporting, rule breaking / risk taking, time pressure, communication and reactive approach to addressing safety issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe safety culture assessment was followed by the development and implementation of two safety culture improvement programmes (interventions). Two matched pairs of departments (two experimental and two control) were chosen in which to conduct the interventions. The first intervention comprised a replication (with enhancements) of Zohar’s (2003) safety climate improvement intervention.

The analysis is undertaken within a conceptual framework developed from institutional and agency theory. The need to demonstrate legitimacy and the influence of key groups played a large part in the changes made. Using data collected via participant observation, key informant interviews and documentary evidence, the study examines the changes and management actions that took place during the period between June 2004 and July 2009 in order to identify the strategies that were adopted to manage the tensions between the academic standards and the commercial imperative of meeting shareholder expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe study contributes to the literature covering change in educational institutions and in particular that which reports on the introduction of a more business-oriented approach to the management of universities.

Whilst previous research in\r\nthe last two decades has generally supported the notion that when\r\nappropriately designed HR practices can help enhance organizational\r\noutcomes, there is still ongoing debate regarding how such practices can\r\nactually influence business results. In particular, academics have\r\nhighlighted the importance of the quality of HR implementation, because\r\nthis can affect employee day-to-day experiences of and reactions to the HR\r\npractices which can impact on variance in the business results. In effect, it\r\nis crucial for research to take up the employee lens of the implemented\r\npractices and their reactions to these, if the HR-performance relationship is\r\nto be clearly understood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis thesis contributes to this research agenda by adopting the social\r\nexchange lens to shed light on the nature of the aforementioned relationship.\r\nA multidisciplinary and multilevel HR-performance model was employed\r\nfor conducting empirical tests. Specifically, the empirical model was\r\nconstructed from the literature in three different fields: strategic human\r\nresources management, social exchange theory and psychological contract,\r\nwith the aim of eliciting the nature of employer-employee exchange\r\nrelationships in the HR process. Subsequently, the model was tested using\r\nthe data obtained from 1,286 employees in 149 bank branches and analysed\r\nso as to assess the multilevel process through which HR practices can\r\ninfluence business sales performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe empirical results indicate that an organization can improve branch sales\r\nperformance by paying careful attention to several processes pertaining to\r\nthe implementation of HR practices. That is, through the psychological\r\ncontract process, employees, based on their perceptions of the quality of the\r\nreceived practices (i.e. HR level and breach), reciprocate the organization with their discretionary performance, i.e. commitment attitudes and\r\norganizational citizenship behaviours and these outcomes have an impact on\r\nbusiness results. Moreover, the findings also point to a boundary condition,\r\nwhereby the HR-performance relationship can be enhanced by stressing the\r\nrole of the key constituencies responsible for delivering these practices,\r\nnamely: senior management and the line manager. That is, respectively,\r\nthrough the affective and relational processes, these agents can have an\r\nimpact on employee perceptions of HR level and whether there has been a\r\nbreach of the psychological contract, which in turn influence employee\r\nreactions in the causal chain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn summary, having applied the social exchange perspective to elicit the\r\nemployee interaction with the different quality of HR implementation across\r\nbank branches, this study has contributed to the literature by identifying the\r\nkey processes including psychological contract, relational and affective\r\nprocesses through which HR practices can impact on business sales\r\nperformance, thereby illustrating how an organization’s human resources\r\ncan serve as the source of sustained business competitive advantage.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Popaitoon, Patchara"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108027,"sim:weight":0.277954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340561,"sim:weight":0.271917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26439,"sim:weight":0.187615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A systematic review identifies that studies have focused principally at the organisation-level, and there is a lack of both empirical and theoretical work at the micro-level of analysis highlighting how ambidexterity may be achieved in practical, complex, working structures. The research addresses these micro-mechanisms in the context of the management of projects, a suitable area in that it can be considered as using defined processes together with the flexibility to overcome particular issues that arise. The contribution of the thesis is that it presents an insight into the management of ambidexterity in such an environment, and identifies how multiple knowledge resources are utilised, together with the underlying managerial practices. The level of analysis is the project (specifically, IT-services projects in a major multinational organisation), using the manager as the unit of analysis. The research question is ‘How is ambidexterity achieved at the level of the project?’ This is an opportunity to explore a practical as well as a theoretical gap, in an increasingly important area of business operations. The first stage of the research examines the managerial role in terms of intellectual capital, using a variety of projects. This shows that the sub-components of IC (human, social and organisational/project capital) can each be understood as having co-existing, orthogonal, exploitative and exploratory elements, an important extension of existing theory. The forms of intellectual capital are interwoven not only with each other, but also with the processes of exploitation and exploration, and to conceive of them as separate is an insufficient theorisation. The findings from the qualitative approach are used to investigate the duality of these concepts and bring greater clarity to our understanding of their operationalisation. .This is followed by eight case studies, each using between three and five managerial respondents, together with project data, used to develop a more fine-grained understanding of ambidexterity in a wide range of industrial settings. This shows different managerial configurations (including ‘distributed’ and ‘point’ ambidexterity – an addition to current theory), together with five key managerial practices to enable project-level ambidexterity, identified in the context of project complexity, critical events and constraints.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, Neil"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.378283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340561,"sim:weight":0.325507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Luxury retail draws on the principles of art and magic to assemble the charismatic persona of the creative director and to diffuse his aesthetic ideology to the brand. Moreover, luxury retail strategy enlists magical and aesthetic principles within and without the store to achieve these ends. Finally, retail luxury is producer rather than consumer oriented and seeks to generate awe rather than community.

Initially exploring the concepts of both grief and nation in order to establish the feasibility of national grief as a notion, it goes on to examine the applicability of grief theory, traditionally developed in the context of the individual suffering bereavement, to large-scale national collectives which have undergone significant shared loss. The investigation is conducted with reference to two case studies: the Palestinian people in the aftermath of the loss of their land to the creation of Israel in the nakba of 1948; and Israel itself, as a manifestation of the European Jewish response to the holocaust and the centuries of loss and suffering which led up to it. In both cases, the relevant periods of history are scanned to see to what extent, if any, historical accounts reflect the contours and parameters of the grieving experience as the latter is described and defined in the grief theory literature. In addition, and serving to triangulate the evidence thus gleaned from national history, the contemporary visual arts of both nations, with their observation of and comment on the dominant features and issues of current national identity, are employed as data sources and explored with a view to ascertaining whether they reflect any themes expressive of or pertinent to collective historical loss and grief. The findings from this research into national history and identity within a grief experience framework may serve to open up a new direction for the further development of grief theory. They may also, in revealing the insights afforded by a grief theory perspective on long-term interactions within the global community, offer some contribution to the study of international relations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Malamah-Thomas, Ann"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5225643,"sim:weight":0.468814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340689,"sim:weight":0.233657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108852,"sim:weight":0.232541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108949,"sim:weight":0.216907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930622,"sim:weight":0.212073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84976,"sim:weight":0.208606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.198266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.193269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108970,"sim:weight":0.190809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.173073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.169467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108369,"sim:weight":0.168895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780590,"sim:weight":0.156617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The element holds this central position by virtue of its facile redox chemistry and the high affinity of both redox states (iron II and iron III) for oxygen. These same properties also render iron toxic when its redox-active chelatable \u0027labile\u0027 form exceeds the normal binding capacity of the cell. Indeed, in contrast to iron bound to proteins, the intracellular labile iron (LI) can be potentially toxic especially in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as it can lead to catalytic formation of oxygen-derived free radicals such as hydroxyl radical that ultimately overwhelm the cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms and lead to cell damage. While intracellular iron homeostasis and body iron balance are tightly regulated to minimise the presence of potentially toxic LI, under conditions of oxidative stress and certain pathologies, iron homeostasis is severely altered. This alteration manifests itself in several ways, one of which is an increase in the intracellular level of potentially harmful LI. For example acute exposure of skin cells to ultraviolet A (UVA, 320-400 nm), the oxidising component of sunlight provokes an immediate increase in the available pool of intracellular LI that appears to play a key role in the increased susceptibility of skin cells to UVA-mediated oxidative membrane damage and necrotic cell death. The main purpose of this overview is to bring together some of the new findings related to intracellular LI distribution and trafficking under physiological and patho-physiological conditions as well as to discuss mechanisms and consequences of oxidant-induced alterations in the intracellular pool of LI, as exemplified by UVA radiation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aroun, Asma","Zhong, Julia L","Tyrrell, Rex M","Pourzand, Charareh"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5841426,"sim:weight":0.265182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8754,"sim:weight":0.224481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108070,"sim:weight":0.209716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87260,"sim:weight":0.171756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1557269,"sim:weight":0.171578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.162129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71821,"sim:weight":0.152278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.135463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.127415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5839653,"sim:weight":0.115666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This novel technique involves incorporating a nonane pre-adsorption stage between two successive chemisorption experiments. This method has been used to probe the distribution of platinum amongst the micropores and mesopores of a range of bi-functional PtH-MFI catalysts, each possessing differing surface acidities, which have been used for benzene alkylation with ethane. It has been found that the catalyst with the lowest Si/Al ratio, and thus highest number of acid sites, also possessed the largest metal surface area within its microporosity. This catalyst was also the one that deactivated most rapidly, with coke being deposited predominantly within the micropore network. This was attributed to the bi-functional mechanism for coke formation at higher temperatures. Pulsed-gradient spin-echo NMR has also been used to show that a combination of higher mesopore platinum concentration and higher mass transport rates facilitated greater coke deposition within the mesoporosity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chua, Li M","Hitchcock, Iain","Fletcher,  R.

For example, photovoltaic cells and small wind turbines can be coupled with energy storage systems such as batteries. When used effectively with renewable energy production, batteries can increase the versatility of an energy system by providing energy storage that enables the systems to satisfy the highly variable electrical load of an individual dwelling, therefore changing usage patterns on the national grid. A significant shift towards electric or hybrid cars would also increase the number of batteries required. However, batteries can be inefficient and comprise of materials that have high environmental and energy impacts. In addition, some materials, such as lithium, are scarce natural resources. As a result, the overall impact of increasing our reliance on such \"sustainable or \"low carbon\" systems may in fact have an additional detrimental impact. This paper reviews the currently available data and calculated and highlights the impact of the production of several types of battery in terms of energy, raw materials and greenhouse gases. The impact of the production of batteries is examined and presented in order that future studies may be able to include the impact of batteries more easily within any system.

It is further shown that the giant modifies the free electron content of the lower ionosphere because of electric field-driven ionization, electron attachment and detachment processes.

A\r\nMAV is characterized by its low Reynolds numbers flight regime which makes lift\r\nand thrust creation a significant challenge. One possible solution inspired by nature\r\nis flapping flight, but instead of the large-amplitude low-frequency motion suited to\r\nthe muscular actuators of nature, small-amplitude high-frequency motion may be\r\nmore suitable for electrical actuators. In this thesis the effect of small-amplitude\r\nhigh-frequency motion is experimentally investigated focusing on three aspects:\r\ngeneral performance improvement, deflected jets, and the effect of geometry\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eResults presented herein demonstrate that using small-amplitude high-frequency\r\nplunging motion on a NACA 0012 airfoil at a post-stall angle of attack of 15° can\r\nlead to significant thrust production accompanying a 305% increase in lift\r\ncoefficient. At low Strouhal numbers vortices form at the leading-edge during the\r\ndownward motion and then convect into the wake. This ‘mode 1’ flow field is\r\nassociated with high lift but low thrust. The maximum lift enhancement was due to\r\nresonance with the natural shedding frequency, its harmonics and subharmonics. At\r\nhigher Strouhal numbers the vortex remains over the leading-edge area for a larger\r\nportion of the cycle and therefore loses its coherency through impingement with the\r\nupward moving airfoil. This ‘mode 2’ flowfield is associated with low lift and high\r\nthrust.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt angles of attack below 12.5° very large force bifurcations are observed. These are\r\nassociated with the formation of upwards or downwards deflected jets with the\r\ndirection determined by initial conditions. The upwards deflected jet is associated\r\nwith the counter-clockwise Trailing Edge Vortex (TEV) loitering over the airfoil and\r\nthereby pairing with the clockwise TEV to form a dipole that convects upwards. It\r\ntherefore draws fluid from the upper surface enhancing the upper surface vortex\r\nleading to high lift. The downwards deflected jet is associated with the inverse.\r\nDeflected jets were not observed at larger angles of attack as the asymmetry in the\r\nstrength of the TEVs was too great; nor at smaller amplitudes as the TEV strength\r\nwas insufficient.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo understand the effect of geometry comparable experiments were performed for a\r\nflat plate geometry.

A total of thirty interviews were conducted across six Universities, with five similar roles interviewed in each institution. Respondents were drawn from both centralised and decentralised parts of the organisation, and represented both academic and professional services perspectives. Three ideas are proposed. The first is an emerging New Collegiality in which decision making behaviour is developing that reflects traditional collegial debate, but within new peer groups of academic and professional services managers. Academic managers are also using New Collegiality to share good management practice, with new organisational combinations offering new forms of collaborative working within and across subject disciplines. A second theme proposes that a Higher Education Professional Services Framework exists, which has situationally contingent characteristics that are unique to the professional services in higher education. These features combine decision making and management behaviours to operate as a singular body positioned throughout the organisation in context specific ways. Finally, a third concept identifies three linked levers of management used by the centre to address tensions of internal demands for decentralisation against the external pressures to centralise. These linked levers consist of the creation of an intermediate tier such as a faculty or college, a proactive use of management information as an evidential tool for decision making, and a particular use of the Higher Education Professional Services Framework. The findings suggest that Universities are ostensibly decentralising their organisational structures while simultaneously centralising decision making authority through changes in accountability. These trends raise a number of relevant issues to the professionalisation of higher education.\r\n.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Rixom, Anne"],"dc:date":"2011-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108607,"sim:weight":0.249982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53693,"sim:weight":0.233115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.163547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I look at Naples as a ‘case study’ that illuminates issues brought about by globalisation, notably: 1. the blurring of the traditional distinction between the child as a vulnerable, malleable, and ‘becoming’ individual and the complete and stable adult ‘being’. 2. the different effects of globalisation on childhood in Western and Southern societies. Naples permits the coexistence of the new (Western) independent, internet user, consumer child who takes charge of its own development and the (Southern) marginalised and occasionally almost non-human child. I examine a number of Neapolitan narratives from the mid-1990s to today that represent children from the deprived, crime- and drug-ridden Neapolitan peripheries. I contend that Roberto Saviano’s Gomorra (2006) marked a switch from fictional representations of doomed children to children’s own factual self-representations which focus on acquisition of voice and agency by means of self-reflection and storytelling promoted in schools and community projects.

We call this intrinsic velocity selective recording. However, simulation shows that interpreting the time signals is then not straight-forward and the selectivity Qv is low. New theory shows that bandpass filters improve the selectivity and explains why this is true in the time domain. A simulation study investigates the limits on the available velocity selectivity both with and without additive noise and with reasonable sampling rates and analogue-to-digital conversion (ADC) parameters.

These observations are compared with some predictions of the Kyushu-general circulation model. Good agreement is found between observations of the UFKW in the winds and temperatures, and also with the properties of the waves in the Kyushu-GCM. UFKW are found at periods between 2.5–4.5 days with amplitudes of up to 40 m/s in the zonal winds and 6 K in the temperatures. The average vertical wavelength is found to be 44 km. Amplitudes vary with latitude in a Gaussian manner with the maxima centred over the equator. Dissipation of the waves results in monthly-mean eastward accelerations of 0.2–0.9 m/d/day at heights around 95 km, with 5-day mean peak values of 4 m/sday. Largest wave amplitudes and variances are observed over Indonesia and central Africa and may be a result of very strong moist convective heating over those regions. Rainfall data from TRMM are used as a proxy for latent-heat release in an investigation of the excitation of these waves. No strong correlation is found between the occurrence of large-amplitude mesospheric UFKW events and either the magnitude of the equatorial rainfall or the amplitudes of E1 signatures in the rainfall time series, indicating that either other sources or the propagation environment are more important in determining the amplitude of UFKW in the MLT. A strong semiannual variation in wave amplitudes is observed. Intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) with periods 25–60 days are evident in the zonal background winds, zonal-mean temperature, UFKW amplitudes, UFKW accelerations and the rainfall rate. This suggests that UFKW play a role in carrying the signature of tropospheric ISOs to the MLT region.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davis, Robin N","Chen, Y-W","Miyahara, S","Mitchell, Nicholas J"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":710743,"sim:weight":0.467412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573436,"sim:weight":0.461097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708669,"sim:weight":0.459338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710310,"sim:weight":0.449664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708715,"sim:weight":0.445983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710428,"sim:weight":0.417746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001730,"sim:weight":0.404294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708471,"sim:weight":0.398867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002494,"sim:weight":0.395495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711200,"sim:weight":0.391987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":707969,"sim:weight":0.389645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711323,"sim:weight":0.385924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573432,"sim:weight":0.383231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":707905,"sim:weight":0.374524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711661,"sim:weight":0.372748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":665291,"sim:weight":0.36509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":712048,"sim:weight":0.361781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001346,"sim:weight":0.359017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":712180,"sim:weight":0.357213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711813,"sim:weight":0.354163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Secondly, it contributes to the critical CSR literature by suggesting that unlike broader notions of CSR shared between multiple stakeholders, MNCs practise a form of CSR that undermines the broader stakeholder concept. By increasingly focusing on strategic forms of CSR activity, MNCs are moving away from a societal understanding of CSR that focuses on redressing the impacts of their operations through stakeholder concerns, back to any activity that supports traditional business imperatives.

Or should they increase the risk to the occupants by selecting a less pessimistic vision of the future? It is well known that structural adaptations, such as additional thermal mass, can help moderate internal conditions as can behavioural adaptations, such as opening windows. Here the relative magnitudes of structural and non-structural (behavioural) adaptations are reflected upon, with the specific intent of discovering whether non-structural adaptations might have a great enough effect to offset any errors from selecting what proves to be (in 40 years time) an erroneous choice of climate change projection. It is found that an alteration to how a building is used is as equally important as common structural adaptations, and that the risk of choosing what turns out to be an incorrect climate change projection can be dealt with by seeing non-structural adaptations as a way of nullifying this risk.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coley, David","Kershaw, T","Eames, M"],"dc:date":"2012-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":51844,"sim:weight":0.215118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25055,"sim:weight":0.17648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.153195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here, we experimentally investigate the effects of pain, and its anticipation, in a multitask environment. Using a task-switching paradigm, participants repeated and switched between 3 tasks, of which 1 predicted the possible occurrence of pain. Half of the participants received low intensity pain (N \u003d 30), and half high intensity pain (N \u003d 30). Results showed that pain interferes with the performance of a simultaneous task, independent of the pain intensity. Furthermore, pain interferes with the performance on a subsequent task. These effects are stronger with high intensity pain than with low intensity pain. Finally, and of particular importance in this study, interference of pain on a subsequent task was larger when participants switched to another task than when participants repeated the same task. Perspective: This article is concerned with the interruptive effect of pain on people\u0027s task performance by using an adapted task-switching paradigm. This adapted paradigm may offer unique possibilities to investigate how pain interferes with task performance while people repeat and switch between multiple tasks in a multitask environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Van Ryckeghem, D M L","Crombez, G","Eccleston, Christopher","Liefooghe, B","Van Damme, S"],"dc:date":"2012-02-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929892,"sim:weight":0.502991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85013,"sim:weight":0.282867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108964,"sim:weight":0.15253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.107706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85837,"sim:weight":0.0857107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The data presented in this study is from the interval March 2008 to July 2011. The mean winds observed in the summer-time over Bear Lake Observatory show the meridional winds to be equatorward at meteor heights during April–August and to reach monthly-mean velocities of −12ms−1. The mean winds are closely related to temperatures in this region of the atmosphere and in the summer the coldest mesospheric temperatures occur about the same time as the strongest equatorward meridional winds. The zonal winds are eastward through most of the year and in the summer strong eastward zonal wind shears of up to ~4.5ms−1 km−1 are present. However, westward winds are observed at the upper heights in winter and sometimes during the equinoxes. Considerable inter-annual variability is observed in the mean winds and temperatures. Comparisons of the observed winds with URAP and HWM-07 reveal some large differences. Our radar zonal wind observations are generally more eastward than predicted by the URAP model zonal winds. Considering the radar meridional winds, in comparison to HWM-07 our observations reveal equatorward flow at all meteor heights in the summer whereas HWM-07 suggests that only weakly equatorward, or even poleward flows occur at the lower heights. However, the zonal winds observed by the radar and modelled by HWM-07 are generally similar in structure and strength. Signatures of the 16- and 5-day planetary waves are clearly evident in both the radar-wind data and Aura-temperature data. Short-lived wave events can reach large amplitudes of up to ~ 15 m/s and 8 K and 20 m/s and 10 K for the 16- and 5-day waves, respectively. A clear seasonal and short-term variability are observed in the 16- and 5-day planetary have amplitudes. The 16-day wave reaches largest amplitude in winter and is also present in summer, but with smaller amplitudes. The 5-day wave reaches largest amplitude in winter and in late summer. An inter-annual variability in the amplitude of the planetary waves is evident in the four years of observations. Some 41 episodes of large-amplitude wave occurrence are identified. Temperature and wind amplitudes for these episodes, AT and AW, that passed the Student T-test were found to be related by, AT \u003d 0.34AW and AT \u003d 0.62AW for the 16- and 5-day wave, respectively.","bibo:AuthorList":["Day, Kerry A","Taylor, M J","Mitchell, Nicholas J"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":708612,"sim:weight":0.669025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708715,"sim:weight":0.57065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708669,"sim:weight":0.56318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708556,"sim:weight":0.56298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711323,"sim:weight":0.551366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":707845,"sim:weight":0.532795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708124,"sim:weight":0.521851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002494,"sim:weight":0.520714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708668,"sim:weight":0.518237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710566,"sim:weight":0.499205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710348,"sim:weight":0.483976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708174,"sim:weight":0.479822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710310,"sim:weight":0.476784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":710568,"sim:weight":0.466779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711661,"sim:weight":0.423399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":711917,"sim:weight":0.420073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001295,"sim:weight":0.419316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":707969,"sim:weight":0.418724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573432,"sim:weight":0.410587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001346,"sim:weight":0.409931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of the long-term goals is to provide programmers with a tool that simplifies the development of algorithms for parallel architectures.\r\nPrevious work in the area of automatic parallelisation of code is predominantly concerned with the exploitation of task parallelism in functional languages, such as Lisp\r\nand Haskell, and data parallelism in imperative languages, such as Fortran. In the cases where data-parallelism has been exploited in functional languages, e.g., in Data Parallel Haskell, this has mostly been done by introducing library support for CUDA, OpenCL and other data-parallel frameworks.\r\nThe main focus in the course of this project has been directed towards the optimisation techniques that can be applied to seemingly sequential, functional-style code to\r\nprepare it for automatic parallelisation. The preeminent transformation in this context is the conversion of augmenting recursion and tail recursion into iteration which, consequently,\r\ncan enable the translation of iterative constructs into parallel loops, given that there are no loop-carried dependences.\r\nThee compiler strives to identify natural mapping and reduction constructs in sequential code. Furthermore, a dynamic performance model is employed to ensure that only beneficial sections of the code are parallelised. It is concluded from the initial results, that tenfold to hundredfold speedups can be achieved from the parallelisation of sequential representations of naturally data-parallel constructs, depending on the point\r\nof comparison.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lillehagen, Tommy"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84956,"sim:weight":0.383636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651709,"sim:weight":0.331755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1437379,"sim:weight":0.310002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653036,"sim:weight":0.270725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795327,"sim:weight":0.250844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23657,"sim:weight":0.226718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108875,"sim:weight":0.185678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26009,"sim:weight":0.179614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.168698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Biodiesel is produced commercially by a chemical reaction called\r\ntransesterification which is a chemical process to lower the viscosity of the vegetable oils.\r\nSince Biodiesel is an oxygenated, sulfur free fuel, it typically reduces engine out\r\nemissions except for the oxides of nitrogen (NOX). The chemical and physical properties\r\nof the fatty acids, as well as the effect of molecular structure, determine the overall\r\nproperties of biodiesel fuel. Investigations into the impact of FAME properties on diesel\r\nengines are highly topical, as higher blends of biodiesel are introduced. The aim of this\r\nwork is to perform a comprehensive study on the use of biodiesel fuel in production diesel\r\nengines, and its impact on emissions, performance and fuel consumption.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis thesis has shown that the use of biodiesel fuel reduces the engine out emissions of\r\nCO, HC and PM (except at sub-zero temperatures), and causes a slight increase in NOX\r\nemissions and fuel consumption compared to baseline diesel fuel. However, the lower\r\nexhaust gas temperatures seen when using biodiesel blends leads to reduced catalyst\r\nconversion efficiency and an adverse effect on tailpipe emissions. The cylinder pressure\r\nand rate of heat release profiles of biodiesel blends are very similar to those of baseline\r\ndiesel fuel when similar torque is demanded from the engine with relatively similar start of\r\ncombustion for the main charge. Biodiesel blends show a slightly quicker rise in the rate\r\nof heat release and higher peak values compared to baseline diesel fuel.

BALs are an alternative therapy for the\r\nextremely serious condition of liver failure where liver transplant is currently the only\r\nviable option. As yet, large-scale clinical trials have not been successful enough in order\r\nfor BALs to gain regulatory approval. Through the work in this report, it is envisaged that\r\nBAL design can be improved to the point where they can gain clinical acceptance\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the main issues in BAL design is the provision of adequate oxygen to the cell mass.\r\nTo this end, a mathematical model to describe oxygen mass transport is developed based\r\non the principle of Krogh cylinders. The results of this model are subsequently interpreted\r\nand presented in Operating Region charts, an image of a parameter space that corresponds\r\nto viable BAL designs. These charts allow several important design trends to be identified,\r\ne.g. numerous short and thin hollow fibres are favourable over fewer thicker, longer fibres.\r\nIn addition, it is shown that a physiologically relevant cell number of more than 10% of the\r\nnative liver cell mass can be supported in these devices under the right conditions.\r\nSubsequently the concept of the Operating Region is expanded to include zonation, a\r\nmetabolic phenomenon where local oxygen tension is a primary modulator of liver cell\r\nfunction. It is found that zonation profiles can be well controlled and under standard\r\nconditions a plasma flow rate of 185 ml/min to the BAL would distribute the three\r\nmetabolic zones evenly. Finally, the principles of the Operating Region charts and zonation\r\nare applied to three existing commercial BAL designs; the HepaMate, BLSS and ELAD\r\nsystems. In each case it could be seen that the default designs of each system did not\r\npresent ideal environments for liver cells. Through consideration of zonation profiles, each\r\ndevice design and operating parameters could be optimized to produce in vivo-like\r\nenvironments. In the case of the ELAD, reducing the plasma flow rate from 500 to 90\r\nml/min resulted in a balanced zonation profile. Overall, the work in this report has\r\ndeveloped and detailed a series of tools that will assist a BAL designer in making judicious\r\nchoices over bioreactor design and operating parameters. As a result, it is hoped that BALs\r\ncan take a step forward towards clinical practice and ultimately saving lives.\u003c/p\u003e","bibo:AuthorList":["Davidson, Adam J"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26442,"sim:weight":0.208734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is a salient form of worry, and one that has proven useful in explaining pain severity, disability, and adaptation to treatment in a range of different conditions and settings [7] and [12]. Catastrophizing involves repeated thought about threat as uncontrollable and likely to have awful consequences. These aspects have been captured neatly by Sullivan and colleagues with the labels of “rumination,” “helplessness,” and “magnification” [24]. Catastrophizing was identified as important for children’s adaptation to pain and included in early measurement tools focused on coping [20]. However, interest has been fuelled by the development of the child version of the adult Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the PCS-C [3], [27] and [29]. We suggest that a reappraisal of catastrophic thinking about pain in young people is needed before research blooms. In what follows, we focus on a developmental view of emotional coping, we look again at how catastrophizing about pain has been researched with children, and we suggest an alternative view. Finally, we introduce the research and clinical implications of this reappraisal.","bibo:AuthorList":["Eccleston, Christopher","Fisher, Emma A","Vervoort, T","Crombez, G"],"dc:date":"2012-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.161805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":294473,"sim:weight":0.142275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53847,"sim:weight":0.128963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652016,"sim:weight":0.125677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52204,"sim:weight":0.125593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52188,"sim:weight":0.123933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52200,"sim:weight":0.1236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.114844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In vitro experiments were performed using intact pig skin and barriers from which the stratum corneum had been stripped to different extents to model the less resistant skin of premature babies. Cathodal iontophoretic delivery of phenobarbital was superior to anodal transport and optimised delivery conditions were achieved by reduction of competing co-ion presence in the drug formulation. Phenobarbital transport across intact or partially compromised skin was controlled by iontophoresis which was more efficient than passive diffusion. Across highly compromised skin, however, passive diffusion increased drastically and iontophoretic control was lost.

Six male amateur football players participated in 3 trials applied in a randomized cross-over experimental design. A laboratory-based, football-specific intermittent exercise was allocated for 75 min interspersed with a 15-min recovery, immediately followed by run time to fatigue (RTF) at 80% peak oxygen consumption. In each trial, prior to exercise and during half-time, participants randomly ingested a placebo (PLC), 6.9% CHO, or 4.8% CHO plus 2.1% protein (CHO-P) supplements matched for color and taste. CHO-P resulted in longer RTF (23.02 +/- 5.27 min) than did CHO (16.49 +/- 3.25 min) and PLC (11.00 +/- 2.80 min) (p \u003c 0.05).

The islands’ shallow waters are characterised by a paucity of hydrographic and marine geo-environmental data, which is problematic in view of the requirements of the Maltese Islands to assess the state of their coastal waters by 2012 as part of the EU Marine Strategy Directive. Multibeam echosounder (MBES) systems are today recognised as one of the most effective tools to map the seafloor, although the quantitative characterisation of MBES data for seafloor and habitat mapping is still an underdeveloped field. The purpose of this study is to outline a semi-automated, Geographic Information System-based methodology to map the distribution of habitats in shallow coastal waters using high-resolution MBES data. What distinguishes our methodology from those proposed in previous studies is the combination of a suite of geomorphometric and textural analytical techniques to map specific types of seafloor morphologies and compositions; the selection of the techniques is based on identifying which geophysical parameter would be influenced by the seabed type under consideration. We tested our approach in a 28 km2 area of Maltese coastal waters. Three data sets were collected from this study area: (i) MBES bathymetry and backscatter data; (ii) Remotely Operated Vehicle imagery and (iii) photographs and sediment samples from dive surveys. The seabed was classified into five elementary morphological zones and features - flat and sloping zones, crests, depressions and breaks of slope – using morphometric derivatives, the Bathymetric Position Index and geomorphometric mapping. Segmentation of the study area into seagrass-covered and unvegetated seafloor was based on roughness estimation. Further subdivision of these classes into the four predominant types of composition - medium sand, maërl associated with sand and gravel, seagrass settled on sand and gravel, and seagrass settled on bedrock – was carried out through supervised classifications of morphometric derivatives of the bathymetry and textural indices of backscatter, based on information from training stations. The resulting morphologic and seabed composition maps were combined to plot the distribution of the predominant habitats in the coastal waters offshore NE Malta, some of which are of high conservation value. Ground-truthing of the habitat map using ROV imagery and dive observations confirms that our approach produces a simplified and accurate representation of seafloor habitats while using all the information available within the MBES data sets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Micallef, Aaron","LeBas, Timothy P","Huvenne, Veerle A I","Blondel, Philippe","Huenerbach, Veit","Deidun, Alan"],"dc:date":"2012-05-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27305,"sim:weight":0.341336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54128,"sim:weight":0.334326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84623,"sim:weight":0.333002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23841,"sim:weight":0.317746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384958,"sim:weight":0.306011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28705,"sim:weight":0.299801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14691,"sim:weight":0.289778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108798,"sim:weight":0.27889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385398,"sim:weight":0.266211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84223,"sim:weight":0.262233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31144,"sim:weight":0.259684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513448,"sim:weight":0.252286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.24232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32063,"sim:weight":0.234132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27638,"sim:weight":0.231527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386721,"sim:weight":0.227518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27914,"sim:weight":0.218186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386713,"sim:weight":0.198209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26277,"sim:weight":0.190406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386717,"sim:weight":0.189981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These data were then used to calculate the superfluid density (ρ s) over the full temperature range and fitted to a two-band -model with two full gaps. The results suggest that the superfluid density is shared almost equally between hole and electron pockets and that the larger (electron pocket) gap appears to have an approximately isotropic s-wave order parameter.

Water and oils reduce the glass transition temperature (Tan Delta peak) of pure latex. Oils increase the rubbery storage modulus which may be due to oxidation leading to entangled chains that contribute to resistance to deformation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualise the porous structure of these composites. Further analysis using Image J software showed that increasing the latex content results in the development of small circular (2D) pores. The effect of solvents on the elastic response of coating depends on the chemical nature of the solvent and its molecular size. Linseed oil and water decreased the composite\u0027s storage modulus for 5, 10 and 15pph coatings, in contrast to mineral oil which had a negative impact at relatively higher latex content (50pph). The drop in the strength and storage modulus of solvent saturated latex coatings is proportional to the solvent surface tension to viscosity ratio. The low values of storage modulus were interpreted as low adhesion between CaCO 3 particles and the carboxylated styrene- butadiene matrix. For low latex content coatings, low storage modulus is due to porosity which forms suitable sites for cracks initiation and propagation through the coatings. At higher latex volume fraction coatings the composite behaviour approaches that of pure latex.","bibo:AuthorList":["Touaiti,  F.","Alam,  P.","Toivakka,  M.","Ansell, Martin P"],"dc:date":"2012-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1562824,"sim:weight":0.259142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26749,"sim:weight":0.203653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24739,"sim:weight":0.169891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.161626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930233,"sim:weight":0.12928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5845295,"sim:weight":0.113772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We use Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus - a common coastal breeding shorebird - as an ecological model species to predict the influence of sea level rise. We found that any rise of sea level is likely to inundate 11% of Kentish plover nests. In addition, 5% of the coastal areas of Farasan Islands, which support 26% of Kentish plover nests, will be flooded, if sea level rises by one metre. Our results are constrained by the availability of data on both elevation and bird populations.

In 2003 a 10-year licence was granted to begin a trial to reintroduce the species back to the UK. Here we report on the first 5 years of the trial and assess the progress made towards establishing a founder population. From April 2004 to September 2009 a total of 102 great bustard chicks were imported from Russia and 86 released on Salisbury Plain. Monitoring showed that post-release survival was 18% in the first year following release, and that mortality of released bustards was mainly attributable to predation and collisions. Estimated adult survival was 74%, although the sample size was small. All known surviving great bustards are faithful to the surroundings of the release site, returning throughout the year. A lek has been established where males have been observed displaying to females. The first nesting attempt was in 2007, and in 2009 two females aged 3 and 4 years successfully nested, fledging one chick each. Models incorporating the new demographic estimates suggest that at the end of the 10-year trial period the project can expect to have 8-26 adults as a founder population. © 2012 Fauna \u0026 Flora Internationa.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burnside, Robert J","Carter, I","Dawes, A","Waters, D","Lock, L","Goriup, P","Szekely, Tamas"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108766,"sim:weight":0.166305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15174,"sim:weight":0.139473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108469,"sim:weight":0.137287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.117014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25053,"sim:weight":0.101717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We use a Threshold VAR (TVAR) framework to test for and then estimate a model with endogenous transitions between regimes. We detect two regimes, with a clear transition between them in 2003-4. The pre-reform regime is characterized by high inflation, passive monetary policy and persistent responses to shocks. The post-reform regime is characterized by low inflation, active and credible monetary policy and markedly less persistent responses to shocks. Using a model that contains sufficient variables to capture diverse transmission mechanisms, working through the real exchange rate, domestic credit and monetary policy, we find evidence of sharp changes in transmission mechanisms. Post-reform, the response of Turkey to macroeconomic shocks has changed to be similar to those in other modern, market-orientated economies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Çatik, A N","Martin, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2012-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5844284,"sim:weight":0.296757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108691,"sim:weight":0.230346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26168,"sim:weight":0.211996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.198506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the case of the ionised region of the upper atmosphere, the ionosphere, assimilation techniques are much less mature. The empirical model known as the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) could be used to augment data-sparse regions in an ionospheric now-cast and forecast system. In doing so, it is important that it does not introduce systematic biases to the result. Here, the IRI model is compared to ionospheric observations from the Global Positioning System satellites over Europe and North America. Global Positioning System data are processed into hour-to-hour monthly averages of vertical Total Electron Content using a tomographic technique. A period of twelve years, from January 1998 to December 2009, is analysed in order to capture variations over the whole solar cycle. The study shows that the IRI model underestimates Total Electron Content in the daytime at solar maximum by up to 37% compared to the monthly average of GPS tomographic images, with the greatest differences occurring at the equinox. IRI shows good agreement at other times. Errors in TEC are likely due to peak height and density inaccuracies. IRI is therefore a suitable model for specification of monthly averages of Total Electron Content and can be used to initialise a data assimilation process at times away from solar maximum. It may be necessary to correct for systematic deviations from IRI at solar maximum, and to incorporate error estimation into a data assimilation scheme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chartier, Alex T","Mitchell, Cathryn N","Jackson,  D.

The main glass-forming region was found to occur for 0.40(2) ≤x≤ 0.48(2), where there is insufficient oxygen to form an ideal network of corner-sharing AlO 4 tetrahedra in which the oxygen atoms are twofold coordinated, with another narrow glass-forming region at x \u003d 0.62(2) around the eutectic composition. The glass corresponding to x \u003d 0.4 was chosen for further investigation by using both neutron and x-ray diffraction, and a detailed atomistic model was built by applying a combination of molecular dynamics and reverse Monte Carlo methods. The results show a network structure based predominantly on corner-sharing tetrahedral AlO 4 motifs in which triclusters (OAl 3 units formed by three tetrahedral Al atoms sharing a common vertex) play an integral part, with as many as 21% of the oxygen atoms involved in these configurations. The barium ions bind to an average of 7.4 O atoms, most of which are twofold-coordinated bridging oxygen atoms. The larger size of barium compared to calcium narrows the range of glass-forming compositions in alkaline-earth aluminates such that the main glass-forming range corresponds to a regime in which an oxygen-deficient Al-O network is stabilized by the formation of triclusters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skinner, L B","Barnes, A C","Salmon, Philip S","Fischer, H E","Drewitt, James W E","Honkimäki, V"],"dc:date":"2012-02-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316075,"sim:weight":0.365022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25015,"sim:weight":0.239702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23286,"sim:weight":0.20426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23279,"sim:weight":0.19469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32547,"sim:weight":0.174853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84771,"sim:weight":0.172038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25852,"sim:weight":0.170669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999830,"sim:weight":0.161316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51981,"sim:weight":0.111715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The vectors may be judged to be either Normally distributed or, more generally, second-order exchangeable. We develop the work of Goldstein and Wooff (1998) to show how the familiar univariate finite population corrections (fpc) naturally generalise to individual quantities in the multivariate population. The types of information we gain by sampling are identified with the orthogonal canonical variable directions derived from a generalised eigenvalue problem. These canonical directions share the same co-ordinate representation for all sample sizes and, for equally defined individuals, all population sizes enabling simple comparisons between both the effects of different sample sizes and of different population sizes. We conclude by considering how the fpc is modified for multivariate cluster sampling with exchangeable clusters. In univariate two-stage cluster sampling we may decompose the variance of the population mean into the sum of the variance of cluster means and the variance of the cluster members within clusters. The first term has a fpc relating to the sampling fraction of clusters, the second term has a fpc relating to the sampling fraction of cluster size. We illustrate how this generalises in the multivariate case. We decompose the variance into two terms: the first relating to multivariate finite population sampling of clusters and the second to multivariate finite population sampling within clusters. We solve two generalised eigenvalue problems to show how to generalise the univariate to the multivariate: each of the two fpcs attaches to one, and only one, of the two eigenbases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shaw, Simon","Goldstein, Michael"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.253497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5306355,"sim:weight":0.222154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19444,"sim:weight":0.217855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85460,"sim:weight":0.180951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66108,"sim:weight":0.172759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.171273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108991,"sim:weight":0.167876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108797,"sim:weight":0.162882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931792,"sim:weight":0.156335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As a point of departure, institutional theory has been selected to frame the potential motives for starting an international branch campus. Secondary literature, including professional journals and university reports and websites, has been analysed to obtain information that alludes to the motivations of universities for adopting particular strategies. It was found that university managements’ considerations can be explained by the concepts of legitimacy, status, institutional distance, risk-taking, risk-avoidance and the desire to secure new sources of revenue. We argue that universities should avoid decisions that are based largely on a single dimension, such as legitimacy, but rather consider a broad spectrum of motivations and considerations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilkins, Stephen","Huisman, Jeroen"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In such cases, the standard approach is to average the observed measurements from the individual monitors and use this in a log-linear health model. Hence such studies are ecological in nature being based on spatially aggregated health and exposure data. Here we investigate the potential for bias in the estimates of the effects on health when estimating the short–term effects of air pollution on health. Such ecological bias may occur if a simple summary measure, such as a daily mean, is not a suitable summary of a spatially variable pollution surface. We assess the performance of commonly used models when confronted with such issues using simulation studies and compare their performance with a model specifically designed to acknowledge the effects of exposure aggregation. In addition to simulation studies, we apply the models to a case study of the short–term effects of particulate matter on respiratory mortality using data from Greater London for the period 2002-2005. We found a significant increased risk of 3% (95% CI 1-5%) associated with the average of the previous three days exposure to particulate matter (per 10 μgm−3 PM10).","bibo:AuthorList":["Shaddick, Gavin","Lee, Duncan","Wakefield, Jonathan"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":80759,"sim:weight":0.446988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58519,"sim:weight":0.425063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58797,"sim:weight":0.408157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80765,"sim:weight":0.376181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81294,"sim:weight":0.360287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80762,"sim:weight":0.338822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":664902,"sim:weight":0.233048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85306,"sim:weight":0.219764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50187,"sim:weight":0.207415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25848,"sim:weight":0.170025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85385,"sim:weight":0.167485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As a means of exploring the possibilities of deepening democracy, such frameworks have taken as their focal point the institutionalisation of \u0027alternative\u0027 forms and processes of participation. However, the focus on institutionalisation has usually bypassed the more radical dimensions of the discourses and practices of the movements—the ‘disagreement’ at their heart. By way of illustrative cases of two contemporary movements from Argentina (Piqueteros) and Brazil (Movement of Rural Landless Workers) we focus on two questions: What is the contribution of social movements to the process of democratisation? To what extent is such contribution being captured by new scholarly work on participatory and deliberative democracy? We analyse the political struggle within, against and beyond democratic ‘borders’ led by social movements in three historical moments. By distinguishing the dimensions of ‘real policies’ and ‘imagined politics’ we suggest that new conceptualisations such as ‘participatory democracy’ are unable to recognise the alternative democratic realities that emerge out of disagreement and play a regulatory role in transforming disagreement into dissent. Hope is then lost in translation. We suggest that Radical Democratic Theory can offer a better work of translation, as it is able to grasp the vital dimension of movements’ collective action that resists integration into the hegemonic cannon, thus reflecting the movements’ own reflection of their emancipatory collective action.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dinerstein, Ana C","Ferrero, Juan P"],"dc:date":"2012-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929897,"sim:weight":0.285602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.265572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.250897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.239167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of the research is to find a simple, easy-to-use, low cost and accurate tool which can be used by managers to forecast the sales of new products. A review of the literature suggested that the Bass diffusion model was an appropriate statistical method for new product sales forecasting. For the judgmental approach, after considering different methods and constraints, such as bias, complexity, lack of accuracy, high cost and time involvement, the Delphi method was identified from the literature as a method, which has the potential to mitigate bias and produces accurate predictions at a low cost in a relatively short time. However, the literature also revealed that neither of the methods: statistical or judgmental, can be guaranteed to give the best forecasts independently, and a combination of them is the often best approach to obtaining the most accurate predictions. The study aims to compare these three approaches by applying them to actual sales data. To forecast the sales of new products, the Bass diffusion model was fitted to the sales history of similar (analogous) products that had been launched in the past and the resulting model was used to produce forecasts for the new products at the time of their launch. These forecasts were compared with forecasts produced through the Delphi method and also through a combination of statistical and judgmental methods. All results were also compared to the benchmark levels of accuracy, based on previous research and forecasts based on various combinations of the analogous products’ historic sales data. Although no statistically significant difference was found in the accuracy of forecasts, produced by the three approaches, the results were more accurate than those obtained using parameters suggested by previous researchers. The limitations of the research are discussed at the end of the thesis, together with suggestions for future research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dyussekeneva, Karima"],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1555162,"sim:weight":0.492069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555512,"sim:weight":0.453201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555308,"sim:weight":0.448944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65151,"sim:weight":0.374797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652986,"sim:weight":0.309329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.266152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59026,"sim:weight":0.213318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585490,"sim:weight":0.201258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.194697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.177895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Specifically, the duration of the going phase of movement was found to correlate with synchronization in the beta brain rhythm, in both the planning and executive phases of movement. Inter-Quartile Ranges and average jerk showed correlations with executive brain parameters and ERS/ERDcueBeta, respectively.

The regularity of kinematic/kinetic time series during race walking, the changes in the structure of intra-individual variability over the test session, and the influence of athletic skill in (inter)national rank athletes were investigated. Motion analysis techniques were used. Sample entropy (SampEn) was adopted to examine fluctuations in lower limb angles and ground reaction forces. The regularity of both original and surrogate time series was assessed and compared, by estimating SampEn, to verify the presence of non-linear features in movement variability. SampEn was statistically lower in the original data than in surrogates. In contrast, the regularity of time series did not change significantly throughout the subsequent intra-individual repetitions. Hip and ankle joint angles and vertical ground reaction force manifested increased entropy for skilled athletes. Results suggest that race walking variability was not only the product of random noise but also contained information about the inherent propriety of the neuro-musculo-skeletal system. Furthermore, they provide some indications about neuromuscular control of the lower limb joints during race walking gait, and about the differences between more and less skilled individuals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Preatoni, Ezio","Ferrario, M.","Dona, G.","Hamill, J.","Rodano, R."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1394634,"sim:weight":0.222979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.207595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109023,"sim:weight":0.20448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57381,"sim:weight":0.198159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.185979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22711,"sim:weight":0.185457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26442,"sim:weight":0.184995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.182065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.168223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108928,"sim:weight":0.134402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448029,"sim:weight":0.119774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85829,"sim:weight":0.107714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This, however, does not explain the polymorphism in care strategies and frequent biparental desertion, because theory predicts that one of the two ESSs should have spread to fixation. Using a bootstrapping approach, we demonstrate that taking account of individual variation in payoffs explains the patterns of care better than a model based on the average population payoff matrix. In particular, a model incorporating differences in male attractiveness closely predicts the observed frequencies of male and female desertion. Our work highlights the need for a new generation of individual-based evolutionary game-theoretic models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Van Dijk, Rene E","Szekely, Tamas","Komdeur, J","Pogány, A","Fawcett, T W","Weissing, F J"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2805290,"sim:weight":0.458662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2806257,"sim:weight":0.423828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2806052,"sim:weight":0.33891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.163526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931825,"sim:weight":0.15406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An extension of this efficient strip model which accounts for propagation transverse to the direction of applied compression is derived. In order to provide validation for the strip model a number of laminates were artificially delaminated producing a range of thin anisotropic sub-laminates made up of 0°, ±45° and 90° plies that displayed varied buckling and delamination propagation phenomena. These laminates were subsequently subject to experimental compression testing and nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) using cohesive elements. Comparison of strip model results with those from experiments indicates that the model can conservatively predict the strain at which propagation occurs to within 10 per cent of experimental values provided (i) the thin-film assumption made in the modelling methodology holds and (ii) full elastic coupling effects do not play a significant role in the post-buckling of the sub-laminate. With such provision, the model was more accurate and produced fewer non-conservative results than FEA. The accuracy and efficiency of the model make it well suited to application in optimum ply-stacking algorithms to maximize laminate strength.","bibo:AuthorList":["Butler, Richard","Rhead, Andrew T","Liu, Wenli","Kontis, Nikolaos"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The problem can be reduced to the computation of the discrete spectra of each member of a family of periodic Hermitian eigenvalue problems on a unit cell, parametrised by a two-dimensional parameter - the quasimomentum. These eigenvalue problems involve non-coercive elliptic operators with generally discontinuous coefficients and are solved by adaptive finite elements. We propose an error estimator of residual type and show it is reliable and efficient for each eigenvalue problem in the family. In particular we prove that if the error estimator converges to zero then the distance of the computed eigenfunction from the true eigenspace also converges to zero and the computed eigenvalue converges to a true eigenvalue with double the rate. We also prove that if the distance of a computed sequence of approximate eigenfunctions from the true eigenspace approaches zero, then so must the error estimator. The results hold for eigenvalues of any multiplicity. We illustrate the benefits of the resulting adaptive method in practice, both for fully periodic structures and also for the computation of eigenvalues in the band gap of structures with defect, using the supercell method.","bibo:AuthorList":["Giani,  S.","Graham, Ivan G"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Giani and I G Graham.

This paper examines the propagation of delaminations in a beam under pure bending. A pre-developed analytical model to predict the critical buckling moment of a thin sub-laminate is extended to account for propagation prediction, using mixed-mode fracture analysis. Fractography analysis is performed to distinguish between mode I and mode II contributions to the final failure of specimens. Comparison between experimental results and analysis shows agreement to within 5 per cent in static propagation moment for two different materials. It is concluded that static fracture is almost entirely driven by mode II effects. This result was unexpected because it arises from a buckling mode that opens the delamination. For this reason, and because of the excellent repeatability of the experiments, the method of testing may be a promising means of establishing the critical value of mode II fracture toughness, GIIC, of the material. Fatigue testing on similar samples showed that buckled delamination resulted in a fatigue threshold that was over 80 per cent lower than the static propagation moment. Such an outcome highlights the significance of predicting snap-buckling moment and subsequent propagation for design purposes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kinawy, Moustafa","Butler, Richard","Hunt, Giles W."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Deserting the dependent young is a radical life-history decision that saves resources for future reproduction but that may cause the current brood to fail. Despite the importance of desertion for reproductive success, and thus fitness, the neuroendocrine mechanisms of brood desertion are largely unknown. We investigated two candidate hormones that may influence brood desertion in the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus: prolactin (\u0027parental hormone\u0027) and corticosterone (\u0027stress hormone\u0027). Kentish plovers exhibit an unusually diverse mating and parental care system: brood desertion occurs naturally since either parent (the male or the female) may desert the brood after the chicks hatch and mate with a new partner shortly after. We measured the hormone levels of parents at hatching using the standard capture and restraint protocol. We subsequently followed the broods to determine whether a parent deserted the chicks. We found no evidence that either baseline or stress-induced prolactin levels of male or female parents predicted brood desertion. Although stress-induced corticosterone levels were generally higher in females compared with males, individual corticosterone levels did not explain the probability of brood desertion. We suggest that, in this species, low prolactin levels do not trigger brood desertion. In general, we propose that the prolactin stress response does not reflect overall parental investment in a species where different parts of the breeding cycle are characterized by contrasting individual investment strategies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kosztolányi,  A.","Küpper,  C.","Chastel,  O.","Parenteau,  C.","Yilmaz,  K.

The thickness increased asymptotically to a terminal value of 130μm, limited by the FDG process.

Cake deformation via incremental increases in shear stress demonstrated that the cake\u0027s resilience to tangential fluid shear was inversely proportional to its thickness. It was found that preformed cakes over 250μm thick were deformed by shear stresses \u0026lt;10Nm -2, indicating very loose cohesion between cells on the cake\u0027s surface.

The finding is a significant step for subsequent research to examine the possible applications of clay-filled polymers in selectively removing protein from wine.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tran, A T T","Patterson, Darrell A","James, B J"],"dc:date":"2012-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5845366,"sim:weight":0.349369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1562828,"sim:weight":0.246841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24739,"sim:weight":0.222908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512637,"sim:weight":0.113342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930758,"sim:weight":0.0937835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Formulations are compared using drug concentration profiles as a function of relative SC position; both of these parameters require quantification of SC amount removed per tape. Here, a novel imaging method to quantify SC on tape strips is described. Comparisons are made with established SC quantification methods, specifically weighing and UV pseudo-absorption. Methods: Six stratum corneum tape strips were measured 15 times by the three methods, which were compared for precision, signal:noise ratio, sample size and speed. Furthermore, 600 tape strips were assayed by each method, and correlations examined. Results: Weighing exhibited low precision, extremely low signal:noise ratio, and was slow. UV pseudo-absorption had high precision, acceptable signal:noise ratio and was quick. However, only a fraction of the total SC removed is analysed, and inhomogeneity can affect the results. The new imaging method was precise, with high signal:noise ratio, and measured the whole SC sample, unaffected by inhomogeneity. In addition, the approach was rapid and has the potential for fast automated scanning of multiple tapes and for further image analysis.

The effect of potential and time on the morphology of the NTs is evaluated along with growth efficiency (% of total charge at the electrode used to form the oxide) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, providing an insight into the mechanism of formation of ribs. XPS analysis confirms the presence of fluorine, as TiF 6 2-, and carbon as impurities in the anodic film. The growth efficiency of the process decreases from ∼70% at 10 V to 55-58% at 20-30 V and 14% at 40 V. Similarly, the anodic growth factor (migration of ions expressed as the maximum radius of the \"oxide cell\" per applied potential, nm V -1) decreases at higher potentials, due to oxygen bubbles evolving at the anode at 20-40 V and disrupting the anodizing process. The formation of gas bubbles also affects the morphology of the NTs; while NTs are smooth at 10 V, oxide rings appear over the range 20-40 V. Partial dissolution of the oxide rings due to fluorine ions eventually re-shapes the NTs forming ribs, whereas excessive dissolution over extended anodizing times tends to smoothen the NTs and eventually leads to collapse of the NTs. On the basis of these observations, we suggest oxygen evolution (requiring a minimum amount of water in the electrolyte and a sufficiently high potential 20-40 V) plays a primary role on the formation of ribs on anodized TiO 2 NTs. Ribs are also observed on NTs grown in aqueous electrolytes, although since dissolution is more difficult to control the resulting structure is more irregular than in organic media.","bibo:AuthorList":["Regonini, Domenico","Satka,  A.","Jaroenworaluck,  A.","Allsopp, Duncan W E","Bowen, Christopher R","Stevens, R"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5847493,"sim:weight":0.283596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1567773,"sim:weight":0.208958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268783,"sim:weight":0.199783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1562015,"sim:weight":0.181874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84831,"sim:weight":0.159761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27734,"sim:weight":0.155056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.151742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25014,"sim:weight":0.147311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.134813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22904,"sim:weight":0.125247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26522,"sim:weight":0.118105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85224,"sim:weight":0.0903936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

When the distance D between the confining walls is reduced at constant particle number from an initial value D0, for which a crystalline structure commensurate with the imposed periodicity fits, to smaller values, a succession of phase transitions to imperfectly ordered structures occur. These structures have a reduced number of rows parallel to the boundaries (from n to n − 1 to n − 2, etc.) and are accompanied by an almost periodic strain pattern, due to “soliton staircases” along the boundaries. Since standard simulation studies of such transitions are hampered by huge hysteresis effects, we apply the phase switch Monte Carlo method to estimate the free energy difference between the structures as a function of the misfit between D and D0, thereby locating where the transitions occur in equilibrium. For comparison, we also obtain this free energy difference from a thermodynamic integration method: The results agree, but the effort required to obtain the same accuracy as provided by phase switch Monte Carlo would be at least three orders of magnitude larger. We also show for a situation where several “candidate structures” exist for a phase, that phase switch Monte Carlo can clearly distinguish the metastable structures from the stable one. Finally, applying the method in the conjugate statistical ensemble (where the normal pressure conjugate to D is taken as an independent control variable), we show that the standard equivalence between the conjugate ensembles of statistical mechanics is violated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilding, Nigel"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84847,"sim:weight":0.257744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":21022,"sim:weight":0.240553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108049,"sim:weight":0.228715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.212463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28947,"sim:weight":0.211788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84924,"sim:weight":0.195996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108488,"sim:weight":0.176461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.172712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.127331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.123797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Chapter One reviews the facilitative role mimicry plays in social interactions and the underlying mechanisms of behaviour matching effects. However, the conditions under which mimicry occurs are not well characterised and, although accepted to be an automatic effect, this assumption remains empirically untested. This thesis examined the methods used to elicit mimicry and further explored the mechanisms underlying the effect.\r\n\r\nChapter Two developed a paradigm to demonstrate mimicry relative to a suitable control condition and examined the generalisability of the effect to alternative gestures. However, mimicry was not observed. It was suggested that the target gestures were presented too overtly, and participant’s awareness was responsible for not demonstrating mimicry. Toward the refinement of the paradigm, Chapter Three focused on aspects of gesture presentation, namely, duration of exposure and gesture type. Although Experiment 2 found that mimicry was not influenced by the duration of exposure to target gestures, Experiment 3 showed that mimicry can generalise to alternative, localised, gestures. Crucially, both experiments demonstrated mimicry compared to an equivalent control condition.\r\n\r\nChapters Four and Five examined the automaticity of mimicry, specifically the efficiency and awareness criteria. Experiments 4 and 5 did not allow for clear conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of mimicry. However, the results from Experiment 6 provided clear evidence that lack of awareness is necessary for mimicry to occur and, when mimicry did occur, participants were unaware of their own mimicry behaviour. It was concluded that mimicry meets one of the hallmarks of automaticity; operating without awareness. The results of these experiments are discussed regarding the reliability of the mimicry effect and the methodological and theoretical implications of these findings for the mimicry literature.","bibo:AuthorList":["Emanuel, Lia"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The paper provides an introduction to a model of description that may be used to study the way in which societal needs and priorities and/or curriculum formations are recontextualised within institutions such as schools.

The hemp plant can grow up to 4m over a four month period, with a low fertilizer and irrigation demand, making it very efficient in the use of time and material resources. All parts of the plant can be used – the seed for food stuffs, the fibre surrounding the stem for paper, clothing and resin reinforcement, and the woody core of the stem as animal bedding and aggregate in hemp-lime construction. The unique pore structure of the woody core (shiv) confers low thermal conductivity and thermal and hygric buffering to hemp-lime. The construction technique promotes good air tightness and minimal thermal bridging within the building envelope. All these factors combine to produce low carbon, hygrothermally efficient buildings which are low energy both in construction and in use, and offer opportunities for recycling at end of life. This paper reports on the hygrothermal performance of an experimental hemp-lime building, and on the development of a computerized environmental model which takes account of the phase change effects seen in hemp-lime.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lawrence, Mike","Fodde, Enrico","Paine, Kevin","Walker, Peter"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We have previously identified a mechanism involved in the establishment of tight junction (TJ) cell-cell contacts orchestrated by the protein occludin (Ocln) and its ability to reverse EMT events. Previous studies have suggested an increased functional expression of a cell-surface import system for small peptides, hPepT1, in several types of cancer cells. We now describe two approaches to identify agents capable of re-activating Ocln expression which could be modified into selective substrates of hPepT1. A screen for agents to re-activate suppressed occludin gene (OCLN) expression resulting from Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation led to the identification of several small molecules. Using phage panning we have also identified several short peptide sequences that bind to the E-box used by the suppressor protein Slug to block OCLN expression. Thus, the current studies have identified several molecules and a roadmap to generate additional agents that could be examined for their ability to selectively enter cancer cells via hPepT1. We believe this strategy could result in reduced off-target drug distribution and thus greater functional targeting could be achieved for epithelial-derived cancers to prime them for the actions of established chemotherapeutic agents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Liu, K","Hearne, K","Mrsny, A","Staka, C","Mrsny, Randall J"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.254456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.24468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.242711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929888,"sim:weight":0.179296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.16338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.155486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.137083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This thesis is concerned with \u0027I\u0027 as an early childhood pedagogy instructor, an Israeli-Jew from a Hebrew-speaking culture, working mainly in three educational frameworks in three cultures: an Israeli-Arab college which is predominately Muslim; secondly, as director of a course for Druze care-givers on the occupied Golan Heights and, thirdly, as pedagogy instructor in an academic Teachers\u0027 Training College that is affiliated with the Zionist Kibbutz movement, servicing the multicultural and multinational sectors of the Israeli society.

Whilst we are strongly guided by the reasoning in Kyprianou (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincaré Probab. Stat. 40 (2004) 53–72) for branching Brownian motion, the current paper offers a number of new insights. Our analysis incorporates the role of Seneta–Heyde norming which, in the current setting, draws on classical work of Grey (J. Appl. Probab. 11 (1974) 669–677). We give a pathwise explanation of Evans’ immortal particle picture (the spine decomposition) which uses the Dynkin–Kuznetsov N-measure as a key ingredient. Moreover, in the spirit of Neveu’s stopping lines we make repeated use of Dynkin’s exit measures. Additional complications arise from the general nature of the branching mechanism. As a consequence of the analysis we also offer an exact X(logX)2 moment dichotomy for the almost sure convergence of the so-called derivative martingale at its critical parameter to a non-trivial limit. This differs to the case of branching Brownian motion (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincaré Probab. Stat. 40 (2004) 53–72), and branching random walk (Adv. in Appl. Probab. 36 (2004) 544–581), where a moment ‘gap’ appears in the necessary and sufficient conditions.

Many different techniques for casting doubly-curved shapes have been proposed. Most of them produce elements which exactly match a preconceived design, but at a high cost in manufacture. Fabric formwork techniques (such as those pioneered at the Centre of Architectural Structures and Technology at the University of Manitoba (CAST)) are relatively economical, but require a form-finding approach which takes into account the physics of casting, as well as structural and functional requirements of the finished element. The research presented here involves a specialised methodology for the design and manufacture of optimised concrete elements cast in fabric formwork. Using a novel software tool, our approach lies in between the largely intuitive methods reported by CAST and the precise but expensive computer-controlled manufacturing methods normally used in practice. Combining topological optimisation with computational form-finding, the developed software guides the designer towards a shape that is economical in both material and manufacturability. By combining knowledge of computational structural analysis, optimisation algorithms, fabric simulation and the practical casting techniques of fabric formwork; the gap between structurally optimised forms, and those developed intuitively by fabric casting, can be bridged. This is demonstrated through a case study involving the computational design of a centrally supported slab, supplemented with design studies realised using plaster scale models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bak, Andreas","Shepherd, Paul","Richens, Paul"],"dc:date":"2012-06-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

They were commonly built with very slender profiles compared with modern mass-masonry structures, leading to a common belief among engineers that they have very low margins of safety. These structures remain critical to the transport infrastructure in many parts of the world, and have proven to be very durable, yet very few new drystone retaining walls are built, and walls which do fail are usually replaced with concrete constructions. We show that these walls are ductile even though their components are brittle, and in having tensile strength through the interlocking of their stones, even though they are assembled without any cohesive material such as mortar. These properties are critical to a proper understanding of their behaviour and durability. Full-scale testing of five drystone retaining walls has shown that bulging, most commonly regarded as a sign of incipient failure, begins as a ductile adaptation of the geometry to the loads imposed on it. Localised bulging can be a consequence of small defects in construction or foundation conditions, or concentrated loading, and may be sustained indefinitely in a wall which is in general well-constructed. These insights into the behaviour of walls allow the design of new walls which use materials efficiently, and enable existing walls to be kept in service, and may inspire new ways of achieving ductility in engineering materials.","bibo:AuthorList":["McCombie, Paul","Mundell, Christopher","Heath, Andrew","Walker, Pete"],"dc:date":"2012-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research solely focuses on mathematical applications, given to English and French children aged seven to nine years. The main contribution of this PhD concerns the study of children’s willingness and ability to use affective OLM applications for better learning. The results show that the way children interact with an OLM application depends on its level of openness and student’s control over the learning process. Children seem to want to access their learner model components. Such access, as well as the understanding of the learner model content, is facilitated by affective embodied pedagogical agents. The children using an intelligent tutoring system with a negotiated learner model appeared to learn more than children who used an environment with an editable or inspectable learner model, as their learning gain from during each learning session on software revealed to be higher . The use of two different representations of the learner model content - one representing the children’s self-beliefs, and the other the system’s assessment of knowledge acquisitions – has proven to lead children to be more involved in the representation of what they know by visually comparing their views of how much a specific concept is grasped to the system’s assessment, and engaging in a negotiation process when a disagreement was found, which led them to learn more from the sessions on software. The results and contributions of this thesis should help give evidence of which theories of emotions better apply to children aged seven to eleven working on OLM applications, how children can, want, and effectively use learner model components according to its representation, content, and method of interaction, and therefore help in the design of future affective OLM educational applications for primary school children.","bibo:AuthorList":["Girard, Sylvie"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316486,"sim:weight":0.380406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.329955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.321059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.307947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.242547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is characterized by the presence of intracellular inclusions termed Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neuritis (LNs) in the brain, in which α-Syn aggregates constitute the main component. Therefore, α-Syn aggregation was implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Structurally α-Syn is a disordered protein with little ordered structure under physiological conditions. However, research of α-Syn has provided substantial information about its structural properties. The precise function of α-Syn is still under investigation. Research has also shown that metals, such as copper and iron, accelerate α-Syn aggregation and fibrillation in vitro and are proposed to play an important role in vitro. In this study, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to determine iron binding properties to α-Syn revealing the presence of two binding sites for iron with an affinity of 1.06 x 105 M-1 and a dissociation constant of ~ 10μM which is physiologically relevant to iron content in the brain. In addition, α-Syn was found to reduce iron in the presence of copper. This property was demonstrated via ferrozine based assay. In vitro, thoflavin-T fluorescence assay was used to investigate the mechanism by which metals induce α-Syn aggregation and whether it is related to metal binding. Metals, mainly copper and iron, caused 2-fold increase in the aggregation rate of WT α-Syn and its metal binding mutants. Linking that to the increased metal content in the brain, α-Syn aggregation can cause changes in tissue composition, thus altering the normal functional environment in the brain. Moreover, western blotting analysis showed that copper increases the aggregate formation in mammalian dopaminergic cells over-expressing α-Syn.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moualla, Dima"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1654476,"sim:weight":0.487822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24787,"sim:weight":0.268008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":454760,"sim:weight":0.18144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5846571,"sim:weight":0.176172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23935,"sim:weight":0.17206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5842551,"sim:weight":0.164268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.157594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.136115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.125507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23622,"sim:weight":0.119583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.109763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.101332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An axiomatic complexity measure is defined, allowing various concrete complexity measures for definable functions to be covered. This includes common concrete measures such as the degree of polynomials, and complexity of Pfaffian functions. A generalisation of the Thom-Milnor Bound [17, 19] for sets defined by the conjunction of equations and non-strict inequalities is presented, in the new context of sets definable in o-minimal structures using the axiomatic complexity measure. Next bounds are produced for sets defined by Boolean combinations of equations and inequalities, through firstly considering sets defined by sign conditions, then using this to produce results for closed sets, and then making use of a construction to approximate any set defined by a Boolean combination of equations and inequalities by a closed set. Lastly, existing results [12] for sets defined using quantifiers on an open or closed set are generalised, using a construction from Gabrielov and Vorobjov [11] to approximate any set by a compact set. This results in a method to find a general bound for any set definable in an o-minimal structure in terms of the axiomatic complexity measure. As a consequence for the first time an upper bound for sub-Pfaffian sets defined by arbitrary formulae with quantifiers is given. This bound is singly exponential if the number of quantifier alternations is fixed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clutha, Mahana"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
